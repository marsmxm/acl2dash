<p>Internal "instruction" data structure used by our pretty-printing 
algorithm.</p><p>Our pretty-printing algorithm operates in two linear passes.  The 
first pass builds a list of <i>printer instructions</i> ("pinst" structures) 
that tell the second pass how to print.  (In ACL2's pretty-printer, these 
structures are referred to as "ppr tuples".)</p> 
 
<p>We now define the valid kinds of printer instructions.  To understand these, 
it is very helpful to start with <a href="STR____PRINT-INSTRUCTION.html">print-instruction</a>, the <i>second</i> 
pass of pretty-printing, which follows these instructions to produce its 
output.  You can basically think of <span class="v">print-instruction</span> as an evaluator that 
gives these instructions their semantics.</p>
