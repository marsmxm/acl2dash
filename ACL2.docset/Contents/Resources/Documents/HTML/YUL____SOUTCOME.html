</dl><p>According to [Yul: Specification of Yul: Formal Specification], 
     the execution of a statement results in 
     not only possibly updated global and local states, 
     but also a mode. 
     [Yul: Specification of Yul: Formal Specification] 
     does not have an explicit name for this notion, 
     which in our formalization consists of 
     a computation state and a mode. 
     We call this a statement outcome.</p>
