<p>C function environments for ATC.</p><p>C code is executed in the context of function definitions in scope, 
     which may be referenced by the code.</p><p>Here we formalize a notion of function environment as a finite map 
     from function names (i.e. identifiers) 
     to information about the functions. 
     These function environments are used in the dynamic semantics.</p>
