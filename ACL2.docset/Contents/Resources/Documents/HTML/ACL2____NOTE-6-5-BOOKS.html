 <h2>Organization, Build, and Licensing Changes</h2> 
 
 <h3>Deleted Stubs</h3> 
 
 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous 
 location to help you transition your <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> commands.  The <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> build system prints warnings when a stub book is being 
 included.</p> 
 
 <p>Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books were stubs 
 in ACL2 6.4, so we've deleted them.</p>

 <h3>Book Reorganization</h3> 
 
 <p>We've moved several books to new homes in an effort to improve the overall 
 organization of the books.  Users of these libraries will need to update their 
 <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> commands, and in some cases, packages have also 
 changed.</p> 
 
 <p>The table below shows which libraries have moved and where they have moved 
 to.  Books with stubs may continue to work until the next release, but you'll 
 need to update your <span class="v">include-book</span>s eventually.</p>

----------------------------------------------------------------------</pre> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> commands for <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a>, <a href="ACL2____STD_F2STRINGS.html">std/strings</a>, <a href="ACL2____STD_F2OSETS.html">std/osets</a>, and <a href="ACL2____STD_F2BITSETS.html">std/bitsets</a> have been merged into a single 
 <span class="v">std/package.lsp</span> file, with a single corresponding <span class="v">std/portcullis.lisp</span> 
 file, to simplify package management.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Name Conflict Resolution</h3> 
 
 <p>Preliminary work has been carried out toward unifying coi/std versions of 
 osets.  In particular:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____STD_F2OSETS.html">std/osets</a> package has been changed from <span class="v">SETS</span> to <span class="v">SET</span>.</li> 
 <li>The <span class="v">coi/osets</span> library now uses the <span class="v">std/osets</span> package files.</li> 
 <li>Some <span class="v">coi/osets</span> books now merely include the corresponding files from 
 <span class="v">std/osets</span>.</li> 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS.html">std/lists</a> function <span class="v">repeat</span> has been renamed to <a href="ACL2____REPLICATE.html">replicate</a>, and had its arguments reordered, to resolve a name clash with the 
 coi library.  See <a href="https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/issues/detail?id=136" target="_blank"><nobr>Issue 136<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/issues/detail?id=136"></nobr></a> 
 for additional discussion about this change.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">data-structures</span> library <span class="v">STRUCTURES</span> package has been renamed to 
 <span class="v">DEFSTRUCTURE</span> to resolve a name conflicts with the COI books.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____BITOPS.html">bitops</a> library's <span class="v">sign-extend</span> function has been renamed to 
 <a href="ACL2____FAST-LOGEXT.html">fast-logext</a> to resolve a name conflict with the <a href="ACL2____RTL.html">rtl</a> 
 library.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">tools/book-conflicts</span> tool can be used to detect name conflicts 
 between books.  See its <span class="v">README</span> file for more information.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Build System Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>Support for ACL2(r) is now directly included in the top-level Makefile. 
 ACL2(r) users no longer need to use a separate build process and can now make 
 use of many additional books.  Books that are incompatible with ACL2(r) should 
 be annotated with <span class="v">non-acl2r</span> <span class="v">cert_param</span>s, and books that require 
 ACL2(r) should have a <span class="v">uses-acl2r</span> cert_param.</p> 
 
 
 <p>The top-level Makefile has been made more robust in various ways.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Certification of books under <span class="v">models/y86</span> has a cleaner implementation. 
 These books are no longer certified by the <span class="v">make</span> target <span class="v">all</span> since they 
 are resource intensive.  For ACL2(h) and host Lisps that can handle this task, 
 they are certified by using the target <span class="v">everything</span>.  Also, the value of the 
 <span class="v">-j</span> option of the <span class="v">make</span> command is no longer ignored.</li> 
 
 <li>It no longer tries to build certain long-running books when USE_QUICKLISP 
 is set and Hons is not present.</li> 
 
 <li>It no longer tries to build the <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> solutions book, as this can 
 overwhelm modest machines.</li> 
 
 <li>A new <span class="v">ccl-only</span> <span class="v">cert_param</span> can be used for books that require CCL. 
 Used this to avoid trying to certify certain books that require, e.g., <a href="ACL2____TSHELL.html">tshell</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____ESIM-TUTORIAL.html">esim-tutorial</a> books have been removed from <span class="v">doc/top.lisp</span> to 
 avoid requiring Glucose to build the ACL2+Books manual.</li> 
 
 <li>Certain problematic books have been annotated with <a href="ACL2____NON-PARALLEL-BOOK.html">non-parallel-book</a>, to avoid incompatibilities with <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">waterfall-parallelism</a> problems on ACL2(p).</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 
 <p>The <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> build system has been enhanced in many ways.  Of 
 particular note, it now deals more automatically with portcullis files, which 
 may help to improve the reliability of including uncertified files.  Other 
 improvements include:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
  <li>Better support for generated books</li> 
  <li>Support for ACL2 images that start up in other packages</li> 
  <li>Enhanced <span class="v">--help</span> message with more information</li> 
  <li>Added support for <a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">add-include-book-dir!</a>
</li> 
  <li>More informative error messages in certain cases</li> 
  <li>Miscellaneous, minor bug fixes, e.g., support for <span class="v">$</span> in book names.</li> 
 </ul> 
 
 
 <p>The build speed has been improved in various ways.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Many books have reordered <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> to take advantage of new 
 optimizations in ACL2.</li> 
 
 <li>The performance of the <span class="v">tau/bounders/elementary-bounders</span> book has been 
 significantly improved, reducing the critical path time for the <span class="v">make all</span> 
 target.</li> 
 
 <li>A computationally expensive proof has been split out of the 
 <span class="v">defung-stress</span> book, also substantially improving the critical path for 
 <span class="v">make all</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>Reduced dependencies in <a href="ACL2____STD_F2UTIL.html">std/util</a>, <a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS.html">std/lists</a>, <a href="ACL2____STD_F2ALISTS.html">std/alists</a>, and <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> to speed up certification.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Added a TAGS target to the Makefile.</p> 
 
 <p>Added scripts to support using a <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" target="_blank"><nobr>Jenkins<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://jenkins-ci.org/"></nobr></a> continuous integration server to 
 continually rebuild ACL2 and the books on various platforms.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>Books contributed by Computational Logic, Inc. are now licensed under 
 a (more permissive) 3-clause BSD style license instead of the GNU General 
 Public License.</p> 
 
 <p>Books contributed by Centaur Technology, Inc. are now licensed under a (more 
 permissive) MIT/X11 style license instead of the GNU General Public 
 License.</p> 
 
 <p>Books contributed by Jared Davis / Kookamara are now licensed under an 
 MIT/X11 style license instead of the GNU General Public License.</p> 
 
 <p>Many books that lacked explicit licensing information have been updated to 
 include appropriate copyright headers.</p> 
 
 
 <h2>New Libraries, Demos, and Documentation</h2> 
 
 <h5>New Libraries and Tools</h5> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">workshops/2014</span> directory contains contributions from the ACL2 
 Workshop for 2014.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="ACL2____REMOVE-HYPS.html">remove-hyps</a> tool may be useful for identifying unnecessary 
 hypotheses in theorems.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a> is a new library offers functionality similar to <a href="ACL2____STD.html">std</a> 
 or <a href="ACL2____DEFDATA.html">defdata</a> libraries.  This library enforces a certain fixing-function 
 discipline and may help to avoid many type-like hypotheses on theorems.</p> 
 
 <p>The new book <span class="v">tools/rewrite-with-equality.lisp</span> is a certified clause 
 processor that causes certain equality hypotheses to cause massive substitution 
 of the "good" term for the "bad" term in clauses that are stable under 
 simplification.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="ACL2____WITH-SUPPORTERS.html">with-supporters</a> macro can be used to automatically produce 
 redundant versions of events that are needed from local include books.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="FLAG____DEF-DOUBLEVAR-INDUCTION.html">flag::def-doublevar-induction</a> macro can be used to create 
 certain kinds of induction schemes, and may be especially useful for proving 
 <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> rules about mutually recursive functions.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="ACL2____NREV.html">nrev</a> book is something like <span class="v">nreverse</span>.  It can be used to 
 implement in-order, tail-recursive list processing functions.  With a trust 
 tag, these functions can avoid the memory overhead of a final <a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-POP.html">fast-alist-pop</a> function provides something akin to 
 <span class="v">remhash</span> for fast alists, with various restrictions and limitations.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">system/hons-check</span> books provide some basic tests for the <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a> code.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">oracle/</span> directory contains tools and examples from Oracle, 
 Inc.</p> 
 
 <h5>New Demos</h5> 
 
 <p>A new demo, <span class="v">demos/tutorial-problems/equivalence-of-two-functions</span>, shows 
 some ways to prove the equivalence of two functions that recur in different 
 ways.</p> 
 
 <p>A new demo, <span class="v">demos/knuth-bendix-problem-1.lisp</span>, has been added.</p> 
 
 <p>COI's <span class="v">defung</span> has a new fractran example: see 
 <span class="v">coi/defung/fractran.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new demo, <span class="v">demos/gl-and-use-example.lisp</span>, shows a way to use GL to 
 establish the crux of an unbounded theorem.</p> 
 
 
 <h5>New Documentation</h5> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">cowles</span>, <a href="ACL2____ARITHMETIC-1.html">arithmetic-1</a>, and <a href="ACL2____RTL.html">rtl</a> libraries now 
 have some XDOC documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>There are now some preliminary recommendations for <a href="ACL2____BEST-PRACTICES.html">best-practices</a> for 
 developing ACL2 books.</p> 
 
 <p>The documentation for portions of the <a href="ACL2____IHS.html">ihs</a> library and <a href="ACL2____PLEV.html">plev</a> had 
 been inadvertently excluded from the manual, but are now included.</p> 
 
 <p>A new topic describes some noteworthy <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR-TOOLS.html">clause-processor-tools</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The topic hierarchy has received some attention, e.g., all topics that were 
 formerly listed under the grab-bag <span class="v">switches-parameters-and-modes</span> have been 
 relocated to more suitable homes.</p> 
 
 <p>Converted the documentation for <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>, <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a>, and other topics 
 into <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> format.</p> 
 
 <p>Many topics have been improved by eliminating typos, making minor 
 clarifications, adding appropriate cross-references, fixing broken links, and 
 ensuring that <span class="v">:parents</span> are correct.</p> 
 
 
 
 <h2>Changes to Major Libraries</h2> 
 
 <h3>XDOC Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="XDOC____ORDER-SUBTOPICS.html">xdoc::order-subtopics</a> command can be used to control the 
 order that subtopics are presented in.</p> 
 
 <p>The "classic" XDOC viewer is no longer supported.</p> 
 
 <p>The XDOC viewers have been improved in many ways.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Fancy manuals now produce a clear error message for users of IE8 and IE9, 
 and will work properly for users of IE11.  (IE10 still works, as before).</li> 
 
 <li>Fancy manuals now load much more quickly (faster jump-to box 
 initialization).</li> 
 
 <li>The :doc command and the <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> tool now show URLs for external 
 links.</li> 
 
 <li>XDOC now includes tools that can create a <a href="http://www.sitemaps.org/" target="_blank"><nobr>sitemap<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.sitemaps.org/"></nobr></a> and other "static" HTML files, 
 which may be useful for search engine optimization.</li> 
 
 <li>Added <span class="v">.htaccess</span> files to fancy manuals, which can enable server-side 
 compression for significant file size/performance improvements.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 
 <p>Various bugs have also been fixed in the core XDOC system.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">@(def ...)</span> directive sometimes printed the wrong event; this has 
 been fixed.  It also now handles mutually recursive functions more nicely.</li> 
 
 <li>The <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">xdoc::save</a> command should no longer cause an error when trying 
 to write manuals to paths like <span class="v">~/my-manual</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>Fixed bugs in XDOC's handling of <span class="tt">@('...')</span> and <span class="tt">@({...})</span> 
 directives, and otherwise improved error messages with more context.</li> 
 
 <li>Fixed a problem with <a href="ACL2____XDOC-EXTEND.html">xdoc-extend</a> when the topic to extend 
 lacked a <span class="v">:long</span> string.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Other minor changes:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>XDOC now uses <a href="STR____PRETTY.html">str::pretty</a> instead of <a href="ACL2____FMT-TO-STRING.html">fmt-to-string</a> and the 
 preprocessor uses <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> less than before.</li> 
 
 <li>Factored xdoc tests out of the main directory and excluded them from the 
 basic build, to improve build times.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 
 
 <h3>
<a href="ACL2____STD.html">Std</a> Library Changes</h3> 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2BASIC.html">std/basic</a></h5> 
 
 <p>A new book of basic <a href="ACL2____INDUCTION-SCHEMES.html">induction-schemes</a> has been added.</p> 
 
 <p>Certain equivalence relations like <a href="ACL2____CHAREQV.html">chareqv</a> and <a href="ACL2____STREQV.html">streqv</a> have 
 been factored out of the <a href="ACL2____STD_F2STRINGS.html">std/strings</a> library and moved into 
 <span class="v">std/basic</span> instead, mainly to improve integration with the new <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a> library.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____LNFIX.html">lnfix</a> and <a href="ACL2____LIFIX.html">lifix</a> are now enabled, inlined functions instead of 
 macros.  This may help to simplify guard obligations in functions that call 
 <span class="v">lnfix</span> and <span class="v">lifix</span>.</p> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS.html">std/lists</a></h5> 
 
 <p>An <a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS_F2UPDATE-NTH.html">std/lists/update-nth</a> book has been added.</p> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">remove-duplicates</span> book has been added with lemmas about <a href="ACL2____REMOVE-DUPLICATES-EQUAL.html">remove-duplicates-equal</a> and <a href="ACL2____HONS-REMOVE-DUPLICATES.html">hons-remove-duplicates</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a missing rule about <a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a> to 
 <span class="v">std/lists/acl2-count</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____UNIQUEP.html">uniquep</a> no longer uses <a href="ACL2____EQUALITY-VARIANTS.html">equality-variants</a>.  Theorems that 
 target <span class="v">uniquep</span> should be rewritten in terms of <span class="v">no-duplicatesp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Various books have been reorganized to reduce dependencies.</p> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2ALISTS.html">std/alists</a></h5> 
 
 <p>The general purpose alist functions <a href="ACL2____APPEND-ALIST-VALS.html">append-alist-vals</a> and <a href="ACL2____APPEND-ALIST-KEYS.html">append-alist-keys</a> have been moved out of <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> and into <a href="ACL2____STD_F2ALISTS.html">std/alists</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>There are new books for <a href="ACL2____ALIST-FIX.html">alist-fix</a> and <a href="ACL2____HONS-REMOVE-ASSOC.html">hons-remove-assoc</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">fast-alist-clean</span> book includes lemmas about <a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-FORK.html">fast-alist-fork</a> and <a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-CLEAN.html">fast-alist-clean</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Various books have been reorganized to reduce dependencies.</p> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2OSETS.html">std/osets</a></h5> 
 
 <p>Most osets functions are now disabled by default.  They can be re-enabled 
 using the ruleset <span class="v">set::definitions</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Some useful but sometimes expensive rules, including for instance the <a href="SET____PICK-A-POINT-SUBSET-STRATEGY.html">set::pick-a-point-subset-strategy</a> and <a href="SET____DOUBLE-CONTAINMENT.html">set::double-containment</a>, and also 
 including other rules such as the transitivity of <a href="SET____SUBSET.html">set::subset</a>, are now 
 disabled by default.  They can be re-enabled using the ruleset 
 <span class="v">set::expensive-rules</span>.</p> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2UTIL.html">std/util</a></h5> 
 
 <p>Some new macros have been added.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____DEFINES.html">defines</a> can introduce mutually recursive functions, using a 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a>-like syntax, and features automatic integration with <a href="ACL2____MAKE-FLAG.html">make-flag</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____DEFVAL.html">defval</a> is like <a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> but has <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> integration.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="STD____DEFSUM.html">std::defsum</a> is a preliminary macro for tagged union types.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="STD____DEFAGGRIFY-DEFREC.html">std::defaggrify-defrec</a> adds <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">std::defaggregate</a>-style emulation 
 for structures introduced using <span class="v">defrec</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> macro has been improved in many ways.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>It has been modified to make it easier to extend, largely in support of 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFINES.html">defines</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>It now uses <a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> to avoid printing so much output.</li> 
 
 <li>Theorems introduced by <a href="STD____RETURNS-SPECIFIERS.html">std::returns-specifiers</a> now often have better 
 names, and the name can also be controlled using <span class="v">:name</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The new <a href="ACL2____MORE-RETURNS.html">more-returns</a> macro allows for additional <a href="STD____RETURNS-SPECIFIERS.html">std::returns-specifiers</a> style theorems after a <span class="v">define</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>A performance bug with the <a href="STD____VAR-IS-STOBJ-P.html">std::var-is-stobj-p</a> function, notably 
 used by <span class="v">define</span>, has been fixed.</li> 
 
 <li>Experimental <i>post-define hooks</i> can allow for custom actions to be 
 carried out after submitting a <span class="v">define</span>; such a hook allows for a tight 
 integration between <span class="v">define</span> and the new <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a> library.</li> 
 
 <li>New options allow you to avoid introducing an encapsulate and to name and 
 save the termination proof.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Other macros have also been improved in various ways.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<a href="STD____DEFREDUNDANT.html">std::defredundant</a> tool has been expanded to better handle <a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a> and <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro 
 aliases</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____DEFMVTYPES.html">defmvtypes</a> now has smarter handling of <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="STD____DEFENUM.html">std::defenum</a> now automatically produces a fixing function and 
 forward-chaining rule to give the possible values of the objects.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____DEFRULE.html">defrule</a> now has a <span class="v">:local</span> option.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="STD____DEFLIST.html">std::deflist</a> is now smart enough to tell whether functions are 
 defined; its former <span class="v">:already-definedp</span> option is now useless and, hence, 
 deprecated.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="STD____DEFPROJECTION.html">std::defprojection</a> now uses <a href="ACL2____NREV.html">nrev</a> instead of optimizing 
 things with <span class="v">nreverse</span> directly, reducing the use of trust tags.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="STD____DEFPROJECTION.html">std::defprojection</a> now accepts <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a>-like syntax for 
 <a href="STD____EXTENDED-FORMALS.html">std::extended-formals</a> and <a href="STD____RETURNS-SPECIFIERS.html">std::returns-specifiers</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>A bug with <a href="STD____DEFPROJECTION.html">std::defprojection</a>'s <span class="v">subsetp</span> theorem has been 
 fixed.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Many macros now have a <span class="v">:verbosep</span> option that can be used to disable 
 output suppression.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">std/util</span> testing code has been factored out into a new 
 <span class="v">std/util/tests</span> directory.</p> 
 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2TYPED-LISTS.html">std/typed-lists</a></h5> 
 
 <p>There are now books for many built-in ACL2 list recognizers that were 
 previously not covered, e.g., <a href="ACL2____BOOLEAN-LISTP.html">boolean-listp</a>, <a href="ACL2____INTEGER-LISTP.html">integer-listp</a>, 
 etc.</p> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2STRINGS.html">std/strings</a></h5> 
 
 <p>Many logical definitions throughout the <a href="ACL2____STD_F2STRINGS.html">std/strings</a> library have been 
 cleaned up.  Also, many definitions have been changed to use <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> 
 for better documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>The new book <span class="v">std/strings/defs-program</span> contains <a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a> mode 
 definitions of most functions in the <span class="v">std/strings</span> library.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="STR____PRETTY.html">str::pretty</a> routine can convert arbitrary ACL2 objects into 
 pretty-printed strings.  Is a fast, state-free, logic mode reimplementation of 
 much of ACL2's pretty printer.</p> 
 
 <p>There are now a much richer collection of numeric functions, especially for 
 non-decimal bases; see <a href="STR____NUMBERS.html">str::numbers</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The string library now has a very efficient, bitset-like way to represent 
 sets of characters, and some functions for working with these character 
 sets. See <a href="STR____CHARSET-P.html">str::charset-p</a>.</p> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">std/io</a></h5> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____READ-STRING.html">read-string</a> function will now produce better error messages and 
 can (optionally, via raw Lisp) avoid checking <span class="v">bad-lisp-objectp</span>. </p> 
 
 
 <h3>Defdata Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>Defdata's output has been tweaked.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFDATA.html">defdata</a> library now supports range types.</p> 
 
 <p>Counterexample generation has been updated to use tau instead of the former 
 <span class="v">graph-tc</span> book, and has many other updates.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>COI Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>COI's <span class="v">def::signature</span> macro now has support for generalized 
 congruences.</p> 
 
 
 
 <h3>
<a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">Quicklisp</a> and <a href="ACL2____OSLIB.html">oslib</a>
</h3> 
 
 <p>The experimental <a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">quicklisp</a> build has been updated in many ways. 
 Quicklisp files are now installed under the <span class="v">centaur/quicklisp/inst</span> 
 directory instead of the user's home directory.</p> 
 
 <p>The Quicklisp install can be carried out using a proxy.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">quicklisp</a> books now include support for the <span class="v">bordeaux-threads</span> 
 and <span class="v">hunchentoot</span> libraries.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="OSLIB____GETPID.html">oslib::getpid</a> has been extended to work on Lisps other than CCL.</p> 
 
 <p>Added minimal tests to <a href="ACL2____OSLIB.html">oslib</a> functions such as <a href="OSLIB____FILE-KIND.html">oslib::file-kind</a> and <a href="OSLIB____DATE.html">oslib::date</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>OSLIB has new <a href="OSLIB____LISP-TYPE.html">oslib::lisp-type</a> and <a href="OSLIB____LISP-VERSION.html">oslib::lisp-version</a> functions.</p> 
 
 <p>A new book, <span class="v">centaur/misc/sharedlibs</span>, may be useful for relocating <a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> images that require shared libraries for CCL/Linux systems.</p> 
 
 <p>We have remove dependencies on <span class="v">iolib</span> since its build does not seem to 
 be reliable.</p> 
 
 
 <h2>Changes to Centaur Libraries</h2> 
 
 
 <h3>
<a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">rtl9</span> library has been updated to better support GL.</p> 
 
 <p>GL has better <a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> handling, and as a result may be better able to cope 
 with unsatisfiable path conditions (i.e., unreachable code regions) when using 
 SAT-based <a href="GL____MODES.html">gl::modes</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>New <a href="GL____PREFERRED-DEFINITIONS.html">gl::preferred-definitions</a> may slightly improve performance of 
 bit-vector operations like <a href="ACL2____LOGCAR.html">logcar</a>, <a href="ACL2____LOGCDR.html">logcdr</a>, <a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a>, and 
 <a href="ACL2____LOGTAIL.html">logtail</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Some symbolic arithmetic functions have been changed so as to possibly 
 improve AIG performance.</p> 
 
 <p>GL's rewrites to <a href="ACL2____4V.html">4v</a> constants have been improved.</p> 
 
 <p>The new macro <a href="GL____GL-THM.html">gl::gl-thm</a> is like <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a>, but doesn't 
 store the theorem.  That is, it's like <a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> is to <a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a>. 
 Similarly, <a href="GL____GL-PARAM-THM.html">gl::gl-param-thm</a> is to <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-PARAM-THM.html">def-gl-param-thm</a>, and <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-RULE.html">def-gl-rule</a> is similar to <a href="ACL2____DEFRULE.html">defrule</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The definitions of <span class="v">def-gl-thm</span>, etc., have been simplified, <a href="ACL2____GL-HINT.html">gl-hint</a> can now be told which GL clause processor to use.</p> 
 
 <p>Minor bugs have been fixed.</p> 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>GL's <a href="GL____DEF-GL-REWRITE.html">gl::def-gl-rewrite</a> macro has been reworked to avoid the 
 possibility of dropping rules when books are included in different orders.</li> 
 
 <li>The GL interpreter now uses the <span class="v">clk</span> from the given <a href="GL____GLCP-CONFIG.html">gl::glcp-config</a>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The documentation for GL has been generally improved.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>
<a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> Verilog Toolkit</h3> 
 
 <p>VL has been significantly refactored.  All of the internal <a href="VL____SYNTAX.html">vl::syntax</a> 
 is now based on <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a>, which is a major change.  The representation 
 of <a href="VL____STATEMENTS.html">vl::statements</a> is especially different.</p> 
 
 <p>VL is beginning to gain support for some limited SystemVerilog constructs. 
 This is a major change that affects all areas, e.g., lexing, parsing, syntax, 
 and transformations.</p> 
 
 <p>VL now support certain kinds of combinational always blocks.  It also 
 supports richer edge-triggered always blocks, including, e.g., registers with 
 asynchronous set/reset signals.</p> 
 
 <p>Many bugs have been fixed, some severe.  For instance, VL was incorrectly 
 translating BUF, NOT, and XNOR gates with "extra" terminals.  The new VL 
 <span class="v">systest</span> directory includes various end-to-end tests of VL's translations 
 of certain modules.</p> 
 
 <p>Warnings have been improved.  For instance, VL now warns about 0-bit 
 replications since some Verilog tools do not implement them correctly.</p> 
 
 <p>Many ttags have been removed from VL, using <a href="ACL2____NREV.html">nrev</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>VL's always/delay transforms can now optionally produce less bitblasted 
 modules.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="VL____KIT.html">vl::kit</a> includes new commands such as <span class="v">vl gather</span> and many 
 commands have additional options.  It also now prints backtraces on errors for 
 improved debugging.</p> 
 
 <p>Numerous other minor bug fixes, extensions, performance improvements, 
 etc.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Other Centaur Libraries</h3> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a> now uses <span class="v">glucose-cert</span> instead of <span class="v">lingeling</span> as the 
 default SAT solver.</p> 
 
 <p>The default <a href="ACL2____SEXPR-REWRITING.html">sexpr-rewriting</a> rules have been expanded and improved. 
 These changes may improve decomposition proofs and also the performance of 
 GL-based STV proofs.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____TSHELL.html">tshell</a> should now handle interrupts more reliably.</p> 
 
 <p>The executable counterparts of <a href="ACL2____SYMBOLIC-TEST-VECTORS.html">symbolic-test-vectors</a> are now disabled 
 by default.</p> 
 
 <p>There is now better support for decomposition proofs of <a href="ACL2____SYMBOLIC-TEST-VECTORS.html">symbolic-test-vectors</a>, see files such as 
 <span class="v">centaur/esim/stv/stv-decomp-proofs*</span> and 
 <span class="v">centaur/regression/composed-stv.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="ACL2____STV-RUN-FOR-ALL-DONTCARES.html">stv-run-for-all-dontcares</a> function is a less conservative 
 alternative to <a href="ACL2____STV-RUN.html">stv-run</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Some lemmas have been localized in <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> now has a basic <span class="v">aignet-print</span> function for debugging.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="BRIDGE____JSON-ENCODING.html">bridge::json-encoding</a> routines now use <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> for better 
 documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>Some <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> functions and <span class="v">numlist</span> are now tail recursive.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____BITOPS.html">bitops</a> <span class="v">ihsext-basics</span> book has additional rules about <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGNOT.html">lognot</a> and <a href="ACL2____LOGMASK.html">logmask</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved and documented the <a href="ACL2____LOGBITP-REASONING.html">logbitp-reasoning</a> hint.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <a href="ACL2____BIT-_E3BOOL.html">bit-&gt;bool</a> to the <a href="ACL2____BITOPS.html">bitops</a> library.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">centaur/bitops/contrib</span> directory contains additional lemmas.</p> 
 
 
 <h2>Other Changes</h2> 
 
 <p>(File interface/emacs/inf-acl2.el) One now gets a clear error, suggesting a 
 solution, when Emacs command <span class="v">meta-x run-acl2</span> cannot find an ACL2 
 executable.  Thanks to Scott Staley for helpful correspondence leading to this 
 fix.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____MAKE-FLAG.html">make-flag</a> tool now uses slightly faster, more robust hints.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____WITNESS-CP.html">witness-cp</a> clause processor has been made more flexible.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">clause-processors/unify-subst</span> and <span class="v">clause-processors/generalize</span> 
 books have been reworked to avoid nearly duplicate definitions.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEF-UNIVERSAL-EQUIV.html">def-universal-equiv</a> macro now takes an <span class="v">already-definedp</span> 
 option.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">demos/patterened-congruences.lisp</span> book has been improved.</p> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">centaur/misc/intern-debugging</span> book has been modified and 
 should now be generally unnecessary, thanks to CCL improvements which have 
 resolved the problems it was intended to warn about.</p> 
 
 <p>Something happened to profiling.lisp in r2423.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____DISASSEMBLE_42.html">disassemble$</a> now supports macro aliases.</p> 
 
 <p>Several ordinary files that were incorrectly marked as executable are now 
 properly non-executable.</p> 
 
 <p>The tau <span class="v">elementary-bounders</span> book has been extended with additional 
 lemmas about <a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> for powers of 2.</p> 
 
 
 
 <h2>Changes to ACL2(r) Books</h2> 
 
 <p>Many explicit function definitions have been replaced with constraints, in 
 order to make theorems about those functions more useful for functional 
 instantiation later.  For example, instead of insisting that <span class="v">(f+g)(x)</span> is 
 really equal to <span class="v">f(x) + g(x)</span>, this is now only required for valid values of 
 <span class="v">x</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The theory of integration is now updated to conform to the current version 
 of continuity and differentiability (which allows functions that are only 
 continuous or differentiable over a particular domain).</p> 
 
 <p>The concepts of continuity, differentiability, and integration now have both 
 non-standard and classical definitions.  These are shown to be equivalent for 
 classical functions without parameters.  Even when parameters are present, the 
 classical definitions can be used to take advantage of important theorems, such 
 as the intermediate-value theorem, mean-value theorem, fundamental theorem of 
 calculus, etc.</p>
