<p>Internal representation of the syntax of Verilog and SystemVerilog.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>A core component of <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> is its internal representation of Verilog's 
syntactic structures.  For each kind of Verilog construct (expressions, 
statements, declarations, instances, etc.) we introduce corresponding ``types'' 
with their own recognizer, constructor, and accessor functions.</p> 
 
<p>These structures generally correspond fairly closely to parse trees in the 
SystemVerilog grammar, except that:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We sometimes make certain <b>simplifications</b> to present a more regular 
view of the source code.  For instance, whereas in a normal Verilog module you 
might write something like <span class="v">wire [3:0] a, b, c;</span> to simultaneously declare 
several wires, our internal representation treats each wire declaration 
separately, as if you had instead written <span class="v">wire [3:0] a; wire [3:0] b; wire
[3:0] c;</span>.</li> 
 
<li>We generally <b>separate</b> the various kinds of parsed elements (e.g., 
assignments, declarations, etc.) out into distinct lists, whereas in the source 
code these elements may be all mixed together.  This is sometimes slightly 
tricky; see also the <a href="VL____LOADER.html">loader</a> and the <a href="VL____ANNOTATE.html">annotate</a> transform.</li> 
 
<li>Many structures also contain various <b>additional fields</b> that are not 
purely part of the syntax.  For instance, many structures include <a href="VL____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a> annotations to say where they came from, expressions include 
annotations about whether they have explicit parentheses, and high-level design 
elements like modules have <a href="VL____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> attached to them.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>We introduce all of these structures using the <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a> library and 
following the fixtype discipline.  This generally means that each type has an 
associated fixing function, equivalence relation, etc.  If you aren't familiar 
with fty, you may want to learn a bit about it before trying to understand 
these structures.</p> 
 
<h3>Quick Guide</h3> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog is a huge language (the grammar is about 45 pages!) so it can 
be easy to get lost in all of the different kinds of constructs.  Here is a 
quick guide to the most major syntactic definitions:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL____VL-DESIGN.html">vl-design</a> is our top-level representation of an <b>entire 
design</b>, including all of the modules, interfaces, packages, programs, etc., 
typically spread out across many Verilog or SystemVerilog source files.  If you 
start here and then drive down into the fields, you'll eventually explore all 
of our syntactic constructs.</li> 
 
<li>Many kinds of major <b>design elements</b> can occur in a design, e.g., 
modules, interfaces, packages, programs, configs, user defined primitives, etc. 
We represent these with, e.g., <a href="VL____VL-MODULE.html">vl-module</a>, <a href="VL____VL-INTERFACE.html">vl-interface</a>, <a href="VL____VL-PACKAGE.html">vl-package</a>, <a href="VL____VL-PROGRAM.html">vl-program</a>, <a href="VL____VL-CONFIG.html">vl-config</a>, <a href="VL____VL-UDP.html">vl-udp</a>, etc.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>Modules</b> are the mainstay of most designs.  Most modules contain 
things like assignments, gate and module instances, always blocks, initial 
blocks, aliases, and so on.  We represent these module elements using, e.g., 
<a href="VL____VL-ASSIGN.html">vl-assign</a>, <a href="VL____VL-GATEINST.html">vl-gateinst</a>, <a href="VL____VL-MODINST.html">vl-modinst</a>, <a href="VL____VL-ALWAYS.html">vl-always</a>, 
<a href="VL____VL-INITIAL.html">vl-initial</a>, <a href="VL____VL-FINAL.html">vl-final</a>, <a href="VL____VL-ALIAS.html">vl-alias</a>, etc.</li> 
 
<li>Other widely used constructs include <b>declarations</b> of many kinds, 
e.g., variables, ports, parameters, functions, tasks, types.  See for instance 
<a href="VL____VL-VARDECL.html">vl-vardecl</a>, <a href="VL____VL-PORT.html">vl-port</a> and <a href="VL____VL-PORTDECL.html">vl-portdecl</a>, <a href="VL____VL-PARAMDECL.html">vl-paramdecl</a>, 
<a href="VL____VL-FUNDECL.html">vl-fundecl</a>, <a href="VL____VL-TASKDECL.html">vl-taskdecl</a>, and <a href="VL____VL-TYPEDEF.html">vl-typedef</a>.</li> 
 
<li>Underpinning all of the above are <b><a href="VL____EXPRESSIONS-AND-DATATYPES.html">Expressions and Datatypes</a></b>.  These are 
mutually recursive since expressions like casts can include types while many 
datatypes use expressions for indexes and so forth.</li> 
 
<li>Various constructs like always/initial/final blocks and functions and tasks 
also make use of <b>procedural <a href="VL____STATEMENTS.html">statements</a></b> like if/else, case 
statements, and for loops.  Some notable statements include <a href="VL____VL-ASSERTSTMT.html">vl-assertstmt</a> and <a href="VL____VL-CASSERTSTMT.html">vl-cassertstmt</a> for immediate and concurrent 
SystemVerilog assertions.  Note that concurrent assertions also involve an 
elaborate notion of <a href="VL____PROPERTY-EXPRESSIONS.html">property-expressions</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>The above isn't entirely comprehensive; for instance a good deal of stuff is 
needed to represent generate statements; see <a href="VL____VL-GENELEMENT.html">vl-genelement</a>.  There are 
also various unfinished areas like support for SystemVerilog assertions.</p>
