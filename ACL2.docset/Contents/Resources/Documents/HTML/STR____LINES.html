<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=STR____LINES">Click for Lines in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Functions for operating on the lines of a string.</p><p>Note that these functions generally work with Unix-style newline 
characters, i.e., <span class="v">\n</span> instead of something like <span class="v">\r\n</span>.  Depending on 
your application, this may or may not be appropriate.</p> 
 
<p>One option for treating a string as lines is to just use, e.g., <a href="STR____STRTOK.html">strtok</a> to literally split it into a list of lines.  The functions here are 
generally meant to be more efficient, e.g., <a href="STR____PREFIX-LINES.html">prefix-lines</a> can add a 
prefix to every line without constructing an temporary string list or doing any 
intermediate string concatenation.</p>
