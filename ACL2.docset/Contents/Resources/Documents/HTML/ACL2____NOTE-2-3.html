<p>ACL2 Version  2.3 (October, 1998) Notes</p><p>Important changes:</p> 
 
 <p>Versions of ACL2 preceding this one contain a subtle soundness bug!  We 
 found a flaw in our detection of <a href="ACL2____SUBVERSIVE-RECURSIONS.html">subversive-recursions</a>.  The bug 
 allowed some subversive recursions to slip through undetected.</p> 
 
 <p>We believe it would have been difficult to have exploited this flaw 
 inadvertently.  In particular, the following five conditions are necessary. 
 <br> <br> 
 
 (1) Introduce a constrained function, say <span class="v">f</span>, via an <span class="v">encapsulate</span>. 
 <br> <br> 
 
 (2) In the same encapsulation, define a clique of mutually recursive 
 functions.  This clique must be non-<span class="v">local</span> and in <span class="v">:logic</span> mode. 
 <br> <br> 
 
 (3) In that mutually recursive clique, use the constrained function 
 <span class="v">f</span> (perhaps indirectly) so that the termination argument for the clique 
 depends on properties of the <i>witness</i> for <span class="v">f</span>.  Thus, <span class="v">f</span> or some 
 other function dependent upon <span class="v">f</span>, must be used in an argument in a 
 recursive call or in a term governing a recursive call.  Furthermore, the use 
 of <span class="v">f</span> must be such that the termination proof cannot be done without 
 exploiting properties of the witness for <span class="v">f</span>.  Other uses of the 
 constrained functions in the clique are ok.  <br> <br> 
 
 (4) Fail to include the exploited properties of <span class="v">f</span> among the constraints 
 of the encapsulation.  <br> <br> 
 
 (5) Later, outside the encapsulation, explicitly use a functional 
 instantiation in which <span class="v">f</span> is replaced by a function not enjoying the 
 crucial properties.  <br> <br> 
 
 See <a href="ACL2____SUBVERSIVE-RECURSIONS.html">subversive-recursions</a> for details.</p> 
 
 <p>Less important notes:</p> 
 
 <p>We have begun to write some introductory tutorial material for those who 
 wish to learn to program in ACL2.  Most of this material is HTML-based.  See 
 the Hyper-Card on the ACL2 home page.</p> 
 
 <p>The documentation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> was improved to explain why one 
 might wish to verify the ``guards'' of a <span class="v">defthm</span> event.  The missing 
 documentation was noticed by John Cowles.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug was fixed in cross fertilization.  The bug caused the system to 
 report that it had substituted one term for another when in fact no 
 substitution occurred.  The bug was noticed by Bill McCune.</p>
