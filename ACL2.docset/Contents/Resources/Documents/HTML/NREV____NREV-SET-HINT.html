<p>Set a candidate list to try and preserve existing conses when finishing an nrev.</p><div class="box"><p><b>Signature:</b> <span class="v">(<a href="NREV____NREV-SET-HINT.html">nrev-set-hint</a> a nrev)</span> â†’ 
<span class="v">nrev'</span></p></div> 
 
<p>In the common use case where an nrev is accumulating a transformed list (as 
in a <a href="STD____DEFPROJECTION.html">std::defprojection</a>), sometimes it may be the case that few of the 
list elements are actually transformed.  In these cases it may be desirable to 
return a list that has as many conses shared with the original list as 
possible.  This way, fewer total conses are in your working footprint.</p> 
 
<p>To support this, nrev allows setting a hint, which in such a case should 
just be the original, untransformed list.</p> 
 
<p>In the logical story, this doesn't do anything but return the unchanged 
nrev.  In the pure ACL2 implementation, it just sets an extra stobj field to 
the hint.  However, in the optimized implementation, when there is a hint set, 
then before returning the final list, we check to see if it has a suffix in 
common with the hint, and if so, replace that suffix with the one from the 
hint.  Therefore, we return something equal to the list we've accumulated, but 
with as many of the conses from the hint as possible.</p>
