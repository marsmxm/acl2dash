<p>ACL2 as an Interactive Theorem Prover</p><p>The ACL2 theorem prover finds proofs in the ACL2 logic.  It can be 
 automatic.  But most often the user must help it.</p> 
 
 <p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/interactive-theorem-prover.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <p>The user usually guides ACL2 by suggesting that it first prove key 
 <b>lemmas</b>.  Lemmas are just theorems used in the proofs of other 
 theorems.</p>
