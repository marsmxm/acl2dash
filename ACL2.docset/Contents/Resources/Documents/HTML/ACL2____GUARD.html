<p>Restricting the domain of a function</p><p>NOTE: Novices are often best served by avoiding guards.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 system provides a mechanism for restricting a function to a 
 particular domain.  Such restrictions are called ``guards.''  A definition's 
 guard has no effect on the logical axiom added when that definition is 
 accepted by ACL2.  Moreover, the guard has NO EFFECT on the proof that a 
 recursive definition is admissible â€” informally, that it terminates). 
 (See <a href="ACL2____MBT.html">mbt</a> for a discussion of one way to use the guard explicitly to 
 assist with that proof while avoiding execution overhead.)</p> 
 
 <p>Guards can be useful as a specification device or for increasing execution 
 efficiency.  To make such a restriction, use the <span class="v">:guard</span> keyword (see 
 <a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a>) or, especially if you want the host Lisp compiler to use this 
 information, use <span class="v">type</span> declarations (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>; also see <a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> for a discussion of the <span class="v">:split-types</span> keyword).  The general issue 
 of guards and guard verification is discussed in the topics listed below.</p> 
 
 <p>To begin further discussion of guards, see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-INTRODUCTION.html">guard-introduction</a>.  That 
 section directs the reader to further sections for more details.  To see just 
 a summary of some <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s related to guards, see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-QUICK-REFERENCE.html">guard-quick-reference</a>.  For a discussion of the use of proof to verify the 
 absence of guard violations, see <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>.</p>
