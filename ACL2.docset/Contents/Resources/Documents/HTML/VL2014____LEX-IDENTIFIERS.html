<p>Handling of identifiers.</p><p>The grammars of Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 agree on:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">identifier ::= simple_identifier
             | escaped_identifier

simple_identifier ::= [ a-zA-Z_ ] { [a-zA-Z0-9_$ ] }
  (no embedded spaces)</pre> 
 
<p>The Verilog-2005 grammar presents the rule for escaped identifiers as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">escaped_identifier ::= \ { any non-whitespace character } white_space</pre> 
 
<p>However, Section 3.7.1 of the Verilog-2005 standard appears to contradict 
the above definition.  It says that escaped identifiers "provide a means of 
including any of the <i>printable ASCII characters</i> in an identifier (the 
decimal values 33 through 126...).  Section 5.6.1 of the SystemVerilog-2012 
standard says the same thing, and its grammar has been updated with this 
clarification:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">escaped_identifier ::= \ { any printable non-whitespace character } white_space</pre> 
 
<p>We therefore restrict the name characters in escaped identifiers to the 
printable ASCII characters, i.e., characters whose codes are 33-126.</p> 
 
 
<p>Both Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog agree on the syntax for 
system identifiers:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">system_tf_identifier ::= $[ a-zA-Z0-9_$ ] { [ a-zA-Z0-9_$ ] }</pre> 
 
<p>Well, that's arguably true.  SystemVerilog adds certain pieces of syntax 
such as <span class="v">$</span> and <span class="v">$root</span> that overlap with <span class="v">system_tf_identifier</span>.  We 
generally turn these into special tokens; see <a href="VL2014____VL-LEX-SYSTEM-IDENTIFIER.html">vl-lex-system-identifier</a>. 
</p> 
 
 
<h5>Whitespace Minutia</h5> 
 
<p>Per Section 3.7.1 of Verilog-2005, the leading backslash character and the 
terminating whitespace character are not "considered to be part of the 
identifier", i.e., <span class="v">\cpu3</span> is treated the same as <span class="v">cpu3</span>.  Section 
5.6.1 of the SystemVerilog-2012 standard says the same thing.  Note that the 
Verilog grammar treats EOF as a whitespace, so we allow an escaped identifier 
to be closed with EOF -- there just isn't a whitespace character at the end of 
the PREFIX in that case.</p> 
 
<p>Perhaps a reason for including this whitespace is found on page 351 of the 
Verilog-2005 standard.  A macro with arguments is introduced like <span class="v">`define
max(a,b) ...</span> with no whitespace between its name (an identifier) and the 
first paren of the argument list.  So if you wanted to have an escaped 
identifier as the name of a macro with arguments, how would you know when the 
identifier ended and the argument list began?  Making the escaped identifier 
include a whitespace seems like a dirty trick to accomplish this.  In any 
event, we don't support macros with arguments anyway, but we go ahead and 
include the whitespace in case such support is ever added.</p> 
 
 
<h5>Empty Identifiers</h5> 
 
<p>I have not found anything in the spec which explicitly prohibits the empty 
escaped identifier, i.e., <span class="v">\&lt;whitespace&gt;</span>, from being used.  Nevertheless, 
I exclude it on the grounds that it is suspicious and Cadence does not permit 
it either.  Allowing it would make end-of-define even more complicated to 
properly support in the <a href="VL2014____PREPROCESSOR.html">preprocessor</a>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Notes about Honsing Identifiers</h3> 
 
<p>We are always careful to <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a> the names of the identifier tokens we 
create.  One reason it's a good idea is that identifiers are often repeated 
many times, so making the actual string part a hons lets us use only one copy 
of the string.  The other big reason is that identifier names are often used in 
fast-alist lookups, and if the string isn't a hons, then <a href="ACL2____HONS-GET.html">hons-get</a> will 
have to hons it first anyway.  So, by honsing as we create the identifier 
token, we potentially avoid a lot of repeated, redundant honsing later 
on.</p>
