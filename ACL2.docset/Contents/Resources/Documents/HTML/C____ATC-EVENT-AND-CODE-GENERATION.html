<p>Event generation and code generation performed by <span class="tt"><a href="C____ATC.html">atc</a></span>.</p><p>We generate C abstract syntax, 
     which we pretty-print to a file 
     and also assign to a named constant.</p><p>Given the restrictions on the target functions, 
     the translation is fairly straightforward -- intentionally so.</p><p>Some events are generated in two slightly different variants: 
     one that is local to the generated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, 
     and one that is exported from the  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>. 
     Proof hints are in the former but not in the latter, 
     thus keeping the ACL2 history ``clean''; 
     some proof hints may refer to events 
     that are generated only locally to the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>.</p>
