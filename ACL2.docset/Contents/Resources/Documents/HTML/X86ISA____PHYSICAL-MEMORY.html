<p>Physical memory read and write functions</p><p>Note that the top-level memory accessor function is <a href="X86ISA____RME08.html">rme08</a> and updater function is <a href="X86ISA____WME08.html">wme08</a>.  Their 16, 32, 64, and 
  128 bit counterparts are also available.  These functions behave 
  differently depending upon the value of 
  <span class="v">app-view</span>.</p> 
 
<p>The functions defined here, like <a href="X86ISA____RM-LOW-32.html">rm-low-32</a> and <a href="X86ISA____WM-LOW-32.html">wm-low-32</a>, are low-level read and write functions that access 
physical memory directly in the system-level view.  We do not 
recommend using these functions at the top-level.</p>
