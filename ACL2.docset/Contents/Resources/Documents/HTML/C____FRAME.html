<p>Fixtype of frames.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>function — <a href="C____IDENT.html">ident</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>scopes — <a href="C____SCOPE-LIST.html">scope-list</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><h5>Additional Requirements</h5><p>The following invariant is enforced on the fields:</p><pre class="code">(consp scopes)</pre><p>Every time a function is called, a frame is created, 
     which contains information about 
     the function and its variables' values.</p><p>The variables are organized into a stack (i.e. list) of scopes, 
     which grows leftward and shrinks rightward 
     (i.e. scopes are added via <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span> and removed via <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span>. 
     There is always at least one scope, 
     i.e. the one for the function body's block.</p><p>As defined later, the call stack is represented as 
     a stack (i.e. list) of frames.</p>
