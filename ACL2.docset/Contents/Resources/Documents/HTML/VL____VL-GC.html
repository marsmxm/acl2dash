<p>In the logic <span class="v">vl-gc</span> just returns <span class="v">nil</span>.  On CCL, its raw 
Lisp definition, it may (or may not) trigger a garbage collection.  On other 
Lisps, it just does nothing.</p> 
 
<p>Throughout VL, we call <span class="v">vl-gc</span> at "good" places to do garbage 
collection.  We typically call it right after computations that allocate a lot 
of "temporary" memory—memory that will be garbage once the computation 
has finished.  A GC at this time may be cheaper than a GC later, when we just 
happen to run out of memory, because GC costs are basically proportional to the 
number of live objects.</p> 
 
<p>Running <span class="v">vl-gc</span> only sometimes triggers a GC.  Why?  We sometimes use VL 
to process large designs (hundreds of thousands of lines of Verilog), and 
sometimes use it on much smaller designs.  Depending on the kind of input, we 
probably want to use different GC strategies:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>When we process large designs, each transformation naturally allocates more 
memory.  Some transforms might allocate hundreds of megabytes or gigabytes of 
memory.  In this case, we would like to GC more frequently in order to keep our 
memory usage down.</li> 
 
<li>When we deal with small designs, nothing is very expensive.  We probably 
have ample memory to process the whole design without any garbage collection. 
In this case, we would like to avoid GC altogether to maximize 
performance.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p><span class="v">vl-gc</span> is meant to work well with either scenario.  Basically, after 
triggering a GC, <span class="v">vl-gc</span> records how much memory are allocated.  This gives 
us a rough baseline of how much memory the rest of the program is using.  Then, 
each time <span class="v">vl-gc</span> is called, it compares the current memory usage to this 
baseline.  A GC is only triggered if the new memory usage exceeds the baseline 
by some threshold (e.g., 1 GB).</p> 
 
<p>Here's how this works under either scenario.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>When we process a large design, our transforms are consuming memory quite 
quickly, so the <span class="v">vl-gc</span> calls throughout our program end up causing many 
GCs.  These GCs occur at good places (the places where we called <span class="v">vl-gc</span>, 
and keep our memory usage down, as desired.</li> 
 
<li>When we process a small design, our transforms don't use much memory so 
when we call <span class="v">vl-gc</span>, we haven't exceeded the threshold.  So, we don't waste 
our time collecting this insignificant garbage, as desired.</li> 
 
</ul>
