<p>Generate markers to indicate sources of <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> proof obligations</p><p>ACL2 guard verification (see <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>) is often best avoided by 
 beginning users of ACL2.  When guard verification is employed, it can generate 
 numerous goals, some of which may not be theorems if the definition being 
 processed has bugs.  It can be difficult to find such bugs.  This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic explains a capability provided by ACL2 to help find such 
 bugs.</p> 
 
 <p>For a similar utility appropriate for proving <a href="ACL2____MEASURE.html">measure</a> conjectures 
 (that is, for termination proofs), see <a href="ACL2____MEASURE-DEBUG.html">measure-debug</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We begin with the following example.  Although it is contrived and a bit 
 simplistic, it illustrates how the guard-debug utility works.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> length-repeat (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x x)))
(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> length-repeat :guard-debug t)</pre> 
 
 <p>The output produces two top-level key checkpoints, as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Subgoal 2
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="ACL2____EXTRA-INFO.html">EXTRA-INFO</a> '(:GUARD (:BODY LENGTH-REPEAT))
                     '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> X X))
         (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">TRUE-LISTP</a> X))

Subgoal 1
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="ACL2____EXTRA-INFO.html">EXTRA-INFO</a> '(:GUARD (:BODY LENGTH-REPEAT))
                          '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">LENGTH</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> X X)))
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">TRUE-LISTP</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> X X))))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">STRINGP</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> X X)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The upper subgoal (numbered 2) says that the body of the definition of 
 <span class="v">length-repeat</span> contains a call <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> X X)</span>, which is the source of 
 the goal.  In this case, that makes sense: the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> for a call 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> arg1 arg2)</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> arg1)</span>, which in this case is 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">TRUE-LISTP</a> X)</span>.  The lower subgoal (numbered 1) says that the same 
 definition contains the call <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">LENGTH</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> X X))</span>, which generates the 
 proof obligation that if <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> X X)</span> does not satisfy <span class="v">true-listp</span>, 
 then it must satisfy <span class="v">stringp</span>.  That proof obligation comes directly from 
 the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Of course, the example above is a bit obvious.  But for large definitional 
 bodies such information can be very helpful.  Note that guard-debug can be 
 specified not only in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> events but also in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> forms of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> events.</p> 
 
 <p>We now describe the guard-debug utility in some detail.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EXTRA-INFO.html">Extra-info</a> x y)</span> always returns <span class="v">t</span> by definition.  However, if 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> verification takes place with a non-<span class="v">nil</span> setting of 
 <span class="v">guard-debug</span> (see below), then the goals generated for guard verification 
 can include hypotheses that are calls of <span class="v">extra-info</span>.  Typically, such a 
 hypothesis is of the following form:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____EXTRA-INFO.html">extra-info</a> '(:guard (:body F))
            '(<a href="ACL2____G.html">G</a> ARG1 ... ARGk))</pre> 
 
 <p>The above form indicates that the goal in which it occurs was generated to 
 verify that the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of the function <span class="v">F</span> is satisfied by the 
 arguments <span class="v">ARG1</span> through <span class="v">ARGk</span>, where the term <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____G.html">G</a> ARG1 ... ARGk)</span> 
 occurs in the body of the function <span class="v">F</span> whose guard verification is in 
 progress.  If however the above call of <span class="v">G</span> occurs in the guard of <span class="v">F</span> 
 instead of the body of <span class="v">F</span>, then <span class="v">:body</span> is replaced by <span class="v">:guard</span> 
 above:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____EXTRA-INFO.html">extra-info</a> '(:guard (:guard F))
            '(<a href="ACL2____G.html">G</a> ARG1 ... ARGk))</pre> 
 
 <p>If the same proof obligation (goal clause) arises from more than one 
 occurrence of the same call, then a single goal will be generated, which has 
 several <span class="v">extra-info</span> hypotheses added to show the multiple sources of that 
 proof obligation.</p> 
 
 <p>All rules (see <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>) associated with <span class="v">extra-info</span> are <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d by default, so that hypotheses of the form described above are not 
 simplified to <span class="v">t</span>.  These hypotheses are intended to ride along for free: 
 you can generally expect the proof to have the same structure whether or not 
 the <span class="v">:guard-debug</span> option is supplied, though on rare occasions the proofs 
 may diverge.</p> 
 
 <p>It remains to explain the notion of a <span class="v">guard-debug</span> setting of <span class="v">t</span>, 
 that is, to explain how to obtain the additional hypotheses described above. 
 If guards are being verified during processing of a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> event 
 (whether or not inside a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span>), then one specifies 
 <span class="v">:guard-debug t</span> in an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> declaration of a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> form; 
 see <a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a>.  If however the guard verification is on behalf of a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> call, whether for a definition or a theorem, then one specifies 
 the keyword argument <span class="v">:guard-debug t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____PRINT-GV.html">print-gv</a> for a utility for debugging guard violations, in 
 contrast to the above guard-debug mechanism, which is for debugging failed 
 proofs arising from guard verification.</p>
