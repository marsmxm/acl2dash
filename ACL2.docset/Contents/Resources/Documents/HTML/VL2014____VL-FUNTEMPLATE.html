<p>Function expansion templates, the intermediate representation of 
functions we use while inlining function calls.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name  <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>inputs  <a href="VL2014____VL-VARDECLLIST.html">vl-vardecllist</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>locals  <a href="VL2014____VL-VARDECLLIST.html">vl-vardecllist</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>out  <a href="VL2014____VL-VARDECL.html">vl-vardecl</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>assigns  <a href="VL2014____VL-ASSIGNLIST.html">vl-assignlist</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>For each of the module's functions, we generate a template that 
will allow us to expand calls of the function.  Each template has the same 
<span class="v">name</span> as the function, but all of its inputs and var declarations have been 
turned into net declarations (the <span class="v">inputs</span> and <span class="v">locals</span>, respectively), 
and we have added a net declaration for the function's return value (<span class="v">out</span>). 
The function's body is converted into <span class="v">assigns</span>, an ordinary <a href="VL2014____VL-ASSIGNLIST-P.html">vl-assignlist-p</a>, and we assume that these assignments are well-formed in the 
sense of <a href="VL2014____VL-FUN-ASSIGNORDER-OKP.html">vl-fun-assignorder-okp</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Why do we bother introducing these templates at all?  One nice thing about 
them is that there is a certain amount of "static" processing that needs to 
be done on each function declaration (e.g., we need to do well-formedness 
checking and extract its body into assignments) and it is somewhat efficient to 
do this processing once, in the creation of templates, rather than each time we 
want to expand a call of the function.</p> 
 
<p>But a more important reason is that it allows us to support functions that 
call other functions in a straightforward way.  BOZO: previously we claimed 
that ``in <span class="v">vl-flatten-funtemplates</span> we use our ordinary function-expansion 
code to expand any function calls within function templates, so that when we 
expand functions throughout the rest of the module we only need one pass.'' but 
that function no longer exists and Jared does not remember whether we changed 
how this worked.</p>
