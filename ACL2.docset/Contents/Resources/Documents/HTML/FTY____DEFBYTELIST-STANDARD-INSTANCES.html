<p>Standard fixtypes of 
          true lists of unsigned and signed bytes of various sizes, 
          with some accompanying theorems.</p><p>Here `standard' means that these all have uniform structure and naming. 
     They are unary counterparts of 
     <span class="v">(unsigned-byte-listp n ...)</span> and <span class="v">(signed-byte-listp n ...)</span>, 
     for various values of <span class="v">n</span>.</p><p>These are all generated via <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFBYTELIST.html">defbytelist</a></span>.</p><p>If standard (in the sense above) fixtypes 
     of true lists of unsigned or signed bytes of a certain size 
     are needed but are not among the ones defined here, 
     they can be added here.</p><p>These fixtypes are based on <a href="FTY____DEFBYTE-STANDARD-INSTANCES.html">the standard fixtypes 
                   of unsigned and signed bytes of various sizes</a> that correspond to the element types of the lists.</p>
