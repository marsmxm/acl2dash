<p>Messages that the bridge sends to the client program.</p><p>We send all output to the client in discrete <b>messages</b>.  The 
message format is very simple.  It is easy for a client to reliably parse, and 
doesn't require us to think about character encoding.  Informally, the format 
is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">type len[newline]
contents[newline]</pre> 
 
<p>To make this extremely clear: we first print the <span class="v">type</span>, then a space, 
then the <span class="v">len</span>, then a newline character, then the <span class="v">contents</span>, then 
another newline character.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">type</span> here is a label that describes what kind of message this is. 
It matches <span class="v">[A-Z][A-Z0-9_]*</span>.  That is, it starts with an uppercase 
alphabetic character, and then contains only uppercase alphabetic, numeric, and 
underscore characters.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">len</span> says how many characters are in <span class="v">contents</span>.  It matches 
<span class="v">[0-9]+</span>, i.e., it is a base-10 natural number.</p>
