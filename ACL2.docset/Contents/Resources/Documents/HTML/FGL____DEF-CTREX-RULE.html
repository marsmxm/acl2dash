<p>Define a rule that helps FGL derive term-level counterexamples from Boolean assignments.</p><p>This form defines an informal rule that FGL may use to help derive 
assignments for theorem variables from the Boolean assignments returned by SAT 
solvers.  During this process (see <a href="FGL____FGL-COUNTEREXAMPLES.html">fgl-counterexamples</a>), various FGL objects 
are assigned concrete values, and we use these values to derive further assignments.</p> 
 
<p>A counterexample rule tells how to derive a new assignment from some 
existing assignments.  An example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FGL____DEF-CTREX-RULE.html">def-ctrex-rule</a> intcar-intcdr-ctrex-elim
  :match ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (intcar x))
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (intcdr x)))
  :match-conds ((cdr-match cdr)
                (car-match car))
  :assign (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> cdr-match cdr (intcdr x)))
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> car-match car (intcar x))))
            (intcons car cdr))
  :assigned-var x
  :ruletype :elim)</pre> 
 
<p>The rule is stored under an arbitrary name, the first argument.  The rest of the arguments:</p> 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:match</span> gives a list of bindings <span class="v">(var expr)</span>.  When applying the 
rule, one or more of the <span class="v">expr</span> entries must be matched against an object 
with an existing assignment.  For example, to apply the above rule we must have 
an assignment of a value to some term matching <span class="v">(intcar x)</span>, <span class="v">(intcdr
x)</span>, or both.  These assignments may come from three origins -- 1. the term 
may be one that is assigned a Boolean variable in the Boolean variable 
database (see <a href="FGL____FGL-GETTING-BITS-FROM-OBJECTS.html">fgl-getting-bits-from-objects</a>); 2. the term may be contain 
no variables and thus be evaluated under the Boolean assignment; 3. the term 
may be given an assignment by applying other counterexample rules.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:assigned-var</span> and <span class="v">:assign</span> respectively give the term to be 
assigned the value and the value.  In the above case, the subterm <span class="v">x</span> from 
that matched expressions is assigned the value <span class="v">(intcons car cdr)</span>, where 
<span class="v">car</span> and <span class="v">cdr</span> are the values assigned for the respective expressions, 
if they were assigned.  If not, <span class="v">x</span> may have been tentatively assigned a 
value by a previous rule and its <span class="v">intcar</span> or <span class="v">intcdr</span> may be 
preserved.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:match-conds</span> provide variables that say whether a value was determined 
for the given variable.  In this case, <span class="v">cdr-match</span> will be true if 
<span class="v">(intcdr x)</span> (the binding of <span class="v">cdr</span> in the <span class="v">:match</span> field)) was 
successfully assigned a value.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:ruletype</span> may be <span class="v">:elim</span> or <span class="v">:property</span>, signifying how the rule 
is intended to be used.  An <span class="v">:elim</span> rule should be applied once when as many 
of the match expressions as possible have been assigned values; at that point, 
we apply the rule and compute the final value for the subexpression.  A 
<span class="v">:property</span> rule may be applied to several different matching expressions in 
order to compute a value for the same subexpression.</li> 
 
<li>An additional keyword <span class="v">:assign-cond</span> must (if provided) be a term, which 
will be evaluated in the same way as <span class="v">:assign</span>.  If it evaluates to a 
non-<span class="v">nil</span> value, then the value is assigned; if not, the rule does not 
provide an assignment.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>An example of a property rule:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FGL____DEF-CTREX-RULE.html">def-ctrex-rule</a> assoc-equal-ctrex-rule
  :match ((pair (<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a> k x)))
  :assign (<a href="ACL2____PUT-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">put-assoc-equal</a> k (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> pair) x)
  :assigned-var x
  :ruletype :property)</pre> 
 
<p>This is a suitable property rule, but not an elim rule, because it may match 
many assignments to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a> k x)</span> for different <span class="v">k</span> in order to 
compute a value for <span class="v">x</span>.</p>
