<p>Modify the nature of proof output</p><pre class="code">Examples:

:set-gag-mode t      ; enable gag-mode, suppressing most proof commentary
(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> t)     ; same as above
:set-gag-mode :goals ; same as above, but print names of goals when produced
:set-gag-mode nil    ; disable gag-mode

General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> val)
:set-gag-mode val</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">val</span> is one of <span class="v">t</span>, <span class="v">nil</span>, or <span class="v">:goals</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, gag-mode is enabled, set to <span class="v">:goals</span>.  To see the current 
 value of gag-mode, evaluate the form, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a>)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a>) ; evaluates to t, nil, or :goals</pre> 
 
 <p>The basic idea of gag-mode is to avoid much of the verbose output from the 
 theorem prover, leaving only output that is expected to be helpful.  The first 
 two forms below set gag-mode on, while the other turns it off; these may be 
 placed in your ACL2 customization file; see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION.html">ACL2-customization</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> :goals) ; (<a href="ACL2____DEFAULT.html">default</a>) avoid most prover output; show goal names
(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> t)      ; avoid most prover output; also, hide goal names
(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> nil)    ; allow prover output</pre> 
 
 <p>Gag-mode focuses attention on so-called ``key checkpoints''.  By default, a 
 checkpoint is a goal that cannot be simplified.  (Below we discuss how to 
 change this default.)  A key checkpoint is a checkpoint that is not descended 
 from another checkpoint.  (Technical point: ``descended'' signifies that both 
 goals are at the top level in the same forcing round, or are in the same proof 
 by induction.)  Successful ACL2 users generally focus their attention on key 
 checkpoints, or less often, induction schemes.  (To suppress or abbreviate 
 induction schemes in gag-mode, see <a href="ACL2____SET-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-evisc-tuple</a>, specifically, the 
 discussion of <span class="v">:GAG-MODE</span>.)  For a discussion of how to use ACL2 prover 
 output in an effective manner, see <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a>, and see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> for a more detailed tutorial.  In 
 gag-mode, a key checkpoint is only displayed when ACL2 is unable to make any 
 further progress on that goal or some descendant of it, other than with a 
 proof by induction.</p> 
 
 <p>Evaluation of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> t)</span> enters gag-mode, so that only key 
 checkpoints are printed.  Evaluation of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> :goals)</span> also enters 
 gag-mode, but will additionally cause the name of a goal to be printed as soon 
 as it is generated (by invoking <a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-CLAUSE-IDS.html">set-print-clause-ids</a>).  The <span class="v">:goals</span> 
 setting is the default, and is useful for cases in which the prover spends 
 very little of its time generating goals to be proved by induction, yet you 
 want to see that it is making progress.  For finer-grained feedback about the 
 simplifier's activity, see <a href="ACL2____DMR.html">dmr</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>An alternative to gag-mode is to use proof-trees; see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>. 
 With proof-trees it is not so important to avoid excessive prover output, 
 since the proof-tree display provides structure that makes it easy to monitor 
 proof attempts and navigate output for a proof that has failed or seems to be 
 failing.  Still, output can take time to print, so you may get better 
 performance with gag-mode.</p> 
 
 <p>The intention of gag-mode is to show you only the parts of a proof attempt 
 that are relevant for debugging a failure; additional output is generally more 
 likely to be distracting than truly helpful.  But on occasion you may want to 
 see the full proof output after an attempt made with gag-mode.  This can be 
 done provided proof output is not inhibited (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>) during the proof attempt; see <a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a> and see 
 <a href="ACL2____PSO_12.html">pso!</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>You may notice that gag-mode tends to print relatively little information 
 about goals pushed for proof by sub-induction â€” i.e., a proof of *i.j, 
 *i.j.k, etc.  That feature emphasizes that unsuccessful sub-inductions should 
 generally be avoided, not analyzed for ways to make them succeed.  Instead, 
 the key checkpoint that generated the goal pushed for this induction is more 
 appropriate to analyze.  In general, the ``higher level'' the checkpoint, the 
 more worthy it is of attention.  Thus, it might be helpful to look at the 
 top-level checkpoints before looking at those labeled ``Key checkpoints under 
 a top-level induction''.</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude with remarks for advanced users.</p> 
 
 <p>The notion of ``checkpoint'' can be modified by the user.  The default, as 
 discussed above, is for a checkpoint to be a goal that cannot be simplified. 
 Put differently, a checkpoint is acted on by one of the processes in the value 
 of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> checkpoint-processors)</span>; see <a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>.  Any or all of the 
 symbols <span class="v">eliminate-destructors-clause</span>, <span class="v">fertilize-clause</span>, 
 <span class="v">generalize-clause</span>, or <span class="v">eliminate-irrelevance-clause</span> can be removed 
 from this value in order that invocation of the corresponding proof process 
 does not cause its input goal to be labeled a checkpoint.  For example, if you 
 do not want destructor elimination to be treated differently from 
 simplification for purposes of labeling checkpoints, you can evaluate the 
 following form (see <a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a>):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> checkpoint-processors
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REMOVE.html">remove</a> 'eliminate-destructors-clause
                (<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> checkpoint-processors)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that the value of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> checkpoint-processors)</span> also affects the 
 proof tree display; see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE-DETAILS.html">proof-tree-details</a>.  End of Remark.)</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____SET-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-evisc-tuple</a>, in particular the discussion there of 
 <span class="v">:GAG-MODE</span>, for how to influence slightly just what is printed in 
 gag-mode.</p>
