<p>Guarantee that a metafunction or clause-processor returns a 
 well-formed answer</p><p>A <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span> is a keyword attribute available 
 in the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a></span> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span>.  By default, when a metafunction or clause processor is 
 applied, ACL2 checks that the output is well-formed (and does not contain 
 certain ``forbidden'' functions; see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-SKIP-META-TERMP-CHECKS.html">set-skip-meta-termp-checks</a></span>).  By 
 providing a <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span> when you store a <span class="v">:meta</span> or 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rule, you can cause ACL2 to skip these runtime 
 checks.</p> 
 
 <p>This is considered an advanced feature that requires that you prove certain 
 theorems; this is probably only worthwhile if your metafunctions or clause 
 processors produce very large terms.  Henceforth, we assume you are familiar 
 with metafunctions and clause processors.</p> 
 
 <p>This topic first exhibits a simple example of a well-formedness guarantee 
 for a metafunction.  This example is really an outline; a self-contained, 
 runnable example may be found in the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> in file 
 <span class="v">books/demos/meta-wf-guarantee-example.lisp</span>.  Then we describe the 
 acceptable values of the <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span> keyword of both the 
 <span class="v">:meta</span> and <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rule-classes.  Next we show the forms of 
 the theorems you must prove to provide such guarantees.  Finally, we discuss 
 the runtime effects of providing such guarantees.</p> 
 
 <h4>Example</h4> 
 
 <p>Suppose that <span class="v">fn</span> is a vanilla metafunction that rewrites terms with top 
 function symbol <span class="v">TARGET</span>, of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ARITY.html">arity</a></span> 1.  The event storing <span class="v">fn</span> as 
 a metafunction would normally be something like this: 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> fn-is-correct
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> x)
                (<a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a> a))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (evl x a)
                  (evl (fn x) a)))
  :rule-classes
  ((:meta :trigger-fns (TARGET))))</pre> 
 
 where <span class="v">evl</span> is an evaluator for all the function symbols known to <span class="v">fn</span>. 
 Suppose that to prove this theorem, <span class="v">evl</span> must be able to interpret the 
 symbols <span class="v">TARGET</span>, <span class="v">CONS</span>, and <span class="v">IF</span>.  While the metatheorem for 
 <span class="v">fn</span> establishes that <span class="v">fn</span> returns something with the same 
 ``meaning'' (under <span class="v">evl</span>) as its input, it does not answer the question: 
 does <span class="v">fn</span> return a well-formed term, all of whose function symbols are in 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode?  Given the above <span class="v">:rule-class</span>, whenever the 
 simplifier fires the <span class="v">:meta</span> rule <span class="v">fn-is-correct</span> by applying <span class="v">fn</span> to 
 a term, it checks that the value, <span class="v">val</span>, is well-formed, by evaluating 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERMP.html">logic-termp</a> val (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span>.  The function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERMP.html">logic-termp</a></span> checks 
 that its argument is a <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> all of whose function symbols are in 
 <span class="v">:logic</span> mode.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Function: </b>logic-termp</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> logic-termp (x wrld)
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (plist-worldp-with-formals wrld)))
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a> x wrld)
            (<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-FNSP.html">logic-fnsp</a> x wrld)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">logic-termp</span> check can be avoided if, before you store the rule 
 <span class="v">fn-is-correct</span>, you prove: 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> fn-is-well-formed
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERMP.html">logic-termp</a> x w)
                (<a href="ACL2____ARITIES-OKP.html">arities-okp</a> '((TARGET . 1)
                               (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> . 2)
                               (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">IF</a> . 3))
                             w))
           (<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERMP.html">logic-termp</a> (fn x) w))
  :rule-classes nil)</pre> 
 
 and then you store <span class="v">fn-is-correct</span> this way: 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> fn-is-correct
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> x)
                (<a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a> a))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (evl x a)
                  (evl (fn x) a)))
  :rule-classes
  ((:meta :trigger-fns (TARGET)
          :well-formedness-guarantee fn-is-well-formed)))</pre> 
 </p> 
 
 <h4>Acceptable Values</h4> 
 
 <p>Now we describe the values you may provide with the 
 <span class="v">:well-founded-guarantee</span> keyword of the <span class="v">:meta</span> and the 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rule-classes. 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms:
:well-formedness-guarantee thm-name1
:well-formedness-guarantee (thm-name1)
:well-formedness-guarantee (thm-name1 thm-name2)</pre> 
 
 where both <span class="v">thm-name1</span> and <span class="v">thm-name2</span> are the names of previously 
 proved ``well-formedness theorems'' (see the next section); furthermore, 
 <span class="v">thm-name1</span> must be about the metafunction or clause processor being 
 introduced, and <span class="v">thm-name2</span> must be about the hypothesis metafunction (if 
 any) associated with the metafunction.  For <span class="v">:meta</span> rules, all three forms 
 are accepted, but the last form is required if the <span class="v">:meta</span> rule involves a 
 hypothesis metafunction.  That is, to provide a 
 <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span> for a metatheorem with a hypothesis 
 metafunction, you must supply both <span class="v">thm-name1</span> and <span class="v">thm-name2</span>.  For 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rules, you must use the first form.</p> 
 
 <p>Each well-formedness theorem provides an ``arity alist'' that specifies the 
 assumed arities of the function symbols known to the metafunction or clause 
 processor.  The arities shown for the function symbols listed in that alist 
 must be the same as the arities of those functions in the actual ACL2 logical 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> current at the time the <span class="v">:meta</span> or <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> is 
 stored.  Moreover, the function symbols in that alist must all be in 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.</p> 
 
 <p>Furthermore, none of the function symbols in the arity alists should be 
 ``forbidden'' function symbols as explained in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-SKIP-META-TERMP-CHECKS.html">set-skip-meta-termp-checks</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>When the <span class="v">:meta</span> or <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rule is stored, notes are 
 made that will prevent the function symbols on the arity alists from becoming 
 untouchable (and thus forbidden).  See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The only way a function's arity or forbidden status can change, or that a 
 function can transition out of <span class="v">:logic</span> mode, is if the user has engaged in 
 redefinition or activated a trust tag to add or remove untouchables.  Thus, 
 the restrictions above are unimportant to most users.</p> 
 
 <h4>Well-Formedness Theorems</h4> 
 
 <p>Theorems must be proved to establish that metafunctions and clause 
 processors return well-formed results.  These are called ``well-formedness 
 theorems.''  Note: To say a theorem is a ``well-formedness theorem'' is a 
 remark about the shape of the formula, not its rule-class.  There is no 
 <span class="v">:well-formedness-theorem</span> rule-class and a well-formedness theorem may be 
 stored with any <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> that accept the syntax of the 
 formula or as <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> <span class="v">nil</span>.  Indeed, if one of your 
 metafunctions uses another function to produce a subterm of the metafunction's 
 answer, you might need to prove a well-formedness theorem for the sub-function 
 and make it a <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule.</p> 
 
 <p>Well-formedness theorems for metafunctions and clause processors are 
 similar but slightly different.  We deal with metafunctions and their 
 corresponding hypothesis metafunctions (if any) first.  The shapes of the 
 well-formedness theorems for a metafunction and hypothesis metafunction are 
 identical, but remember that you must prove a well-formedness theorem for both 
 the metafunction and the associated hypothesis metafunction.  So suppose 
 <span class="v">fn</span> is a metafunction or a hypothesis metafunction and let <span class="v">(fn x ...)</span> 
 be a legal call on distinct variable symbols.  (Recall that extended 
 metafunctions and their hypothesis functions can take three arguments.)  Then 
 the general form a well-formedness theorem for <span class="v">fn</span> states that <span class="v">fn</span> 
 returns a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a></span> when given one, provided the arities of certain 
 function symbols are as expected: 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form of Well-Formedness Theorem for a Metafunction:
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERMP.html">logic-termp</a> x w)
              (<a href="ACL2____ARITIES-OKP.html">arities-okp</a> '&lt;alist&gt; w))
         (<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERMP.html">logic-termp</a> (fn x ...) w))</pre> 
 
 where <span class="v">&lt;alist&gt;</span> is an alist pairing function symbols with their assumed 
 arities as illustrated in the opening example.  Note that the first argument 
 of <span class="v">arities-okp</span> in the theorem is a quoted constant.  You may omit or 
 reorder the hypotheses above and you may use different variable symbols in 
 place of <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">w</span>, but they must be distinct and different from the 
 variables in the ``<span class="v">...</span>.''</p> 
 
 <p>An example of <span class="v">&lt;alist&gt;</span> is <span class="v">((TARGET . 1) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> . 2) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">IF</a> . 3))</span>. 
 Generally, the <span class="v">&lt;alist&gt;</span> you provide should assign arities to every symbol 
 known to <span class="v">fn</span>, i.e., every function symbol known to the evaluator used in 
 your correctness theorem.  If you inspect the definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a></span> you 
 will see that it uses <span class="v">w</span> to obtain arities of the function symbols in 
 <span class="v">x</span>.  The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ARITIES-OKP.html">arities-okp</a></span> hypothesis restricts <span class="v">w</span> to worlds where 
 the function symbols known to <span class="v">fn</span> have the arities you expect and are in 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>-mode.  For example, given the <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ARITIES-OKP.html">arities-okp</a> '&lt;alist&gt;
 w)</span> hypothesis for the <span class="v">&lt;alist&gt;</span> above, the theorem prover will rewrite 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ARITY.html">arity</a> 'IF w)</span> to 3.  By default <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ARITY.html">arity</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ARITIES-OKP.html">arities-okp</a></span> are 
 disabled; and the following rewrite rules, which are part of ACL2's initial 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, will take care of calls like <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ARITY.html">arity</a> 'IF w)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGICP.html">logicp</a>
 fn w)</span>.</p>

 <p>Now we turn to the well-formedness theorem for a clause processor, 
 <span class="v">cl-proc</span>.  Let <span class="v">(cl-proc x ...)</span> be a legal call on distinct variable 
 symbols.  The theorem establishes that <span class="v">cl-proc</span> returns a list of clauses 
 when given a clause, provided certain functions have the expected arities. 
 But the recognizer for a clause is the function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERM-LISTP.html">logic-term-listp</a></span> and 
 the recognizer for a list of clauses is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERM-LIST-LISTP.html">logic-term-list-listp</a></span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms of Well-Formedness Theorem for a Clause Processor

 <p>The first form above is for a <span class="v">cl-proc</span> that returns a single value and 
 the second form is for a <span class="v">cl-proc</span> that returns multiple values.</p> 
 
 <p>The discussion about metafunctions, above, applies here as well. 
 <span class="v">&lt;Alist&gt;</span> is an alist pairing function symbols with their assumed arities. 
 You may omit or reorder the hypotheses and you may use different variable 
 symbols in place of <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">w</span>, but they must be distinct and different 
 from the variables in the ``<span class="v">...</span>.''</p> 
 
 <h4>Runtime Effects</h4> 
 
 <p>In the absence of a <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span>, if a metafunction or 
 clause processor is applied during a proof and produces <span class="v">val</span>, then certain 
 checks are made on <span class="v">val</span> before it is used in the proof attempt.  In the 
 case of a metafunction, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERMP.html">logic-termp</a> val (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span> is checked and 
 <span class="v">val</span> is scanned to ensure that it contains no forbidden function symbols. 
 In the case of a clause processor, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-TERM-LIST-LISTP.html">logic-term-list-listp</a> val (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span> 
 is checked and <span class="v">val</span> is scanned to ensure that it contains no forbidden 
 function symbols.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">val</span> is large (e.g., because the input is large), these checks can 
 take more time than the metafunction or clause processor did to produce 
 <span class="v">val</span>!  It is for this reason that we provide for 
 <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span>s.</p> 
 
 <p>When a <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span> is provided no checks are made on 
 <span class="v">val</span>.  However, ACL2 will check that the arity alist(s) involved in the 
 guarantee still correctly shows the arities of the function symbols listed. 
 Because those function symbols were not forbidden when the guarantee was made 
 and are prohibited from being forbidden thereafter, no check is necessary to 
 ensure that no forbidden symbols are introduced into the proof.</p>
