<p>The Montgomery form of the Jubjub curve [ZPS:A.2].</p><p>The <a href="ZCASH____JUBJUB.html">Jubjub curve</a> \mathbb{J} [ZPS:5.4.9.3] is a twisted Edwards curve. 
     However, because of the <a href="ECURVE____BIRATIONAL-MONTGOMERY-TWISTED-EDWARDS.html">birational equivalence between 
                     Montgomery and twisted Edwards curves</a>, there is also a Montgomery form of Jubjub 
     \mathbb{M} [ZPS:A.2]. 
     Here we define it, using our general mapping, 
     and show some properties of it. 
     This mapping uses a scaling factor, 
     which ensures that the resulting Montgomery B is 1.</p>
