<p>Utilities for numbered names.</p><p> 
   A <i>numbered name</i> is a symbol consisting of four parts, in this order: 
   </p> 
   <ol> 
     <li> 
     A non-empty <i>base</i> symbol. 
     </li> 
     <li> 
     A non-empty sequence of non-numeric characters 
     that marks the start of the numeric index, 
     separating it from the base name. 
     This character sequence is global but customizable. 
     </li> 
     <li> 
     One of the following: 
     <ul> 
       <li> 
       A non-empty sequence of numeric decimal digits not starting with 0, 
       that forms the <i>numeric index</i>, 
       which is a positive integer. 
       </li> 
       <li> 
       A non-empty sequence of non-numeric characters 
       that forms a <i>wildcard</i> for the numeric index. 
       This character sequence is global but customizable. 
       </li> 
     </ul> 
     </li> 
     <li> 
     A possibly empty sequence of non-numeric characters 
     that marks the end of the numeric index 
     and that, together with the character sequence in part 2 above, 
     surrounds the numeric index or the wildcard. 
     This character sequence is global but customizable. 
     </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p> 
   Examples of numbered names are: 
   </p> 
   <ul> 
     <li> 
     <span class="v">MUL2{14}</span>, where 
     <span class="v">MUL2</span> is the base name, 
     <span class="v">{</span> marks the start of the numeric index, 
     <span class="v">14</span> is the numeric index, and 
     <span class="v">}</span> marks the end of the numeric index. 
     </li> 
     <li> 
     <span class="v">SORT{*}</span>, where 
     <span class="v">SORT</span> is the base name, 
     <span class="v">{</span> marks the start of the numeric index (wildcard), 
     <span class="v">*</span> is the wildcard, and 
     <span class="v">}</span> marks the end of the numeric index (wildcard). 
     </li> 
     <li> 
     <span class="v">FIND$3</span>, where 
     <span class="v">FIND</span> is the base name, 
     <span class="v">$</span> marks the start of the numeric index, 
     <span class="v">3</span> is the numeric index, 
     and nothing marks the end of the numeric index. 
     </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> 
   Numbered names are useful, for instance, 
   to denote subsequent versions of functions 
   produced by sequences of transformations, 
   e.g. <span class="v">foo{1}</span>, <span class="v">foo{2}</span>, ... 
   </p>
