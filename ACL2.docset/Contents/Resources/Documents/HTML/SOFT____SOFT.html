<p>SOFT (Second-Order Functions and Theorems) 
          is a tool to mimic second-order functions and theorems 
          in the first-order logic of ACL2.</p><p>In SOFT, 
     second-order functions are mimicked 
     by first-order functions that depend on 
     explicitly designated uninterpreted functions 
     that mimic function variables. 
     First-order theorems over these second-order functions 
     mimic second-order theorems universally quantified over function variables. 
     Instances of second-order functions and theorems 
     are systematically generated 
     by replacing function variables with functions. 
     Theorem instances are proved automatically, 
     via automatically generated 
     <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION.html">functional 
     instantiations</a>.</p><p>SOFT does not extend the ACL2 logic. 
     It is a library that provides macros to introduce 
     function variables, 
     second-order functions, 
     second-order theorems, 
     and instances thereof. 
     The macros modify the ACL2 state 
     only by submitting sound and conservative events; 
     they cannot introduce unsoundness or inconsistency on their own.</p><p>The 
     <a href="http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/paper.cgi?ACL22015.3" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2-2015 Workshop paper on SOFT<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/paper.cgi?ACL22015.3"></nobr></a> 
     provides 
     an overview of the SOFT macros and some simple examples of their use, 
     a description of the use of SOFT in program refinement, 
     and a discussion of related and future work. 
     The presentation of the Workshop talk is available

     As SOFT is being extended and improved over time, 
     some of the contents of the paper and presentation are becoming outdated. 
     This manual provides up-to-date information about SOFT.

     and the contents of the Workshop paper and presentation
