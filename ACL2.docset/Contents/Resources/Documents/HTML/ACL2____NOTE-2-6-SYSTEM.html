<p>ACL2 Version  2.6 Notes on System-level Changes</p><p>We modified the tracking of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> events and the use 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> global <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> in order to avoid some soundness 
 issues.  For example, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> events buried in locally-included 
 books are now tracked.  The ``Essay on Skip-proofs'' in source file 
 <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span> gives several examples of dicey behavior that is no longer 
 supported.</p> 
 
 <p>We fixed a problem with some of the makefiles, so that recursive 
 invocations of `make' now use the version of `make' specified on the command 
 line.</p> 
 
 <p>Files were fixed to help non-Unix/Linux users with book certification. 
 Thanks to John Cowles for finding some problems and suggesting fixes to 
 <span class="v">books/certify-numbers.lisp</span>, <span class="v">books/arithmetic/certify.lsp</span>, and 
 <span class="v">books/cowles/certify.lsp</span>.  We thank Scott Burson for noticing and fixing 
 some other such problems.  Moreover, a bdd test was being ignored entirely in 
 Version 2.5; this problem has been fixed as well.</p> 
 
 <p>A minor change in system function save-acl2-in-allegro will allow this 
 function to continue to work in Allegro CL versions starting (someday) with 
 10.0.  Thanks to Art Flatau for suggesting such a fix.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">books/case-studies/</span> directory has been removed.  These books are 
 in support of the first (1998) ACL2 workshop, and are accessible via the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2 home page<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/"></nobr></a>.  Also, 
 the <span class="v">books/cli-misc</span> directory has been renamed <span class="v">books/misc</span>, and the 
 <span class="v">books/nqthm</span> directory has been removed.</p> 
 
 <p>The notion of ACL2 version has been slightly modified to catch unsoundness 
 due to implementation dependencies.  See <a href="ACL2____VERSION.html">version</a>.  Another change to 
 eliminate such unsoundness is that built-in symbols now have a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> of <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span>; formerly, this string was 
 <span class="v">"LISP"</span> for ACL2 images built on GCL.  See <a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a>. 
 At a low level, the (undocumented) constant <span class="v">*main-lisp-package-name*</span> is 
 now <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span>; before, it was <span class="v">"LISP"</span> for GCL.</p>
