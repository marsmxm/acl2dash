<p>The End of the Walking Tour</p><p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/sitting.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <p>This completes the Walking Tour.</p> 
 
 <p>We intend to document many other parts of the system this way, but we just 
 haven't gotten around to it.</p> 
 
 <p>To start the two tours over again from the beginning, click on the icons 
 below.  If you are really interested in learning how to use ACL2, we recommend 
 that you repeat each tour at least once more to explore branches of the tour 
 that you might have missed.</p> 
 
 <p>If you want to learn how to use the theorem prover, we now recommend that 
 you devote the time necessary to work your way through the extended 
 introduction to how to use the prover.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>This will explain how to interact with ACL2 and has some sample problems 
 for you to solve including some challenge proofs to make ACL2 find.</p> 
 
 <p>We hope you enjoy ACL2.  We do.</p>
