<p>Usage message for vl lint.</p><p><b>Value:</b></p><pre class="code">"
vl lint:  A linting tool for Verilog.  Scans your Verilog files for things
          that look like bugs (size mismatches, unused wires, etc.)

Example:  vl lint engine.v wrapper.v core.v \\
            --search ./simlibs \\
            --search ./baselibs

Usage:    vl lint [OPTIONS] file.v [file2.v ...]

Options:

    -h,--help             Show a brief usage message and exit.
    --readme              Show a more elaborate README and exit.
    -s,--search=DIR       Control the search path for finding modules.
                          You can give this switch multiple times, to
                          set up multiple search paths in priority
                          order.
    --searchext=EXT       Control the search extensions for finding
                          modules.  You can give this switch multiple
                          times.  By default we just look for files
                          named \"foo.v\" in the --search directories.
                          But if you have Verilog files with different
                          extensions, this won't work, so you can add
                          these extensions here.  EXT should not
                          include the period, e.g., use \"--searchext
                          vv\" to consider files like \"foo.vv\", etc.
    -I,--incdir=DIR       Control the list of directories for `include
                          files.  You can give this switch multiple
                          times.  By default, we look only in the
                          current directory.
    --topmod=MOD          Limit the scope of the report to MOD.  By
                          default we include all warnings for any
                          module we encounter.  But if you say
                          \"--topmod foo\", we suppress all warnings for
                          modules that foo does not depend on.  You can
                          give this switch multiple times, e.g.,
                          \"--topmod foo --topmod bar\" means: only show
                          warnings for foo, bar, and modules that they
                          depend on.
    -q,--quiet=MOD        Suppress all warnings that about MOD.  You
                          can give this switch multiple times, e.g.,
                          \"-q foo -q bar\" will hide the warnings about
                          modules foo and bar.
    -d,--drop=MOD         Delete MOD from the module hierarchy before
                          doing any linting at all.  This is a gross
                          (but effective) way to work through any bugs
                          in the linter that are triggered by certain
                          modules.  The dropped modules are removed
                          from the module list without destroying
                          modules above them.  This may occasionally
                          lead to false warnings about the modules
                          above (e.g., it may think some wires are
                          unused, because the module that uses them has
                          been removed.)
    -i,--ignore=TYPE      Ignore warnings of this TYPE.  For instance,
                          \"--ignore oddexpr\" will suppress
                          VL_WARN_ODDEXPR warnings.  Note that there
                          are much finer-grained ways to suppress
                          warnings; see \"vl lint --readme\" for more
                          information.
    --cclimit=N           Limit for the const check.  This is a beta
                          feature that is not yet released.  Setting N
                          to 0 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a> default) disables the check.
                          Otherwise, limit the scope of the check to at
                          most N sub-expressions.
    --edition=EDITION     Which edition of the Verilog standard to
                          implement?  Default: \"SystemVerilog\" (IEEE
                          1800-2012).  You can alternately use
                          \"Verilog\" for IEEE 1364-2005, i.e.,
                          Verilog-2005.
    --strict              Disable VL extensions to Verilog.
    -m,--mem=GB           How much memory to try to use.  Default: 4
                          GB.  Raising this may improve performance by
                          avoiding garbage collection.  To avoid
                          swapping, keep this below (physical_memory -
                          2 GB).
    --debug               Print extra information for debugging.
