<p>A reader and parser for satisfiability instances stored in the DIMACS 
  SAT format.</p><h2>Background and Description</h2> 
 
<p>Satisfiability (SAT) instances are typically stored on disk in a format 
called the DIMACS SAT/CNF format.  The name DIMACS comes from the Rutgers 
University research group Center for Discrete Mathematics and Theoretical 
Computer Science (DIMACS).  The DIMACS group hosted several challenges in the 
1990s on algorithms and implementations related to graphs and other NP hard 
problems (<a href="http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/" target="_blank"><nobr> 
http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/Challenges/"></nobr></a>).  In 1992, the Second DIMACS 
Implementation Challenge included problems on graph cliques, graph coloring, 
and satisfiability.  The original DIMACS format for satisfiablity problems 
comes from this challenge, although it's hard to find evidence of this 
today.  (In fact, there used to be a document online describing the format used 
in this challenge, but that has since been removed.  It's quite difficult to 
find any mention of the format or challenge in the literature either.  This 
makes the reason behind the <i>DIMACS</i> part of the satisfiability format 
somewhat mysterious.)</p> 
 
<p>The SAT community has since taken ownership of this format and uses versions 
of it for SAT competitions.  The format seems to change at times, but is always 
based around the DIMACS CNF format.  Recent competitions use the definition 
from the 2009 SAT Competition (<a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html" target="_blank"><nobr>

specification is far from complete, however, and it is unfortunate there is no 
research paper that defines and evaluates a SAT problem specification.</p> 
 
<p>Here, we define a reader and parser for files in the DIMACS SAT format.  The 
general strategy will be to read the entire file into a list of bytes.  This 
list will be interpreted as a list of integers (but this could be changed to a 
list of bytes or list of signed bytes, etc.).  We then parse this list into 
either a list of clauses (which are lists of integers) or a flat list of 
integers (where clauses are separated by zeroes).  If the parsing fails, an 
error string is generated.  This string contains a call stack of sorts, so the 
offending part of the file can be located.  If the string is empty, then 
parsing succeeded.</p>

<h2>Format Specification</h2> 
 
Here, we define, in English, our interpretation of the most common 
specification for the DIMACS CNF format.  A DIMACS CNF file is divided into two 
sections: the preamble and the clauses section. 
 
The preamble is divided into two subsections: the comment section and the 
problem line.  The comment section is optional and comes before the problem 
line, if it exists.  The comment section is composed of comment lines where 
each comment line begins with the prefix <span class="tt">c </span> (that is, the character 
<span class="tt">c</span> followed by a space).  There is no whitespace before the prefix. 
 
The problem line is the second part of the preamble and is mandatory.  The 
problem line begins with the prefix <span class="tt">p </span> (the character <span class="tt">p</span> followed by a 
space).  (As an aside, the <span class="tt">p</span> is short for <i>problem</i>.)  Again, there is no 
whitespace before the prefix.  This prefix is followed by the string <span class="tt">cnf </span> 
indicating the problem is in the conjunctive normal form (CNF) format. 
(There are other formats from the DIMACS group with other problem identifiers.) 
The problem line then contains a positive integer indicating the highest 
variable used in the formula.  Finally, the problem line ends in a positive 
integer indicating the number of clauses in the formula.  An example problem 
line looks like <span class="tt">p cnf 4 8</span> which indicated the CNF formula described in 
the clauses section uses a maximum of 4 variables and contains exactly 8 
clauses. 
 
The clauses section immediately follows the problem line and occupies the 
remainder of the file.  A CNF formula consists of a conjunction of clauses 
which are disjunctions of literals.  The ANDs and ORs of the formula are 
implicit in the DIMACS CNF representation.  The clauses section is a series of 
integers separated by any amount of whitespace including spaces, tabs, and 
newlines.  Zero is a special integer that indicates the end of a clause.  Each 
clause consists of literals, indicated by positive and negative integers, 
followed by a zero.  The absolute value of any integer indicates the variable. 
Positive integers indicate the positive literal and negative integers indicate 
the negative literal, which is the negation of the associated variable.  An 
example clause in the DIMACS CNF format is <span class="tt">1 -2 -3 0</span> which represents 
the logical clause <span class="tt">x_1 OR NOT x_2 OR NOT x_3</span>. 
 
Furthermore, variables cannot exceed the maximum variable provided on the 
problem line, and the number of clauses in the clauses section must be exactly 
the number provided on the problem line.  Both literals and variables must be 
unique in each clause.  Clauses must be unique sets in the formula: no two 
clauses may be permuatations of each other.  The empty clause is 
permissable (but makes the formula trivially unsatisfiable when 
present).  (None of these features are checked in the parser below.  They would 
require a formula validator and hashing mechanism to examine the formula 
during/after parsing.) 
 
 
<h2>Specification Issues</h2> 
 
There are several inconsistencies in documented DIMACS CNF specifications.  It 
would be nice to support each of these variations with parser options. 
 
In most representations, the comments subsection is limited to the beginning of 
the file.  However, some specifications allow for comments to be interspersed 
throughout the clauses sections.  This encourages organizational descriptions 
of sets of clauses. 
 
Usually, the components of a problem line are separated by one space.  However, 
some specifications allow for multiple spaces (but not newlines) inside the 
problem line. 
 
The maximum variable in the problem line exists to indicate the amount of space 
to allocate in a solver.  This can be quite inefficient for benchmarks where 
many variables are unused in the formula.  These types of benchmarks exist 
because some encoding schemes might not be compact.  Some specifications 
require each variable from 1 to the maximum variable appear in the clauses 
section.  One application of this parser might be to report unused variables or 
condense a formula that skips certain variable numberings. 
 
Some specifications require that each clause occupy a single line of the file. 
That is, every clause-terminating zero should be followed by a newline and the 
whitespace separating literals cannot contain newlines.  This makes parsing a 
bit easier and makes the file easier to debug.  This requirement is probably 
the most common difference between DIMACS CNF specifications. 
 
While the most common specification disallows tautologies (clauses that contain 
both a literal and its negation), many specifications allow these clauses. 
 
Duplicate literals within a single clause could be allowed, but it seems like a 
poor idea. 
 
Some specifications disallow the empty clause (a clause with no literals before 
the terminating zero). 
 
A specification could allow the number of clauses in the clauses section to be 
different from number listed on the problem line. 
 
 
<h2>Future Specifications</h2> 
 
Donald Knuth proposes a new format/specification for satisfiability instances 
in his new volume of The Art of Computer Programming 
(<a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html" target="_blank"><nobr> 
http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~uno/taocp.html"></nobr></a>).  The DIMACS format is 
not very human-friendly.  Knuth's <span class="tt">SAT</span> format allows for human-readable 
formulas.  In this format, variables can be strings of (up to eight?) ASCII 
characters, negation is represented by a tilde character (~), whitespace is 
limited to one space character, clauses are limited to one per line, and 
clauses are not zero-terminated.
