<p>Restrictions to follow for naming books, directories, and other 
files.</p><h4>Recommendations</h4> 
 
<ol> 
 
<li>All file names and directory should use strictly lower-case, printable 
ASCII letters.</li> 
 
<li>Spaces and odd punctuation characters (e.g., beyond dash, underscore, and 
period) should not be used.</li> 
 
<li>Dashes should generally be preferred over underscores.</li> 
 
</ol> 
 
<h4>Rationale</h4> 
 
<p>These name restrictions encourage portability across different operating 
systems, file systems, etc.  (Some file systems restrict certain characters, or 
differ from one another with respect to case sensitivity.)</p> 
 
<p>Avoiding file names with spaces and special characters helps to makes it 
easier to write scripts or to write quick, one-off shell commands to process 
the books without worrying overly much about escaping.</p>
