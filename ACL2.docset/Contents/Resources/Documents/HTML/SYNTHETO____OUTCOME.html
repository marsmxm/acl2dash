<p>Each type of top-level definition, when submitted to ACL2, 
       will be accepted or rejected.  The success or failure 
       of the submission is modeled by an outcome, which is returned 
       to the submitter.</p><p>A function or clique of mutually-recursive functions, when 
       submitted successfully to ACL2, is represented by <span class="v">function-success</span>. 
       Similarly, a type definition or clique of mutually-recursive type 
       definitions is represented by <span class="v">type-success</span>.  Specifications, 
       theorems, and transformations also have success types.</p><p>Since a successful transformation results in new submitted top-level 
       definitions, those are returned as part of the success outcome.</p><p>For submission of a top-level definition to be accepted, 
       there are certain implicit proof obligations such as termination and 
       guard verification.  If one of these fails, a 
       <span class="v">proof-obligation-failure</span> outcome is returned, containing 
       an expression that could not be proved. This failure may result for a 
       number of different reasons, and may result from a number of different 
       top-level constructs including failure to prove the applicability 
       condition of a transformation.</p><p>If a theorem is submitted that is not mechanically proved by ACL2, 
       a <span class="v">theorem-failure</span> outcome is returned.</p><p>If a transformation is submitted that is applicable, but fails 
       due to some other reason, potentially a <span class="v">transformation-failure</span> 
       outcome is returned.</p><p>Any other submission failure results in a <span class="v">unexpected-failure</span> 
       outcome, which might have been expected but is at least not otherwise 
       classified.</p>
