<p>Implementation details of <a href="STR____BASE64.html">base64</a> encoding/decoding.</p><p>These routines should generally not be used directly, and may be 
changed in future versions of the library.</p> 
 
<p>Here are some naming conventions used throughout these functions:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<b>chars</b> refer to actual <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">ACL2::characters</a>, which typically will 
be in the Base64 alphabet, i.e., <span class="v">A-Z</span>, <span class="v">a-z</span>, <span class="v">0-9</span>, <span class="v">+</span>, and 
<span class="v">/</span>.  Of course, when decoding, data might be coming from some external 
source; it might contain pad characters <span class="v">=</span> or even arbitrary, invalid 
characters from beyond the Base64 alphabet.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>codes</b> refer to actual <a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-CODE.html">char-code</a>s, with the usual 
correspondence to <i>chars</i>.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>values</b> refer to the interpretation of each Base64 character as a 
numeric value.  For instance, the value of <span class="v">#\A</span> is 0; the value of <span class="v">#\B</span> 
is 1, and so on.  In our representation, the values are exactly the 64 natural 
numbers from 0-63, and can be recognized with, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 6
val)</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>bytes</b> refer to ordinary 8-bit bytes, which typically will be part of 
the original, un-encoded data.</li> 
 
</ul>
