<p>A safe mechanism for implementing something like <span class="v">nreverse</span>, for 
writing tail-recursive functions that use less memory by avoiding the final 
<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> step.</p><h3>Motivation</h3> 
 
<p>To avoid stack overflows, you sometimes need tail-recursive executable 
versions of your functions.  These tail-recursive functions often produce their 
elements in the reverse of the desired order.  For instance, here is a basic, 
tail-recursive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)" target="_blank"><nobr>map<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_(higher-order_function)"></nobr></a>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> map-exec (x acc)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> x)
      acc
    (map-exec (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="NREV____F.html">f</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)) acc))))</pre> 
 
<p>But this produces elements in the wrong order.  To correct for this, you 
might explicitly reverse the elements, e.g.,:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> map (x)
  (<a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a> :logic (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> x)
                  nil
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="NREV____F.html">f</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)) (map (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))))
       :exec (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> (map-exec x nil))))</pre> 
 
<p>This successfully avoids stack overflows, but since <a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> is 
applicative, this approach allocates twice as many conses as the naive, non 
tail-recursive version.</p> 
 
<p>In Common Lisp, we could avoid this overhead using <span class="v">nreverse</span>, a 
destructive routine that can reverse a list in-place by swapping pointers.  But 
since <span class="v">nreverse</span> is destructive, it wouldn't be sound to just make it 
generally available in ACL2.</p> 
 
<p>Even so, we would like to have something like <span class="v">nreverse</span> that would allow 
us to write tail-recursive versions of <span class="v">map</span> without having to allocate 
double the conses.  In principle, it is okay to use <span class="v">nreverse</span> here because 
we are only tampering with fresh conses that are not reachable from anywhere 
else in the program.  (Well, that's almost true; if <span class="v">map-exec</span> were <a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a>d, then we could get into trouble.)</p> 
 
<h3>Solution</h3> 
 
<p><span class="v">nrev</span> is, we believe, a safe mechanism for writing tail-recursive 
functions that can (at your option) avoid this double consing by using 
destructive, under-the-hood operations.</p> 
 
<p>Without trust tags, <span class="v">nrev</span> is roughly on par with the ordinary 
<span class="v">reverse</span> based solution:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Memory — same as <span class="v">reverse</span>, i.e., still twice as many as the non 
tail-recursive version.</li> 
 
<li>Runtime — perhaps around 1.3x worse than <span class="v">reverse</span> due to the 
<a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">ACL2::stobj</a> overhead.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>With a trust tag, <span class="v">nrev</span> is roughly on par with the <span class="v">nreverse</span> 
solution:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Memory — same as <span class="v">nreverse</span>, i.e., avoids the double consing 
problem.</li> 
 
<li>Runtime — perhaps around 1.25x worse than <span class="v">nreverse</span> due to the 
<a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">ACL2::stobj</a> overhead, but still faster than a traditional <span class="v">reverse</span> 
based solution.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h3>Loading <span class="v">nrev</span>
</h3> 
 
<p>For the pure ACL2 (no trust tags) version, you can use:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/nrev/pure" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>For the optimized (trust tags) version, you can instead load:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/nrev/fast" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>Note that it's perfectly fine to start with the pure book and then load the 
fast version later.  Loading the fast version will "retroactively" optimize 
all functions that are based on <span class="v">nrev</span>.</p> 
 
<h3>Using <span class="v">nrev</span>
</h3> 
 
<p>These books implement an abstract stobj called <span class="v">nrev</span>.  The logical story 
is that <span class="v">nrev</span> is just a list.  The fundamental operation on <span class="v">nrev</span> is 
<a href="ACL2____NREV-PUSH.html">nrev-push</a>, which logically conses "onto the right," like <a href="ACL2____RCONS.html">rcons</a>. 
Once you have pushed the desired elements, you can get them back out in queue 
order using <a href="ACL2____NREV-FINISH.html">nrev-finish</a>.</p>
