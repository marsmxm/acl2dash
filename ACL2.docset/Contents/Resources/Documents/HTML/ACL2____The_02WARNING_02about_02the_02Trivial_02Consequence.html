<p>The WARNING about the Trivial Consequence</p><p>This <b>Warning</b> alerts us to the fact that when treated as a 
 <b>rewrite</b> rule, the new rule <span class="v">TRIVIAL-CONSEQUENCE</span>, rewrites terms of 
 the same form as a rule we have already proved, namely 
 <span class="v">ASSOCIATIVITY-OF-APP</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>When you see this warning you should <b>think about your rules</b>!</p> 
 
 <p>In the current case, it would be a good idea <b>not</b> to make 
 <span class="v">TRIVIAL-CONSEQUENCE</span> a rule at all.  We could do this with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> nil.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 proceeds to try to prove the theorem, even though it printed some 
 warnings.  The basic assumption in ACL2 is that the <b>user</b> <b>understands 
 what he or she is doing</b> but may need a little reminding just to manage a 
 complicated set of facts.</p>
