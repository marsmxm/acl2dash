<p>An introductory guide, recommended for new users of <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a>.</p><p>This is a tutorial introduction to using GL to prove ACL2 theorems. 
We recommend going through the entire tutorial before beginning to use GL.</p> 
 
<p>You can think of this tutorial as a quick-start guide.  By the time you're 
done with it, you should have a good understanding of how GL works, and be able 
to use GL to easily prove many theorems.</p> 
 
<p>We don't try to cover more advanced topics, like <a href="GL____OPTIMIZATION.html">optimization</a> and 
<a href="GL____TERM-LEVEL-REASONING.html">term-level-reasoning</a>.  You'll probably want to get some practice using 
GL before exploring these topics.</p>
