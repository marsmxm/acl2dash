<p>A basic theory of algebra for all <a href="ACL2____ACL2-NUMBERP.html">ACL2-numberp</a>s.</p><p>The ACL2-NUMBERP-ALGEBRA theory is designed to be a simple, compact basis 
  for building other theories.  This theory contains a minimal set of rules 
  for basic algebraic manipulation including associativity and commutativity, 
  simplification, cancellation, and normalization.  It is extended by the 
  theories RATIONALP-ALGEBRA and INTEGERP-ALGEBRA to include selected linear 
  rules and rules for integers respectively.  This theory also contains the 
  DEFUN-THEORY (which see) of all built-in function symbols that would 
  normally occur during reasoning about the ACL2-NUMBERPs.</p> 
 
  <p>We used keep this theory (and book) separate but roughly equal to the 
  books maintained by Matt K. in order to have a solid, simple, and predictable 
  foundation on which to build the rest of the books in the IHS hierarchy. 
  However it was decided that this was too much trouble and we just select the 
  rules of Matt K. that we want.</p>
