<p>Where we look for translation data.</p><p>The VL server looks in a particular root directory for its 
translation data.  This directory should contain <span class="v">.vlzip</span> files created by 
the <span class="v">vl zip</span> command.  See the <a href="VL____KIT.html">kit</a> for more details.  Each 
<span class="v">.vlzip</span> file knows its name and has a date stamp associated with it.  We 
occasionally rescan this directory to look for new translations.</p>
