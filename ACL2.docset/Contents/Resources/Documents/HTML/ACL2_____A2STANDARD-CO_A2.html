<p>The ACL2 analogue of CLTL's <span class="v">*standard-output*</span></p><p>The value of the ACL2 constant <span class="v">*standard-co*</span> is an open 
 character output channel that is synonymous to Common Lisp's 
 <span class="v">*standard-output*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 character output to <span class="v">*standard-co*</span> will go to the stream named by 
 Common Lisp's <span class="v">*standard-output*</span>.  That is, by changing the setting of 
 <span class="v">*standard-output*</span> in raw Common Lisp you can change the actual 
 destination of ACL2 output on the channel named by <span class="v">*standard-co*</span>. 
 Observe that this happens without changing the logical value of 
 <span class="v">*standard-co*</span> (which is some channel symbol).  Changing the setting of 
 <span class="v">*standard-output*</span> in raw Common Lisp essentially just changes the map 
 that relates ACL2 to the physical world of terminals, files, etc.</p> 
 
 <p>To see the value of this observation, consider the following.  Suppose you 
 write an ACL2 function which does character output to the constant channel 
 <span class="v">*standard-co*</span>.  During testing you see that the output actually goes to 
 your terminal.  Can you use the function to output to a file?  Yes, if you are 
 willing to do a little work in raw Common Lisp: open a stream to the file in 
 question, set <span class="v">*standard-output*</span> to that stream, call your ACL2 function, 
 and then close the stream and restore <span class="v">*standard-output*</span> to its nominal 
 value.  Similar observations can be made about the two ACL2 input channels, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2STANDARD-OI_A2.html">*standard-oi*</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2STANDARD-CI_A2.html">*standard-ci*</a></span>, which are analogues of 
 <span class="v">*standard-input*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Another reason you might have for wanting to change the actual streams 
 associated with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2STANDARD-OI_A2.html">*standard-oi*</a></span> and <span class="v">*standard-co*</span> is to drive the 
 ACL2 top-level loop, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>, on alternative input and output streams. 
 This end can be accomplished easily within ACL2 by either calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> 
 on the desired channels or file names or by resetting the ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> 
 global variables <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a></span> and <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-CO.html">standard-co</a></span> which 
 are used by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>.  See <a href="ACL2____STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a> and see <a href="ACL2____STANDARD-CO.html">standard-co</a>.</p>
