<p>Keys are derived from wire names and are the basis of our skip 
          detection.</p><p><span class="tt">(sd-key-p x)</span> is a <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">defaggregate</a> of the following fields.</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="tt">pat</span>  The same as the wire name except that some embedded number (perhaps 
         spanning many digits) may have been replaced by a <span class="v">*</span> character.<br><font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a> pat)</span>.</font>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">index</span>  The parsed value of the number that has been replaced, or <span class="v">nil</span> 
           if no replacement was made.<br><font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAYBE-NATP.html">maybe-natp</a> index)</span>.</font>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">orig</span>  The original wire name.  This is somewhat unnecessary since it can be 
          recovered by just replacing <span class="v">*</span> in <span class="v">pat</span> with the characters 
          for <span class="v">index</span>, but we thought it was convenient to keep around.<br><font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a> orig)</span>.</font>
</li> 
</ul><p>Source link: sd-key-p</p><p>The idea of keys is to cause related signals to have the same 
pattern.  For instance, <span class="v">bcWCB0Ent_P</span> and <span class="v">bcWCB1Ent_P</span> will both give 
rise to the pattern <span class="v">bcWCB*Ent_P</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Because a particular wire name might include many numbers, we may generate a 
list of keys for a single wire.  For instance, for <span class="v">bcL2RB1NoRtry_P</span> we will 
generate one key with the pattern <span class="v">bcL*RB1NoRtry_P</span> and another with the 
pattern <span class="v">bcL2RB*NoRtry_P</span>.  We had previously considered using a list of 
indices, but found it easier to just generate multiple keys, each with a single 
index.</p>
