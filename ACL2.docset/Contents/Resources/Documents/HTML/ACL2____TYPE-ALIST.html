<p>An ACL2 representation of contextual knowledge</p><p>The ACL2 prover maintains many structures that need not be 
  understood by the user.  One of these, the <i>type-alist</i> structure, is 
  usually in this category.  But some utilities refer to the type-alist, so we 
  summarize it here.</p> 
 
  <p>A type-alist is an association list, each element of which is of the form 
  <span class="tt">(u ts . ttree)</span>, where <span class="v">u</span> is a <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> (in internal, 
  ``translated'' form), <span class="v">ts</span> is a <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a>, and <span class="v">ttree</span> is a 
  tag-tree (see <a href="ACL2____TTREE.html">ttree</a>).  Such an element means that the term <span class="v">u</span> has 
  the type-set <span class="v">ts</span>, which is a number.  While you are welcome to see the 
  <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> of <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> for details, this is not necessary, 
  since user-level utilities generally display a type-alist without displaying 
  numeric type-sets.  Instead, they often use a symbol of the form 
  <span class="tt">*TS-typ*</span> to denote the type described by <span class="tt">typ</span>, and for 
  complements they use <span class="tt">(TS-COMPLEMENT *TS-typ*)</span>.  For example, a 
  context in which the terms <span class="tt">(p x y)</span>, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NO-DUPLICATESP-EQUAL.html">no-duplicatesp-equal</a> y)</span>, 
  and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> x)</span> are assumed to be true (i.e., non-<span class="v">nil</span>) may be 
  displayed using the following lines.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">-----
Terms with type *TS-T*:
(<a href="ACL2____NO-DUPLICATESP-EQUAL.html">NO-DUPLICATESP-EQUAL</a> Y)
-----
Terms with type (TS-COMPLEMENT *TS-NIL*):
(P X Y)
-----
Terms with type *TS-NON-NEGATIVE-INTEGER*:
X
-----</pre> 
 
  <p>These lines says that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NO-DUPLICATESP-EQUAL.html">no-duplicatesp-equal</a> y)</span> is the symbol <span class="v">t</span>, 
  <span class="tt">(p x y)</span> is not the symbol <span class="v">nil</span>, and <span class="v">x</span> is a non-negative 
  integer (i.e., a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a></span>).</p> 
 
  <p>ACL2 computes a type-alist based on contextual information including the 
  hypotheses of the current goal (technically: the negations of the literals in 
  the goal that are not currently being rewritten), <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> 
  from those literals, and the surrounding tests in calls of <span class="v">if</span>.  The 
  type-alist is of course not all that is known, since an entire logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> of facts is also known; and additional known information may be 
  recorded in the current database of <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> rules.</p>
