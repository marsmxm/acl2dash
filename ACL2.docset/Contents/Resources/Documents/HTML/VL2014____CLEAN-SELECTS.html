<p>Simplify concatenations and selects throughout a module.</p><p>This is a mainly aesthetic transform that applies <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-CLEAN-SELECTS.html">vl-expr-clean-selects</a> throughout modules.  This may help to make certain 
concatenation and select expressions more readable.</p> 
 
<p>Implementation-wise, this is the usual boilerplate to extend <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-CLEAN-SELECTS.html">vl-expr-clean-selects</a> through the parse tree, except that we aren't going to 
go through ranges: we only do this in assignments, instances, and statements, 
where we expect to see wires.</p>
