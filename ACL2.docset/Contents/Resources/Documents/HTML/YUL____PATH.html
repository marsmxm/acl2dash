</dl><p>A path is a non-empty sequence of identifiers, separated by dots. 
     Here we define a path as a list of identifiers, 
     wrapped in a one-field product type. 
     In the future we may add an invariant that the list is not empty.</p><p>Representing paths as a wrapped list of identifiers, 
     as opposed to just a list of identifiers, 
     lets us make a finer distinction between 
     lists of identifiers representing paths (when wrapped), 
     and just lists of identifiers that may be used for other purposes. 
     In other words, the wrapping conveys that it is a path, 
     and that the identifiers in the list are separated by dots 
     (if written in concrete syntax).</p>
