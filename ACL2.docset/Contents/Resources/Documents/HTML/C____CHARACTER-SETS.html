<p>Source and execution character sets.</p><p>These are described in [C:5.2.1].</p><p>The members of these sets are more abstract entities 
     than the values of the character types [C:6.2.5/15]. 
     The assignment of values to the members of the execution character set 
     is implementation-defined [C:5.2.1/1], 
     subject to some constraints. 
     The source and execution character sets may be different, 
     subject to certain constraints and correspondences.</p><p>Our formalization is parameterized over the specifics of 
     the source and execution character sets. 
     We represent these character sets via 
     suitably constrained ACL2 predicates and mappings.</p>
