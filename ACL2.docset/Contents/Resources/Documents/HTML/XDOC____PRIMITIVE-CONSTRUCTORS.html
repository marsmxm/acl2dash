<p>Primitive XDOC constructors.</p><p>These correspond to 
      individual XML tags, 
      individual preprocessor directives, 
      and tree concatenation. 
      In contrast, the 
      <a href="XDOC____COMPOSITE-CONSTRUCTORS.html">composite 
      XDOC constructors</a> 
      correspond to multiple tags, directives, and concatenations, 
      or provide a more concise notation for common attributes.</p> 
   <p>These primitive constructors are 
      macros with a variable number of arguments. 
      Each argument must be a tree or a keyword, 
      such that each keyword is immediately followed by a tree. 
      Each keyword-tree pair forms an attribute of an XML tag, 
      with the keyword naming the attribute 
      and the immediately following tree providing the value of the attribute. 
      Keyword-tree pairs can be used only in constructors for XML tags, 
      not in constructors for preprocessor directives or tree concatenation. 
      Keyword-tree pairs may occur anywhere in the argument list. 
      See the <a href="XDOC____CONSTRUCTORS.html">top-level topic</a> 
      for example calls of primitive constructors.</p> 
   <p>Since these primitive constructors have a very uniform structure, 
      we introduce them via two event-generating macros, 
      one for XML tags 
      and one for preprocessor directives and tree concatenation.</p>
