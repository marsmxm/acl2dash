<p>A <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> field mapping stobj names to stobjs</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> for basic background on stobjs, and see <a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> for detailed documentation on the syntax and semantics of stobjs, 
 including fields specified with <span class="v">:type (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a>)</span> or 
 <span class="v">:type (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a> SIZE)</span> for some natural number, <span class="v">SIZE</span>.  We call 
 such fields ``stobj-table fields''; this documentation topic explains them, 
 and it assumes familiarity with stobj fields of stobjs as documented in <a href="ACL2____NESTED-STOBJS.html">nested-stobjs</a> â€” especially, the use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a></span> to read and 
 write such fields.  Note that the documentation for <a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> shows the 
 default names for accessors and updaters; for a stobj-table field, <span class="v">TBL</span>, 
 these are <span class="v">TBL-GET</span> and <span class="v">TBL-PUT</span>, respectively.</p> 
 
 <p>For examples of <span class="v">stobj-let</span> usage for stobj-tables, see <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a> <span class="v">books/system/tests/stobj-table-tests-input.lsp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A stobj-table field may be viewed as an association list mapping stobj 
 names to corresponding stobjs, so that each stobj name maps to a stobj that 
 satisfies the recognizer for that stobj name.  This requirement is not 
 enforced in the logic (i.e., in recognizer functions).  But it is essentially 
 maintained in raw Lisp as an invariant, except that for efficiency, a 
 stobj-table field is implemented as a hash-table (again, mapping stobj names 
 to corresponding stobjs).  Below we give more details and explain how 
 <span class="v">stobj-let</span> may be used to access and update stobjs that are in such a 
 table.</p> 
 
 <p>The general forms for stobj-table fields of stobjs are as shown below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> NAME
  (TBL1 :type (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a>))      ; stobj field of default size
  ...
  (TBL2 :type (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a> SIZE)) ; stobj field of desired size SIZE
  ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>That is, a stobj-table field is a field whose type is of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a>)</span> or <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a> SIZE)</span>.  The syntax is thus much like 
 the syntax for hash-table fields of stobjs, except that there is no test 
 specified for a stobj-table (it is actually <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span> in raw Lisp).</p> 
 
 <p>As noted above, a stobj-table is conceptually an alist that associates 
 stobj names with corresponding stobjs.  We say ``conceptually'' because in 
 fact, the recognizer for any stobj-table field is <span class="v">t</span>: there is no 
 requirement that it is actually an alist.  It is accessed logically with 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">hons-assoc-equal</a></span>, which is a variant of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ASSOC.html">assoc</a></span> that treats an 
 arbitrary object as an alist: only pairs are considered when looking up a key, 
 and the final cdr is ignored.  A default value is returned when there is no 
 pair with the given key.  A stobj-table field is thus very much like a 
 hash-table field.  The key difference (pun somewhat intended) is that each key 
 of a stobj-table is the name of a stobj (other than <span class="v">state</span>, i.e., it is a 
 user-defined stobj name), and the corresponding value is a stobj satisfying 
 the recognizer for that name.</p> 
 
 <p>A common case is that a stobj-table field is the unique field of its parent 
 stobj.  In that case we may think of the entire stobj as a stobj-table, and 
 that is actually consistent with the implementation: in raw Lisp, if a 
 stobj-table field is the sole field of its parent stobj, then that stobj-table 
 field is actually the entire stobj; there is not the usual indirection in raw 
 Lisp, where a stobj is a vector of fields and the field is accessed as an 
 entry in that vector.  (Logically, however, a stobj is always a list of its 
 fields, even if there is only one field.)</p> 
 
 <p>Reads and writes of a stobj-table field are much like reads and writes when 
 the field is an array of stobjs.  In both cases, one uses <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a></span> to 
 access and possibly update the desired individual stobj or stobjs.  The syntax 
 thus looks as follows, where <span class="v">ST</span> is a stobj name and <span class="v">PARENT</span> is the 
 name of a stobj that has a stobj-table accessor with name <span class="v">TBL-GET</span>.  Note 
 that the first argument of the accessor must be the quotation of the name of 
 the bound stobj (thus below, <span class="v">'ST</span> is the quotation of <span class="v">ST</span>) and the 
 third argument must be a call of that stobj's creator function.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a> (...                                 ; bindings
            (ST (TBL-GET 'ST PARENT (CREATE-ST)))
            ...
            )
           (...)                                ; producer variables
           (...)                                ; producer
           ...                                  ; consumer
           )</pre> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">TBL-GET</span> call above always returns an object that satisfies the 
 recognizer for the stobj, <span class="v">ST</span>.  However, that is a fact about evaluation; 
 it is not provable in the logic.  Fortunately, <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> verification 
 typically adds hypotheses to this effect when necessary.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark</b>.  This remark on the implementation may be skipped, but it 
 may provide some intuition.  When a stobj name is not bound in the underlying 
 hash-table, then the default value (in the example above, <span class="v">(CREATE-ST)</span>) 
 provides a suitable stobj nonetheless.  And if that stobj name is among the 
 producer variables of a <span class="v">stobj-let</span> form, it will be bound in the 
 underlying hash-table when the <span class="v">stobj-let</span> form completes.  End of 
 remark.</p> 
 
 <p>The remainder of this topic explains the use of stobj-tables by following 
 the example in <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a> <span class="v">std/stobjs/stobj-table.lisp</span>.  The 
 first form in that book (after the initial <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></span> form) is as 
 follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> stobj-table (tbl :type (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a>)))</pre> 
 
 <p>This specifies a stobj named <span class="v">stobj-table</span> with a unique field, 
 <span class="v">tbl</span>.  As noted above, this stobj is the same as its field in raw Lisp, so 
 even though it is the field that is truly a stobj-table, it is not 
 conceptually problematic to call the entire stobj ``stobj-table''.  This may 
 be the most common case for a stobj-table (i.e., being a unique field of a 
 stobj).</p> 
 
 <p>The remaining forms in the book are <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> to the book, intended to 
 illustrate with simple examples how stobj-tables may be used.  The first one 
 just introduces a rather trivial stobj.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st1 fld1)</pre> 
 
 <p>The next form puts this stobj into the stobj-table after updating its field 
 with a specified value.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> update-st1-in-tbl (val stobj-table)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs stobj-table))
  (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a> ((st1 (tbl-get 'st1 stobj-table (create-st1)))) ; bindings
             (st1)                                        ; producer variable
             (update-fld1 val st1)                        ; producer
             stobj-table                                  ; consumer
             ))</pre> 
 
 <p>The form after that accesses the value of <span class="v">'st1</span> in the stobj-table and 
 returns its field's value.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> read-st1-in-tbl1 (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a>)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs stobj-table))
  (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a> ((st1 (tbl-get 'st1 stobj-table (create-st1)))) ; bindings
             (val)                                        ; producer variable
             (fld1 st1)                                   ; producer
             val                                          ; consumer
             ))</pre> 
 
 <p>Next is a check that when a specific value is written for the key <span class="v">'st1</span> 
 with the update function defined above, the value subsequently read for key 
 <span class="v">'st1</span> is that written value.  The reason for the <span class="v">mv</span> call is that the 
 updater returns an updated stobj-table, which therefore must be returned. 
 However, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSERT-EVENT.html">assert-event</a></span> is sufficiently clever to check that the 
 first (i.e., ordinary) value returned is non-<span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ASSERT-EVENT.html">assert-event</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a> (update-st1-in-tbl 3 stobj-table)))
   (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (read-st1-in-tbl1 stobj-table)
              3)
       stobj-table))
 :stobjs-out '(nil stobj-table))</pre> 
 
 <p>The computation above is a special case of a standard ``read-over-write'' 
 property, that after a write, we read the value that was just written.  This 
 is proved automatically.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> read-over-write-st1-in-tbl
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (stobj-tablep stobj-table)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a> (update-st1-in-tbl val stobj-table)))
             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (read-st1-in-tbl1 stobj-table)
                    val))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The other standard ``read-over-write'' property is that the write for a 
 given key doesn't affect the value read for a different key.  The following 
 events, admitted automatically, illustrate that property: here, writing a 
 value for the key <span class="v">'st1</span> doesn't affect the value read for the key 
 <span class="v">'st2</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st2 fld2)

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> read-st2-in-tbl (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-TABLE.html">stobj-table</a>)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs stobj-table))
  (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a> ((st2 (tbl-get 'st2 stobj-table (create-st2)))) ; bindings
             (val)                                        ; producer variable
             (fld2 st2)                                   ; producer
             val                                          ; consumer
             ))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> read-over-write-st2-in-tbl
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (stobj-tablep stobj-table)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((stobj-table-2 (update-st1-in-tbl val stobj-table)))
             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (read-st2-in-tbl stobj-table-2)
                    (read-st2-in-tbl stobj-table)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that all keys in a stobj-table are names of stobjs.  Consider what 
 heppens when we evaluate the events in the book above, including the local 
 events, and then undo the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> event admitting <span class="v">st1</span>.  It is 
 clear that undoing has removed the symbol <span class="v">st1</span> as a key in the 
 stobj-table.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> "std/stobjs/stobj-table.lisp" :dir :system)
[[.. output omitted ..]]
ACL2 !&gt;(tbl-count stobj-table)
1
ACL2 !&gt;:ubt st1
   d       1:x(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">DEFSTOBJ</a> STOBJ-TABLE (TBL :TYPE #))
ACL2 !&gt;(tbl-count stobj-table)
0
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Finally, we remark that there is nothing special about stobj-table fields 
 with respect to stobj fields of abstract stobjs.</p>
