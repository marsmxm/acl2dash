<p>Compress a one-dimensional array only if necessary</p><p>The call <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAYBE-FLUSH-AND-COMPRESS1.html">maybe-flush-and-compress1</a> name ar)</span> is equivalent to 
 the first calling <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FLUSH-COMPRESS.html">flush-compress</a> name)</span> and then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a> name
 ar)</span>, except that both operations are skipped (and <span class="v">ar</span> is returned) if 
 <span class="v">ar</span>, which has name <span class="v">name</span>, is already compressed.</p>
