 <p>Now that you have seen the theorem prover in action you might be curious as 
 to how you guide it.</p> 
 
 <p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/interactive-theorem-prover.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <p>Look at the picture above.  It is meant to suggest that <i>Q</i> is an 
 important lemma needed for the proof of <i>P</i>.  Note that to lead the 
 prover to the proof of <i>P</i> the user first proves <i>Q</i>.  In a way, the 
 formulation and proof of <i>Q</i> is a hint to the prover about how to prove 
 <i>P</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>The user usually doesn't think of <i>Q</i> or recognize the need to prove 
 it separately until he or she sees the theorem prover <b>fail</b> to prove 
 <i>P</i> without it ``knowing'' <i>Q</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>The way the user typically discovers the need for <i>Q</i> is to look at 
 failed proofs.</p>
