<p>On the Naming of Subgoals</p><p><span class="v">Subgoal *1/2</span> is the <b>induction step</b> from the scheme, 
 obtained by instantiating the scheme with our conjecture.</p> 
 
 <p>We number the cases ``backward'', so this is case ``2'' of the proof of 
 ``*1''.  We number them backward so you can look at a subgoal number and get 
 an estimate for how close you are to the end.</p>
