<p>Backward-compatibility aliases for <a href="STR____PRINTTREE.html">str::printtree</a>.</p><p>Formerly, VL defined its own type <span class="v">vl-printedlist</span> which was 
basically a tree structure containing characters and strings.  A similar one is 
now defined in <span class="v">std/strings/printtree.lisp</span> and <span class="v">vl-printedlist</span> 
functions are now aliases for <span class="v">str::printtree</span> functions.</p>
