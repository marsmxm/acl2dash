General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> table-name key-term value-term op term)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">table-name</span> is a symbol that is the name of a (possibly new) 
 table; <span class="v">key-term</span> and <span class="v">value-term</span>, if present, are arbitrary terms 
 involving (at most) the variables <span class="v">WORLD</span> and <span class="v">ENS</span>; <span class="v">op</span>, if 
 present, is one of the table operations below; and <span class="v">term</span>, if present, is a 
 term.  <span class="v">Table</span> returns an ACL2 <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>.  The effect of 
 <span class="v">table</span> on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> depends on <span class="v">op</span> and how many arguments are 
 presented.  Some invocations actually have no effect on the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> 
 and hence an invocation of <span class="v">table</span> is not always an ``event''.  We explain 
 below, after giving some background information.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Important Note:</b> The <span class="v">table</span> forms above are calls of a macro that 
 expand to involve the special variable <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.  This will prevent you 
 from accessing a table from within a hint or theory where you do not have the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> variable.  However, the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE-ALIST.html">table-alist</a> 'tests world)</pre> 
 
 <p>returns the alist representation of the table named <span class="v">test</span> in the given 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a></span>.  Often you have access to <span class="v">world</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 system provides ``tables'' by which the user can associate one 
 object with another.  Tables are in essence just conventional association 
 lists — lists of pairs — but the ACL2 environment provides a means 
 of storing these lists in the ``ACL2 world'' of the current <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>. 
 The ACL2 user could accomplish the same ends by using ACL2 ``global 
 variables''; however, limitations on global variable names are imposed to 
 ensure ACL2's soundness.  Some features of the system use tables, and the user 
 is invited to make free use of tables.  By convention, no user-defined table 
 is important to ACL2's soundness.  Because tables are stored in the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> they are restored by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> and undone by <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span>.  Many users of Nqthm requested a facility by which user data could be 
 saved in Nqthm ``lib files'' and tables are ACL2's answer to that request.</p> 
 
 <p>Abstractly, each table is an association list mapping ``keys'' to 
 ``values.'' In addition, each table has a ``<span class="v">:guard</span>,'' which is a term 
 that must be true of any key and value used.  By setting the <span class="v">:guard</span> on a 
 table you may enforce an invariant on the objects in the table, e.g., that all 
 keys are positive integers and all values are symbols.  Note that attachments 
 are allowed when evaluating a table guard (see <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>).  Each table 
 has a ``name,'' which must be a symbol.  Given a table name, the following 
 operations can be performed on the table.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:put</span> — associate a value with a key (possibly changing the value 
 currently associated with that key).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:get</span> — retrieve the value associated with a key (or nil if no 
 value has been associated with that key).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:alist</span> — return an alist showing all keys and non-nil values in 
 the table.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:clear</span> — clear the table (so that every value is nil), or if val 
 is supplied then set table to that value (which must be an alist).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:guard</span> — fetch or set the :guard of the table.</p> 
 
 <p>When the operations above suggest that the table or its <span class="v">:guard</span> are 
 modified, what is actually meant is that the current <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> is redefined 
 so that in it, the affected table name has the appropriate properties.  in 
 such cases, the <span class="v">table</span> form is an event (see <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>).  In the 
 <span class="v">:put</span> case, if the key is already in the table and associated with the 
 proposed value, then the <span class="v">table</span> event is redundant (see <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Table</span> forms are commonly typed by the user while interacting with the 
 system.  <span class="v">:Put</span> and <span class="v">:get</span> forms are especially common.  Therefore, we 
 have adopted a positional syntax that is intended to be convenient for most 
 applications.  Essentially, some operations admit a ``short form'' of 
 invocation.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name key-term value-term :put)   ; long form
(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name key-term value-term)        ; short form</pre> 
 
 <p>evaluates the key- and value-terms, obtaining two objects that we call 
 <span class="v">key</span> and <span class="v">value</span>, checks that the <span class="v">key</span> and <span class="v">value</span> satisfy the 
 <span class="v">:guard</span> on the named table and then ``modifies'' the named table so that 
 the value associated with <span class="v">key</span> is <span class="v">value</span>.  When used like this, 
 <span class="v">table</span> is actually an event in the sense that it changes the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  In general, the forms that are evaluated to obtain the <span class="v">key</span> and 
 <span class="v">value</span> may involve two variables: <span class="v">WORLD</span>, which is bound to the 
 then-current <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>; and <span class="v">ENS</span>, which is bound to the enabled 
 structure representing the current theory.  (The enabled structure is passed 
 as a formal parameter to many built-in functions; for example, see <a href="ACL2____SYSTEM-UTILITIES.html">system-utilities</a> for a description of built-in utilities <span class="v">enabled-numep</span> 
 and <span class="v">enabled-runep</span>.)  However, in the special case that the table in 
 question is named <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, the <span class="v">key</span> and <span class="v">value</span> 
 terms may not contain any variables.  Essentially, the keys and values used in 
 <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> setting the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span> must be explicitly given 
 constants.  See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name key-term nil :get)          ; long form
(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name key-term)                   ; short form</pre> 
 
 <p>evaluates the key-term (see note below), obtaining an object, <span class="v">key</span>, and 
 returns the value associated with <span class="v">key</span> in the named table (or, <span class="v">nil</span> if 
 there is no value associated with <span class="v">key</span>).  When used like this, <span class="v">table</span> 
 is not an event; the value is simply returned.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name nil nil :alist)             ; long form
(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name)                            ; short form</pre> 
 
 <p>returns an alist representing the named table; for every key in the table 
 with a non-<span class="v">nil</span> associated value, the alist pairs the key and its value. 
 The order in which the keys are presented is unspecified.  When used like 
 this, <span class="v">table</span> is not an event; the alist is simply returned.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name nil val :clear)</pre> 
 
 <p>sets the named table to the alist <span class="v">val</span>, making the checks that 
 <span class="v">:put</span> makes for each key and value of <span class="v">val</span>.  When used like this, 
 <span class="v">table</span> is an event because it changes the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name nil nil :guard)</pre> 
 
 <p>returns the translated form of the guard of the named table.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> name nil nil :guard term)</pre> 
 
 <p>This event sets the <span class="v">:guard</span> of the named table to <span class="v">term</span>, provided 
 the following requirements are met.  The named table must be empty and it must 
 not have been assigned a <span class="v">:guard</span> yet.  <span class="v">Term</span> (which is not evaluated) 
 should be a term that mentions at most the variables <span class="v">KEY</span>, <span class="v">VAL</span>, 
 <span class="v">WORLD</span>, <span class="v">ENS</span>, and <span class="v">STATE</span>.  In the common case <span class="v">term</span> will 
 evaluate to a single value, but it can return two values as discussed later 
 below; either way, it must not return <span class="v">STATE</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Whenever a subsequent <span class="v">:put</span> occurs, <span class="v">term</span> will be evaluated with 
 <span class="v">KEY</span> bound to the key argument of the <span class="v">:put</span>, <span class="v">VAL</span> bound to the 
 <span class="v">val</span> argument of the <span class="v">:put</span>, <span class="v">WORLD</span> bound to the then current <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, <span class="v">ENS</span> bound to the enabled structure representing the current 
 theory, and <span class="v">STATE</span> bound to the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  The term is evaluated. 
 An error will be caused by the <span class="v">:put</span> if the result of the evaluation is 
 <span class="v">nil</span> when a single value is returned; what if two values are returned?</p> 
 
 <p>If the term returns multiple values <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> okp msg)</span>, then an error will 
 be caused if <span class="v">okp</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.  In that case, if <span class="v">msg</span> is also <span class="v">nil</span> 
 then a generic error message is printed about the illegal key/value pair, just 
 as in the single-value return case.  Otherwise <span class="v">msg</span> should be a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSGP.html">msgp</a></span> — a string or a cons suitable for printing with the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span> 
 directive, <span class="v">~@</span>.  In that case, <span class="v">msg</span> is printed (using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span> 
 <span class="v">~@</span>) instead of the generic error message.  Here is a simple example from 
 the ACL2 sources.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> partial-functions-table-guard (fn val wrld)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((msg0 ; nil if fn/val is OK as a key/value pair, else a msg
         (partial-functions-table-guard-msg fn val wrld)))
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a>
     (msg0 (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> nil
               (<a href="ACL2____MSG.html">msg</a>
                "Illegal partial-functions-table key and value (see :DOC ~
                 memoize-partial):~|key = ~y0value  = ~y1Reason:~%~@2~|~%"
                fn val msg0)))
     (t (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> t nil)))))

(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> partial-functions-table nil nil
       :guard
       (partial-functions-table-guard key val world))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that it is not allowed to change the <span class="v">:guard</span> on a table once it 
 has been explicitly set.  Before the <span class="v">:guard</span> is explicitly set, it is 
 effectively just <span class="v">t</span>.  After it is set it can be changed only by undoing 
 the event that set it.  The purpose of this restriction is to prevent the user 
 from changing the <span class="v">:guards</span> on tables provided by other people or the 
 system.</p> 
 
 <p>The intuition behind the <span class="v">:guard</span> mechanism on tables is to enforce 
 invariants on the keys and values in a table, so that the values, say, can be 
 used without run-time checking.  But if the <span class="v">:guard</span> of a table is 
 sensitive to the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, it may be possible to cause some value in 
 the table to cease satisfying the <span class="v">:guard</span> without doing any operations on 
 the table.  Consider for example the <span class="v">:guard</span> ``no value in this table is 
 the name of an event.'' As described, that is enforced each time a value is 
 stored.  Thus, <span class="v">'bang</span> can be <span class="v">:put</span> in the table provided there is no 
 event named <span class="v">bang</span>.  But once it is in the table, there is nothing to 
 prevent the user from defining <span class="v">bang</span> as a function, causing the table to 
 contain a value that could not be <span class="v">:put</span> there anymore.  Observe that not 
 all state-sensitive <span class="v">:guard</span>s suffer this problem.  The <span class="v">:guard</span> ``every 
 value is an event name'' remains invariant, courtesy of the fact that undoing 
 back through an event name in the table would necessarily undo the <span class="v">:put</span> 
 of the name into the table.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Table</span> was designed primarily for convenient top-level use.  Tables are 
 not especially efficient.  Each table is represented by an alist stored on the 
 property list of the table name.  <span class="v">:Get</span> is just a <span class="v">getprop</span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a></span>.  <span class="v">:Put</span> does a <span class="v">getprop</span> to the get the table alist, a 
 <span class="v">put-assoc-equal</span> to record the new association, and a <span class="v">putprop</span> to 
 store the new table alist — plus the overhead associated with 
 <span class="v">:guard</span>s and undoable <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, and checking (for redundancy) if the 
 key is already bound to its proposed value.  Note that there are never 
 duplicate keys in the resulting <span class="v">alist</span>; in particular, when the operation 
 <span class="v">:clear</span> is used to install new <span class="v">alist</span>, duplicate keys are removed from 
 that alist.</p> 
 
 <p>A table name may be any symbol whatsoever.  Symbols already in use as 
 function or theorem names, for example, may be used as table names.  Symbols 
 in use only as table names may be defined with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, etc.  Because 
 there are no restrictions on the user's choice of table names, table names are 
 not included among the logical names.  Thus, <span class="v">:pe name</span> will never display 
 a table event (for a logical name other than <span class="v">:here</span>).  Either <span class="v">:pe
 name</span> will display a ``normal'' event such as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> name ...)</span> or 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> name ...)</span> or else <span class="v">:pe name</span> will cause an error indicating 
 that <span class="v">name</span> is not a logical name.  This happens even if <span class="v">name</span> is in 
 use as a table name.</p>
