<p>A Tiny Warning Sign</p><p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/warning.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <p>This warning sign, which usually appears as ``<img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif">'', 
 indicates that the link it marks takes you into ACL2's online 
 documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>The documentation is a vast graph of documented topics intended to help the 
 <i>user</i> of ACL2 rather than the <i>potential user</i>.  If you are 
 exploring ACL2's home page to learn about the system, perhaps you should go 
 back rather than follow the link marked with this sign.  But you are welcome 
 to explore the online documentation as well.  Good luck.</p>
