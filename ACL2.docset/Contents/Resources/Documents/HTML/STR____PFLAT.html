<p>Print some objects all on one line.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>width â€” <a href="ACL2____POSP.html">posp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The width of what will be printed.</dd> 
 
<dt>what</dt> 
<dd>The object(s) to print flat.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>Think of <span class="v">what</span> as a (perhaps improper) list.  This instruction 
means to print the elements of <span class="v">what</span>, and its final cdr, separated 
appropriately by spaces or dot.</p> 
 
<p>Usually <span class="v">what</span> is a proper list, say <span class="v">(X1 ... XN)</span>.  In this case, we 
print these elements, separated by spaces, all on one line.</p> 
 
<p>When <span class="v">what</span> is instead an improper list, say <span class="v">(X1 ... XN . LAST)</span>, we 
again print the Xi separated by spaces, but then also print <span class="v">. LAST</span>. 
Here <span class="v">last</span> might be some (non-nil) atom or an eviscerated object.</p> 
 
<p>When <span class="v">what</span> is a single, non-NIL atom, we print <span class="v">. WHAT</span>.  Note that 
this doesn't correspond to any actual Lisp object in isolation.  That is, no 
Lisp object prints as <span class="v">. FOO</span>.</p>
