<p>An ACL2 Formalization of an Instant-Runoff Voting Scheme</p><p>The function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IRV.html">irv</a></span> formalizes the following instant-runoff 
  voting scheme.</p> 
 
  <p>The winner of an IRV election will be chosen as follows:</p> 
 
  <ol> 
 
   <li>If a candidate is the first choice of more than half of the voters, then 
       he/she wins.  Otherwise:</li> 
 
   <li>Adjust each ballot by eliminating the candidate with the fewest 
       first-place votes.  If there is a tie for the fewest first-place votes, 
       then delete the candidate with the least second-place votes, and so on. 
       If the tie persists all through to the last-place level, then resolve it 
       using a tie-breaker function that picks exactly one candidate out of 
       those involved in the tie.</li> 
 
   <li>Go to the first step.</li> 
 
 </ol> 
 
 <p>See <a href="IRV____FAIRNESS-CRITERIA.html">fairness-criteria</a> for some fairness theorems about this 
 voting scheme.  We also define a simpler version of IRV --- <span class="tt"><a href="IRV____IRV-ALT.html">irv-alt</a></span> --- that may be suitable for proofs of certain kinds of 
 properties.</p> 
 
 <h4>Notes</h4> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>This IRV formalization accepts partial as well as total rankings; i.e., a 
     voter can choose to rank a subset of the candidates in the election.</li> 
 
 <li>The tie-breaker function <span class="v">pick-candidate</span> is constrained, so you can 
 define your own tie-breaker method for execution.  By default, we attach the 
 function <span class="tt"><a href="IRV____PICK-CANDIDATE-WITH-SMALLEST-ID.html">pick-candidate-with-smallest-id</a></span> to <span class="v">pick-candidate</span> to 
 pick the candidate with the smallest identifier.</li> 
 
 </ul>
