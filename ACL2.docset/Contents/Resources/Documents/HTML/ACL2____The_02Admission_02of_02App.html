<p>The Admission of App</p><p><a href="ACL2____Revisiting_02the_02Admission_02of_02App.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/walking.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>Here is what it looks like to submit the definition of <span class="v">app</span> to 
 ACL2:</p> 
 
 <p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/green-line.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;<b>(defun app (x y)</b> 
  <b>(cond ((endp x) y)</b> 
        <b>(t (cons (car x) </b> 
                 <b>(app (cdr x) y)))))</b> 
 
The admission of APP is trivial, using the relation O&lt; (which 
is known to be well-founded on the domain recognized by O-P) 
and the measure (ACL2-COUNT X).  We observe that the type of APP is 
described by the theorem (OR (CONSP (APP X Y)) (EQUAL (APP X Y) Y)). 
We used primitive type reasoning.

 <p>The text between the lines above is one interaction with the ACL2 command 
 loop.  Interacting with the latest version of ACL2 may not produce the very 
 same output, but we trust you'll recognize the basics.</p> 
 
 <p>Above you see the user's <b>input</b> and how the system responds.  This 
 little example shows you what the syntax looks like and is a very typical 
 <b>successful</b> interaction with the definitional principle.</p> 
 
 <p>Let's look at it a little more closely.</p>
