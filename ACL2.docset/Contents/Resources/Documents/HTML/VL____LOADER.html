<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=VL____LOADER">Click for Loader in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Finds and loads Verilog or SystemVerilog source filesgenerally 
the first step toward using VL to work with a hardware design.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>Most Verilog designs involve many files spread out across multiple 
directories.  To really load a high-level module <span class="v">top</span>, we typically need 
to:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>start by parsing its file, say <span class="v">top.v</span> or <span class="v">top.sv</span>, then</li> 
 
<li>figure out which supporting descriptions are used within <span class="v">top</span> and </li> 
 
<li>use a search procedure to load these supporting descriptions from library 
directories.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>VL's top-level function for loading Verilog files, <a href="VL____VL-LOAD.html">vl-load</a>, 
implements such a scheme.  It has various options (see <a href="VL____VL-LOADCONFIG.html">vl-loadconfig</a>) 
that allow you to specify the search paths and extensions to use when looking 
for files, etc.  A typical command to load a design might look something like 
this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a> (*loadresult* state)
  (<a href="VL____VL-LOAD.html">vl::vl-load</a> (<a href="VL____MAKE-VL-LOADCONFIG.html">vl::make-vl-loadconfig</a>
                :start-files (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> "top.v")
                :search-path (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> "/path/to/lib1"
                                   "/path/to/lib2")
                :include-dirs (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> "/path/to/includes1"
                                    "/path/to/includes2")
                :defines (make-vl-initial-defines "FORMAL")
                :edition :system-verilog-2012)))</pre> 
 
<p>The resulting <span class="v">*loadresult*</span> will be a <a href="VL____VL-LOADRESULT.html">vl-loadresult</a>, which among 
other things will contain the <a href="VL____VL-DESIGN.html">vl-design</a> that has been loaded.  The next 
step after loading is typically to <b>annotate</b> the design using <a href="VL____VL-ANNOTATE-DESIGN.html">vl-annotate-design</a>, and then to further processing it in whatever way is 
suitable for your particular flow.</p> 
 
<h3>Supported Constructs and Workarounds</h3> 
 
<p>For general background on what VL supports, see <a href="VL____SUPPORTED-CONSTRUCTS.html">supported-constructs</a>.</p> 
 
<p>A common problem when working with a Verilog or SystemVerilog design is that 
you want to process the design with many tools, and these tools may not all 
support quite the same constructs.  One common way to work around these issues 
is with <a href="VL____PREPROCESSOR.html">preprocessor</a> directives.  For instance, you might write 
something like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">`ifndef FORMAL
   ... something VL can't handle ...
`else
   ... replacement for VL ...
`endif</pre> 
 
<p>Note that <a href="VL____VL-LOAD.html">vl-load</a> does not automatically set up any such <span class="v">`define</span> 
directives by default, but it's easy to give custom <span class="v">defines</span> in your <a href="VL____VL-LOADCONFIG.html">vl-loadconfig</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Besides the preprocessor, VL also supports a special comment syntax that can 
be used to hide VL-specific code from other tools:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">//+VL single-line version
/*+VL multi-line version */</pre> 
 
<p>For instance, if you need your modules to work with an old Verilog 
implementation that doesn't support Verilog-2005 style attributes, you might 
write something like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">//+VL (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> my_attribute *)
assign foo = bar;</pre> 
 
<p>VL will still parse the <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> my_attribute *)</span> part since it is in this 
special comment.  VL also provides a special, more concise syntax for 
attributes:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">//@VL my_attribute</pre> 
 
<p>Note that you can also disable these special comments with the <span class="v">strictp</span> 
option on your <a href="VL____VL-LOADCONFIG.html">vl-loadconfig</a>.</p>
