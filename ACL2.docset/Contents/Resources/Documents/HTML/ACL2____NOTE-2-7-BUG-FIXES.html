<p>ACL2 Version  2.7 Notes on Bug Fixes</p><p>Francisco J. Martin-Mateos emailed us a soundness bug (!) in our 
 handling of functional instantiation (for example see <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION-EXAMPLE.html">functional-instantiation-example</a>).  We are grateful for that email, which 
 clearly illustrated the problem.  It is included just below the definition of 
 <span class="v">push-clause</span> in ACL2 source file <span class="v">prove.lisp</span>, where we have fixed the 
 bug.  This bug was fixed in a re-release of Version 2.6 in February, 2002.</p> 
 
 <p>Rob Sumners emailed us a soundness bug (!) in function <span class="v">commutative-p1</span>, 
 which is used by the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____BDD.html">bdd</a> package.  We are grateful for his help; 
 his email gave a proof of nil and also pointed to the problem function.  This 
 bug was fixed in a re-release of Version 2.6 in February, 2002.</p> 
 
 <p>We discovered and fixed a soundness bug illustrated by the book below, 
 which was certifiable in Version 2.6 and ends in a proof of <span class="v">nil</span>.  The 
 event <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> foo)</span> should have been rejected, because <span class="v">foo</span> 
 calls a function whose guards have not been verified, namely, <span class="v">bar</span>. 
 However, ACL2 did not notice the call of function <span class="v">bar</span> in the body of 
 <span class="v">foo</span> because it was looking in the simplified (normalized) body of 
 <span class="v">foo</span> rather than in the original body of <span class="v">foo</span>.  During processing of 
 the book below, the logical definition of <span class="v">zp</span> is used before 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> foo)</span>, and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> -3)</span> reduces to <span class="v">t</span> in the logic. 
 After <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> foo)</span>, ACL2 simplifies <span class="v">(foo -3)</span> by going into 
 raw Lisp, where <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> -3)</span> is evaluated and reduces to <span class="v">nil</span>.</p>

 <p>The above bug exploited the fact that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a></span> has a different definition 
 in raw Lisp than in the logic for arguments that violate its guard).  The 
 following example caused a hard error in raw Lisp, though not a soundness 
 error.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> bar (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t
                  :verify-guards nil))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (bar x) x nil))
(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> foo)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bug
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (foo 3) t)
  :rule-classes nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>We have made a minor change to the notion of the <i>formula</i> of a 
 function symbol, related to the change above, which however is unlikely to be 
 noticeable.</p> 
 
 <p>In order to make it harder to hit problems like the guard problem above, we 
 have slightly modified the raw Lisp definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a></span> command, <span class="v">:ancestors</span>, was broken, but has been 
 fixed.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing the problem to our attention, and to 
 Robert Krug for supplying the final part of the fix.</p> 
 
 <p>Some <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> commands caused errors when all goals have 
 already been proved.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to Matt Wilding for 
 reporting this bug.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span>.  When compiling uncompiled functions 
 with very large definitions, ACL2 was inserted a backslash (<span class="v">\</span>) character 
 into generated files.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed the <span class="v">:type-alist</span> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a></span> command (see <a href="ACL2____BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a>), whose output was difficult to read when typed after an 
 <span class="v">:eval</span>..</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed some clumsy handling of errors when including an uncertified book, 
 for example, with the error message when including an uncertified book with a 
 bad <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></span> event.  Thanks to Eric Smith for pointing out this 
 problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Two modifications to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> now cause it to reflect natural 
 expectations with respect to soundness.  First, it now has default values of 
 <span class="v">nil</span> instead of <span class="v">t</span> for keyword arguments <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp</span> and 
 <span class="v">:defaxioms-okp</span>.  Thanks to Robert Krug for suggesting this change and the 
 ACL2 seminar at the University of Texas for discussing it.  Second, when 
 <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp</span> (respectively, <span class="v">:defaxioms-okp</span>) is <span class="v">nil</span>, either 
 explicitly or by default, then <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> commands (respectively, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> events) are disallowed inside any included books, regardless 
 of the keyword parameters passed to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  This had not been 
 the case for previous versions of ACL2, regardless of the values of 
 <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp</span> or <span class="v">:defaxioms-okp</span> passed to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved warnings and errors for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> to mention the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> as a possible source of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>s.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 formerly caused an error when <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> in a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> were not well-formed.  This situation could arise as follows when 
 certifying a book.  A lemma FOO is proved <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>ly to the book (or, is 
 present in a sub-book that is included locally).  The <span class="v">:corollary</span> of a 
 subsequent theorem, BAR, disables that rule in a hint.  When BAR is proved, 
 this is not a problem.  But <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> makes a second pass after 
 processing the events in a book: it essentially does an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>. 
 During the <span class="v">include-book</span> pass, FOO is not known (because it was <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>), and therefore ACL2 fails to process the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a></span> of FOO in an 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></span> hint.  The fix is that during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> are ignored in corollaries just as they have been for the main theorem 
 (or definition).</p> 
 
 <p>It was possible for guard verification to succeed where it should have 
 failed.  We have fixed the bug (which was in source function (ironically 
 named!) <span class="v">fcons-term-smart</span>).  Thanks to Robert Krug for sending us an 
 example of bungled guard verification.  It turns out that this bug was also 
 present in Version_2.6.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command <span class="v">=</span> has been improved.  Formerly, it 
 could fail to apply when certain <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> terms were in the context. 
 Thanks to Pete Manolios for bringing this problem to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>The command <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-BINOP.html">add-binop</a></span> failed to work.  This has been fixed.  Thanks 
 to Rob Sumners for pointing out this problem.  Also see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-OTHER.html">note-2-7-other</a> 
 for a discussion of how this and another <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> are no longer part of 
 the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Book certification could cause a segmentation fault in cases where the 
 certification world (see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>) has a very large number of 
 events.  This has been fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>We now allow empty <span class="v">:use</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> and empty hints, as requested by 
 Eric Smith.  Examples:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">("Goal" :use ())
("Goal")</pre> 
 
 <p>A large <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> nest could cause a stack overflow when 
 executing either <span class="v">:pr FN</span>, <span class="v">:pr! FN</span>, or <span class="v">:monitor (:definition FN)
 t</span>, where <span class="v">FN</span> is in that large mutual recursion nest.  This has been 
 fixed (implementation detail: function <span class="v">actual-props</span> has been made 
 tail-recursive).  NOTE: If you just want the definition of <span class="v">FN</span>, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PF.html">pf</a></span><span class="v"> FN</span> can be much faster than <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span><span class="v"> FN</span> if 
 <span class="v">FN</span> is in a large <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Hard Lisp errors could occur when including uncertified books.  This has 
 been fixed; ACL2 now does syntax-checking formerly omitted when including 
 uncertified books.</p> 
 
 <p>Previously, the evaluation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> 
 forms could cause ``undefined'' warnings when the form was compiled.  This has 
 been fixed.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bring a <span class="v">mutual-recursion</span> example to 
 our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug has been fixed in the syntactic check for valid <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a></span> values.  Formerly, valid <span class="v">:loop-stopper</span> values were 
 erroneously restricted to lists of length at most 2 (a minor problem, since 
 these lists typically have length 1), and the function symbol(s) need not have 
 been defined in the current ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  Thanks to Eric Smith for 
 sending an example to demonstrate the latter problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Functions definitions that are <span class="v">:non-executable</span> (see <a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a>) had 
 never been recognized as redundant, but this has been fixed.  Thanks to Vernon 
 Austel for pointing out this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Compilation using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span> now compiles user-defined <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions.  Formerly only <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode functions 
 could be compiled using <span class="v">:comp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Handling of <span class="v">:by</span> hints has been improved in essentially three ways. 
 The primary change is that now, when the current goal exactly matches the 
 supplied lemma instance, the subsumption test will always succeeds (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>, in particular the discussion of <span class="v">:by</span>).  Second, certain proof 
 failures involving <span class="v">:by</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> were failing silently, with duplicate 
 messages ``As indicated by the hint, this goal is subsumed by....''  This 
 could happen when the original goal was among the goals generated by applying 
 the hint.  This problem has been fixed by no longer considering this proof 
 step to be specious (see <a href="ACL2____SPECIOUS-SIMPLIFICATION.html">specious-simplification</a>).  Third and finally, 
 when the <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a> refers to a definition, the original body of 
 that definition is used rather than the simplified (``normalized'') body.</p> 
 
 <p>In addition to the above, we now recognize more cases of specious 
 simplification (see <a href="ACL2____SPECIOUS-SIMPLIFICATION.html">specious-simplification</a>).  Thanks to Eric Smith for 
 bringing this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed building of ACL2 under CLISP so that (1) the appropriate ACL2 startup 
 message is printed out when ACL2 starts up, and (2) the lisp process supplied 
 to make, e.g., LISP=/usr/bin/clisp, is the one written out to the saved ACL2 
 file.  Thanks to Dave Greve and Noah Friedman for suggesting (2).  Also, ACL2 
 now works with CLISP 2.30.  We have accommodated a change in CLISP's handling 
 of streams and its package-locking mechanism, as well as certain non-standard 
 characters that formerly could cause CLISP 2.30 to break, even when those 
 characters are in comments.</p> 
 
 <p>Eliminated compiler warnings for CMU Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed an incorrect error supplied when book certification proceeded so 
 quickly that the file write dates of the book (<span class="v">.lisp</span> file) and the 
 corresponding compiled file are equal.  Now that error only occurs if the 
 compiled file has a strictly earlier write date, which probably should never 
 happen.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed an infinite loop when executing <span class="v">make clean-books</span> (and hence 
 `make' with targets that call <span class="v">clean-books</span>, namely, 
 <span class="v">certify-books-fresh</span>, <span class="v">regression-fresh</span>, and 
 <span class="v">regression-nonstd-fresh</span>), which could occur when any subdirectories of 
 <span class="v">books/</span> are missing  even <span class="v">workshops/</span>, which is intended to be 
 optional.  Thanks to Pete Manolios for pointing out this bug.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> command now works properly even when filenames, or 
 their directories or parent directories (etc.) are links.  Thanks to Matt 
 Wilding for pointing out this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>The commands <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a></span> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PUFF_A2.html">puff*</a></span> have been fixed. 
 Formerly, there was a bug when <span class="v">:puff</span> or <span class="v">:puff*</span> caused the execution 
 of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> for an absolute <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>, <span class="v">P</span>, that was 
 other than the current connected book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>).  When 
 including <span class="v">P</span>, any subsidiary <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> with a relative pathname 
 would be erroneously considered relative to the current <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a></span> rather 
 than relative to the directory of <span class="v">P</span>.  Thanks to Pete Manolios and Matt 
 Wilding for pointing out this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>It had been possible in a ``large'' ACL2 image to call <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></span> successfully on built-in function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></span>, with 
 undesirable results.  This hole has been plugged.  Thanks to Rob Sumners for 
 pointing out this problem.  The new function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GC_42.html">gc$</a></span> must also stay in 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 no longer warns when certifying a book based on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> 
 functions whose <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s have not yet been verified.  Thanks to Pete 
 Manolios for pointing out this issue.</p> 
 
 <p>An occasional ``slow array warning'' had been possible during proofs.  The 
 following sequence shows how to evoke that warning in previous versions.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> binary-append))
(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> binary-append))
(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> binary-append))
(<a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a> 2)
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x y)) x))</pre> 
 
 <p>(See <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-OTHER.html">note-2-7-other</a> for a discussion of a change to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a></span> in support of this fix; however, users should not need to read that 
 discussion.)</p> 
 
 <p>The raw Lisp code for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> had a small bug, which was only 
 evidenced in CLISP implementations as far as we know.  It has been fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> is applied to a stringp file name, it now temporarily sets 
 the connected book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>) to the directory of that file 
 while evaluating forms in that file.  To see the effect of this change, 
 imagine a subdirectory <span class="v">"sub"</span> of the current directory, and imagine 
 executing <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> "sub/foo.lisp")</span>, where file <span class="v">foo.lisp</span> contains the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "bar")</span>.  Presumably the intention was to consider 
 the file <span class="v">bar.lisp</span> in the same directory, <span class="v">sub/</span>, as <span class="v">foo.lisp</span>. 
 <span class="v">Ld</span> now honors that intention, but in previous versions <span class="v">"bar.lisp"</span> 
 would have been a reference to a file in the current directory, not in 
 <span class="v">sub/</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>For users of <span class="v">run-acl2</span> [perhaps there are none!]: A fix has been 
 provided by a Debian user via Camm Maguire so that acl2-mode anyone using 
 that?] will work in Xemacs, which apparently uses variable 
 <span class="v">lisp-mode-shared-map</span> rather than <span class="v">shared-lisp-mode-map</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 has, for a long time (always?), had a mechanism for avoiding 
 re-proving <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s generated by <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>s in <span class="v">:use</span> and <span class="v">:by</span> hints.  But this mechanism had not 
 applied to defined (as opposed to constrained) functions.  This has been 
 fixed.  Thanks to Francisco J. Martin-Mateos (ChesKo) for pointing out this 
 problem by sending a clear example.</p>
