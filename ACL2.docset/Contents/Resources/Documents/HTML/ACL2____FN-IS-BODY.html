<p>Prove that a function called on its formals equals its body</p><pre class="code">General Form:

(<a href="ACL2____FN-IS-BODY.html">fn-is-body</a> fn &amp;key hints thm-name rule-classes)</pre> 
 
 <p>Evaluation of the form above generates a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event whose name is 
 <span class="v">thm-name</span> â€” by default, the result of adding the suffix "$IS-BODY" 
 to <span class="v">fn</span>, which is a function symbol.  To obtain that name 
 programmatically:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(fn-is-body-name 'foo)
FOO$IS-BODY
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>The formula of that <span class="v">defthm</span> event is of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (fn x1
 ... xn) &lt;body&gt;)</span>, where <span class="v">(x1 ... xn)</span> is the list of formal parameters of 
 <span class="v">fn</span> and <span class="v">&lt;body&gt;</span> is the un<a href="ACL2____NORMALIZE.html">normalize</a>d body of <span class="v">fn</span>.  If 
 <span class="v">:hints</span> or <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> are supplied, they will be attached to the 
 generated <span class="v">defthm</span> form.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the proof of the generated <span class="v">defthm</span> may not follow trivially 
 from the function's <span class="v">:</span><span class="v">definition</span> rule: by default, that rule is 
 derived from the function's <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZE.html">normalize</a>d body, which may differ from its 
 unnormalized body.</p>
