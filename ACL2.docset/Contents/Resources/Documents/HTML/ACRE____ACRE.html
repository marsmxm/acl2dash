<p>ACL2 Centaur Regular Expressions</p><p>ACRE is a regular expression package with features somewhat similar 
to Perl's regular expressions.</p> 
 
<p>Important note for writing regular expressions: the Common Lisp string 
reader treats backslashes as escape characters, so all backslashes in the parse 
tree below need to be escaped.  A good way to work around this is to use the 
<a href="ACL2____FANCY-STRING-READER.html">ACL2::fancy-string-reader</a> instead of regular double-quoted strings.  For 
example, to match a whitespace character (\s in regex syntax) followed by a 
backslash (\\ in regex syntax) followed by a double quote, you'd need to enter 
the following double-quoted string:</p> 
<pre class="code">"\\s\\\\\""</pre> 
<p>or the following \"fancy string\":</p> 
<pre class="code">#{"""\s\\""""} 
</pre> 
<p>If you print either of these out as follows, you'll see what the string's actual contents are:</p> 
<pre class="code">(cw "'~s0'~%" "\\s\\\\\"")       (prints '\s\\"') 
(cw "'~s0'~%" #{"""\s\\""""})    (prints '\s\\"') 
</pre> 
<p>So please either use fancy-strings or else keep in mind that, in regular 
double-quoted strings, any backslash in the following grammar must really be 
written as two backslashes.  It is best to debug your regular expressions by 
printing them out as above to avoid this sort of confusion.</p> 
 
<p>Here is the syntax for parsing regular expressions, and following it are descriptions of their semantics.</p>

<h3>API</h3> 
<p>The following types and functions make up the high-level regular expression API.</p> 
 
<h4>Types</h4> 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">regex-p</span> -- internal representation of regular expression patterns</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">matchresult-p</span> -- result of matching against a string</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h4>Functions</h4> 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACRE____PARSE.html">parse</a> pattern :legible t) --&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> err regex)</span> -- Pattern is a string; 
returns either an error or a regex.  If legible is nonnil (the default), then 
the pattern string is preprocessed before parsing in a way that allows patterns 
to be written more legibly: the preprocessing step removes non-escaped 
whitespace and removes comments consisting of the rest of the line after (and 
including) any non-escaped <span class="v">#</span> character.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACRE____MATCH-REGEX.html">match-regex</a> regex str :case-insens nil) --&gt; matchresult</span> -- Matches 
the given regex against str, using case insensitive matching if case-insens is 
set to nonnil.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACRE____PARSE-AND-MATCH-REGEX.html">parse-and-match-regex</a> pattern str :case-insens nil :legible t) --&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a>
err matchresult)</span> -- Combines <span class="v">parse</span> and <span class="v">match-regex</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACRE____MATCH.html">match</a> pattern str :case-insens nil :legible t) --&gt; matchresult</span> -- 
Macro which parses the given pattern into a regex at macroexpansion time, 
expanding to a call of <span class="v">match-regex</span> on the resulting regular expression. 
Any parse error becomes an error at macroexpansion time.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACRE____MATCHRESULT-_E3MATCHEDP.html">matchresult-&gt;matchedp</a> matchresult) --&gt; boolean</span> -- returns T if the 
regular expression matched the string and NIL otherwise.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACRE____MATCHRESULT-_E3MATCHED-SUBSTR.html">matchresult-&gt;matched-substr</a> matchresult) --&gt; substr-if-matched</span> -- 
returns the matched substring of the input string if there was a match, else 
NIL.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACRE____MATCHRESULT-_E3CAPTURED-SUBSTR.html">matchresult-&gt;captured-substr</a> name matchresult) --&gt; substr-if-matched</span> 
-- returns the substring that was captured by the given capture group, or NIL 
if the regex didn't match or the capture group was in part of the regex that 
didn't match. (As an example of the latter, consider matching the pattern 
"(aa)|bb" against the string "bb".)  <span class="v">Name</span> may be a positive number, 
which accesses capture groups by position, or a string, which accesses named 
capture groups (names are case sensitive).</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACRE____MATCHRESULT-_E3CAPTURED-SUBSTR_12.html">matchresult-&gt;captured-substr!</a> name matchresult) --&gt; substr</span> -- Same as 
the above, but simply returns the empty string if the above would return 
NIL.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h4>
<span class="v">B*</span> binders for capture groups</h4> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">((captures binding1 binding2 ...) matchresult)</span> binds variables to 
captured substrings from the given matchresult.  A binding may be simply a 
variable, in which case a positional capture group is accessed, or <span class="v">(var
name)</span>, in which case <span class="v">var</span> will be bound to the result of looking up the 
named capture group <span class="v">name</span>.  If a capture group doesn't exist, the variable 
is bound to NIL.  The <span class="v">captures!</span>  binding does the same thing but instead 
binds the variable to the empty string if the capture group doesn't exist.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">((named-captures binding1 binding2 ...) matchresult)</span> is similar to 
<span class="v">captures</span>, differing only when the binding is simply a variable.  Instead 
of getting a capture group by position, this looks up the downcase of the name 
of the variable.  <span class="v">Named-captures!</span> behaves analogously to 
<span class="v">captures!</span>.</li> 
 
</ul>
