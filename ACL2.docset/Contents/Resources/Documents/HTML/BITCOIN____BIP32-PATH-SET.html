<p>Osets of paths in key trees.</p><p>At any point in time, a system (e.g. wallet) contains 
     a relatively small subset 
     of the complete tree of possible keys derived from a root. 
     We represent the current tree as a finite set of paths 
     that satisfies additional conditions explicated later.</p>
