<p>Calculation of the ten base points used for the Pedersen hash.</p><p>The ten base points used for Semaphore's Pedersen hash were chosen in a 
  pseudorandom fashion.  In [Sema-Spec:5.3.2] these are called 
  <i>generators</i> and are denoted g_s for s in the set 
  \{0,..,9\}.</p><p>The description in [Sema-Spec:5.3.2] of how the base points were chosen 
  is not quite correct.  The input to \mathsf{Blake256} contains some 
  additional punctuation, and the padding function pads a decimal string 
  version of the number with the digit `0' (ascii 48).  We believe the correct 
  specification, checked against the 
  Javascript source and also independently duplicated in Python, is as follows.</p><blockquote>For each s, the generator g_s is computed as the first 
  successful attempt, when incrementally trying indices from i = 0, 
  at finding a \mathsf{BabyJubjub} point from a possible x coordinate calculated as <div class="mathfrag">\mathsf{Blake256(}\mathtt{"PedersenGenerator\_"}
   \ || \ \mathsf{decimalStringPadLeftZeros}(s,32)
   \ || \ \mathtt{"\_"}
   \ || \ \mathsf{decimalStringPadLeftZeros}(i,32))</div>with the 255th bit set to 0.</blockquote>
