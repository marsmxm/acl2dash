<p>A fast, <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>-free, <a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a>-mode re-implementation of 
much of ACL2's built-in pretty-printing capabilities.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>This is a two pass, linear time, "exact" pretty printer for ACL2 objects. 
My implementation is substantially based on the pretty-printing algorithm from 
ACL2 6.4, and offers many similar features.</p> 
 
<p>Why not just use ACL2's built-in pretty-printer?  As of ACL2 6.4, the 
built-in pretty-printer is a program-mode function that makes heavy use of 
<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>; it gets its configuration settings (margins, arithmetic base, 
etc.) out of state globals and does its printing via functions like <a href="ACL2____PRINC_42.html">princ$</a> which write to an output channel.  This can be inconvenient:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>You can't use ACL2's pretty-printer from logic-mode functions.</li> 
 
<li>You need <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> available any time you want to create a string using 
the printing functions.</li> 
 
<li>The printing routines are generally not thread-safe.</li> 
 
<li>Functions like <a href="ACL2____FMT-TO-STRING.html">fmt-to-string</a> aren't usable outside of the ACL2 
read-eval-print loop.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>My new pretty-printer has none of these problems.  Instead of incrementally 
printing to an output stream, it builds up a character list in reverse order, 
then reverses it with <a href="STR____RCHARS-TO-STRING.html">rchars-to-string</a>.  This uses more memory than 
ACL2's pretty printer, but the overhead is linear in the size of the output. 
Moreover, it appears to perform well---I measured it at about <b>5.5x 
faster</b> than ACL2's pretty printer on one <i>possibly</i> realistic 
benchmark; see <span class="v">std/strings/pretty-tests.lisp</span> for details.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Quick Start</h3> 
 
<p>The most convenient, high-level functions to use are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<a href="STR____PRETTY.html">pretty</a> - convert any ACL2 object into a string.</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="STR____REVAPPEND-PRETTY.html">revappend-pretty</a> - pretty print onto an accumulator, in reverse 
order, which is useful for building strings as described in <a href="STR____REVAPPEND-CHARS.html">revappend-chars</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>There are many available settings that you can tune to customize the way 
that objects are printed; see <a href="STR____PRINTCONFIG-P.html">printconfig-p</a> for details.  The defaults 
are sensible and are mostly compatible with the way that ACL2 normally prints 
things.</p> 
 
<p>We also implement our own <a href="STR____EVISCERATE.html">eviscerate</a>, which is more limited than 
ACL2's and does not, for instance, support <a href="ACL2____IPRINTING.html">ACL2::iprinting</a>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Limitations</h3> 
 
<p>I do not reimplement the format-string style functions such as <a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a> 
and <a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a>, although something like this is available as part of the <a href="VL____PRINTER.html">vl::printer</a>.  Instead, my focus here is on ACL2's <span class="v">ppr</span> functionality that 
is at the heart of ACL2's s-expression printing.  In other words, this is an 
implementation of something like the <span class="v">~x</span> <a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a> directive.</p> 
 
<p>Even with respect to <span class="v">ppr</span>, there is some <a href="STR____MISSING-FUNCTIONALITY.html">missing-functionality</a>. 
I don't implement <a href="ACL2____IPRINTING.html">ACL2::iprinting</a> or include any infix printing support. 
Various complex and unhelpful printer-control variables are also omitted.</p>
