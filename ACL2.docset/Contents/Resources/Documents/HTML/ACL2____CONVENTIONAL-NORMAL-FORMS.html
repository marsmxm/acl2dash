<p>Recommendations for respecting global conventions that the ACL2 books 
authors have agreed to.</p><p>In many cases there are alternate normal forms that you can use for 
the same concept.  For greater compatibility between libraries, we prefer to 
use various forms as described below.</p> 
 
<h4>Disable <a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a>
</h4> 
 
<p>Recommendations:</p> 
 
<ol> 
<li>Write lemmas in terms of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> n ...)</span> instead of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADDR.html">caddr</a> ...)</span>
</li> 
<li>Include the <span class="v">tools/mv-nth</span> book</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p>Rationale</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>It's important to have a standard here since multiply-valued functions 
are needed in many libraries.</li> 
 
<li>Leaving <span class="v">mv-nth</span> enabled is worse because it leads to different normal 
forms for slot 0 versus other slots.  That is, ACL2 will rewrite <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 0
...)</span>  to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> ...)</span> but will not rewrite <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 1 ...)</span> unless 
additional rewrite rules are added.</li> 
 
<li>Writing theorems in terms of <span class="v">mv-nth</span> is compatible with using <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> 
bindings in theorems, which is particularly nice.</li> 
 
</ul>
