<p>Create an induction scheme for a <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive function</p><p><span class="v">Definductor</span> is a utility provided as part of the community 
  book <span class="v">projects/apply/top</span>, which should be included in any session dealing 
  with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42-RECURSION.html">loop$-recursion</a></span>. 
  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFINDUCTOR.html">Definductor</a> fn)</span> attempts to create an induction scheme appropriate for 
  the previously defined <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive function <span class="v">fn</span> and prove an 
  <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INDUCTION.html">induction</a></span> rule so that certains calls of <span class="v">fn</span> suggest that 
  induction.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Warning:</b> <span class="v">Definductor</span> currently handles a very small class of 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions and may produce unhelpful error messages when 
  given a function name outside of that class!  We hope to improve it and this 
  documentation as we all get more experience with <span class="v">loop$</span>s and 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursion.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFINDUCTOR.html">definductor</a> copy-nat-tree)

(<a href="ACL2____DEFINDUCTOR.html">definductor</a> copy-nat-tree
             :measure (my-measure x)
             :hints (("Goal" :use ...)))

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFINDUCTOR.html">definductor</a> name &amp;key measure well-founded-relation ruler-extenders hints)</pre> 
 
  <p>where <span class="v">name</span> is the name of a previously admitted <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive 
  function satisfying the restrictions listed below.  When successful it 
  defines a function named <span class="v">name-INDUCTOR</span> that suggests an induction scheme 
  that is supposedly appropriate for <span class="v">name</span>, admits it with a silent proof 
  of its measure theorems, and then proves an <span class="v">:</span><span class="v">induction</span> rule to 
  associate that scheme with calls of <span class="v">name</span>.  When omitted, the optional 
  keyword arguments <span class="v">measure</span>, <span class="v">well-founded-relation</span>, and 
  <span class="v">ruler-extenders</span> default to the measure, well-founded relation, and 
  ruler-extender settings used in the admittance of <span class="v">name</span>.  The keyword 
  argument <span class="v">hints</span> defaults to <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
  <h3>Restrictions</h3> 
 
  <p>The given function, <span class="v">name</span>, must satisfy the following restrictions. 
  <b>Note:</b> Because we anticipate this utility being further developed in the 
  near future this list may not correspond to the latest implementation!</p> 
 
  <ul> 
 
  <li>
<span class="v">Name</span> must be a symbol naming a previously admitted <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive 
  function.</li> 
 
  <li>Every recursive <span class="v">loop$</span> in the body of <span class="v">name</span> -- that is, every 
  <span class="v">loop$</span> that calls <span class="v">name</span> recursively in the <span class="v">when</span>, <span class="v">until</span>, or 
  <span class="v">body</span> clauses of the <span class="v">loop$</span> -- must have as its target(s) distinct 
  measured variables or <span class="v">cdr</span>-nests around such variables.</li> 
 
  <li>Every recursive <span class="v">loop$</span> must use <span class="v">IN</span>-iteration, not <span class="v">ON</span>- or 
  <span class="v">FROM/TO/BY</span>-iteration.</li> 
 
  </ul> 
 
  <p>While <span class="v">definductor</span> can handle <span class="v">loop$</span> containing multiple <span class="v">AS</span> 
  clauses (with targets as described above), it cannot handle <span class="v">loop$</span> such 
  as</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a> for v in (target x) ...)
(<a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a> for v on x ...)
(<a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a> for i from 1 to max ...)</pre> 
 
  <p>To see the inductor function generated, type <span class="v">:pe name-INDUCTOR</span>.  To 
  see examples of the use of <span class="v">definductor</span> inspect the book 
  <span class="v">projects/apply/definductor-tests.lisp</span>.  To see the definition of 
  <span class="v">definductor</span>, see <span class="v">projects/apply/definductor.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>Suggestions for improvements are welcome!  We know of many, including 
  allowing the user to specify a different name for the inductor function, 
  improving the error messages, printing out the generated <span class="v">defun</span> in the 
  event of failure to admit it, and trying to expand the class of 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions that can be successfully handled.  We have not 
  yet even looked at inductions for <span class="v">ON</span> <span class="v">loop$</span>s and <span class="v">FROM/TO/BY</span> 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>s, so that might be easy.  Induction for <span class="v">loop$</span>s over arbtrary 
  target expressions may be infeasible!  We just need more examples of 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions and successful (hand-written) induction hints 
  for them.</p>
