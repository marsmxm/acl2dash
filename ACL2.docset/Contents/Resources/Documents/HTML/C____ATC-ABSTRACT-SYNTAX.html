<p>An abstract syntax of C for ATC.</p><p>ATC generates C code by 
     generating abstract syntax trees 
     and pretty-printing them. 
     Here we define the C abstract syntax whose trees are generated by ATC.</p><p>This is not necessarily meant to be a complete abstract syntax of C. 
     It only needs to represent the C programs that ATC generates, 
     not all the possible C programs.</p><p>At the same time, we plan to formalize 
     a more comprehensive abstract syntax of C 
     as part of our <a href="C____LANGUAGE.html">C language formalization</a>. As we do that, we may replace parts of this ATC abstract syntax 
     with (uses of) that more comprehensive one. 
     However, due to C's preprocessing features, it is possible that 
     there will always be some differences between 
     this ATC abstract syntax and the more comprehensive one. 
     The reason is that eventually we may want the ATC abstract syntax 
     to represent at least some of the preprocessing constructs, 
     such as <span class="v">#include</span>s, and possibly also some (simple) macros. 
     This means that the ATC abstract syntax will have to mix 
     preprocessing constructs with the preprocessed constructs: 
     this is something that may not be part, in this mixed form, 
     of the language formalization, 
     which should presumably differentiate between 
     preprocessing translation units and 
     (preprocessed) translation units. 
     In addition, we might want ATC to generate certain comments in the code, 
     which would require the ATC abstract syntax to incorporate 
     some information about comments. 
     However, in the language formalization, 
     comments, and their removal during one of C's translation phases, 
     would be captured differently, 
     presumably not as part of the abstract syntax 
     over which the language semantics is defined. 
     These are preliminary ideas, which will be refined, 
     and possibly revised, as more of ATC and of the language formalization 
     are developed.</p>
