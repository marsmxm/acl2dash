<p>What questions to ask at key checkpoints</p><p>We assume you've read about rewrite rules; see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-REWRITE-RULES-PART-1.html">introduction-to-rewrite-rules-part-1</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When a proof attempt fails, ACL2 prints some <i>key checkpoints</i>.  These 
 are formulas that we think you should look at.  There are two kinds printed: 
 key checkpoints <i>before an induction</i>, and key checkpoints <i>under a 
 top-level induction</i>.  (Key checkpoints under deeper inductions and 
 checkpoints that aren't considered ``key'' may exist in the proof attempt, but 
 ACL2 doesn't print them at the end of failed proofs because you shouldn't be 
 distracted by them.)</p> 
 
 <p>Below is a list of questions to ask yourself about the key checkpoints. 
 Initially, we recommend just picking one key checkpoint <i>before</i> an 
 induction (perhaps the simplest looking one) and asking these questions. 
 These questions may lead you to look at other key checkpoints.  As you gain 
 more experience you'll elaborate and generalize this advice.</p> 
 
 <p><b>(1) Do you believe this formula is a theorem?</b> If you don't think it 
 is, it's pointless to try to prove it!  You should reconsider your top-level 
 formula in light of the special case suggested by this key checkpoint.</p> 
 
 <p><b>(2) Can it be simplified?</b> Is there some combination of function 
 symbols in it that could be eliminated or simplified by exploiting some 
 simpler fact?  By a ``simpler fact'' we mean a theorem about a few of the 
 symbols in this formula.  For an example of this see <a href="ACL2____DEALING-WITH-KEY-COMBINATIONS-OF-FUNCTION-SYMBOLS.html">dealing-with-key-combinations-of-function-symbols</a>.  Don't think about the 
 deep question ``how can I prove the checkpoint?'' until you've got it into its 
 simplest form.</p> 
 
 <p><b>(3) Is the simpler fact already in the database?</b> If there is some 
 simpler fact that would help clean up the checkpoint but you believe the 
 simpler fact is already in the database, you can use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PBT.html">pbt</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>, 
 and other <i>history</i> commands to inspect the database; (see <a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a> 
 <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>).  But if you find the allegedly relevant simpler 
 fact in the database, you must ask: <b>why wasn't it used?</b> There are four 
 principal reasons:</p> 
 
 <p>(3a) it is disabled — so enable it; you'll learn how when you read 
 the coming sections on <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-DATABASE.html">introduction-to-the-database</a> and <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-HINTS.html">introduction-to-hints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(3b) its left-hand side doesn't match the target — so improve the 
 rule by generalizing its left-hand side or prove a new rule for this 
 situation; if you decide to remove the old rule from the database, see 
 <i>undo</i> commands in <a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(3c) it is an <span class="v">IFF</span> rule but the target doesn't occur propositionally 
 — so see if you you can strengthen the rule to an <span class="v">EQUAL</span> rule or 
 weaken the context of the target by changing the conjecture to use the target 
 propositionally; if you decide to remove the old rule from the database, see 
 <i>undo</i> commands in <a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(3d) the hypotheses of the rule cannot be relieved for this occurrence of 
 the target; this can be caused by the rule's hypotheses being too strong 
 (requiring more than they should), or by the hypotheses of the current 
 conjecture being too weak (you forgot some key hypothesis), or by ACL2 not 
 having the rules it needs to prove that the conjecture's hypotheses really do 
 imply the rule's.  Tools are available (<span class="v">:</span>see <a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>) 
 help you figure out why the rule failed, so use them and improve the rule, or 
 the current conjecture, or the database as appropriate.</p> 
 
 <p><b>(4) If the simpler fact is not already known, prove it.</b> This means 
 you must create a new <span class="v">defthm</span> event with appropriate <i>rule-classes</i> 
 to store your new theorem so that it will be used.  See <a href="ACL2____DEALING-WITH-KEY-COMBINATIONS-OF-FUNCTION-SYMBOLS.html">dealing-with-key-combinations-of-function-symbols</a>.  Then you must start using 
 The Method recursively to prove your new lemma.</p> 
 
 <p><b>(5) Otherwise, is this formula something you'd prove by induction?</b> 
 If you can't simplify it, it may be because you ``need this fact to prove this 
 fact,'' in which case, induction is the right thing to do.  But first, 
 remember that in order for a formulas to be provable by induction, it must be 
 very general.  Why must it be general?  Because in an inductive proof, the 
 main thing you have to work with is the induction hypothesis, which is an 
 instance of the theorem you're proving.  If the theorem is not general enough, 
 you won't be able to assume an instance that will help you.  ACL2 may try 
 induction even on formulas that are not general enough.  Don't assume that the 
 formula is ripe for induction just because ACL2 found an induction to do! 
 Before you ``approve'' a formula for induction, ask whether it is perhaps a 
 special case of some more general theorem.  See <a href="ACL2____GENERALIZING-KEY-CHECKPOINTS.html">generalizing-key-checkpoints</a> now and then come back here.  If you found a 
 generalization, you should probably be proving that formula instead of this 
 one.  So formulate the appropriate <span class="v">defthm</span> and use The Method recursively 
 to prove it.</p> 
 
 <p><b>(6) If the formula is right for induction, did ACL2 do an induction for 
 it?</b> You can answer that without looking at the proof.  Just see if there 
 are any key checkpoints after induction.  If not, why didn't ACL2 induct? 
 Perhaps you told ACL2 not to induct!  Perhaps no term in the conjecture 
 suggests an appropriate induction?  You could remedy this by extending ACL2's 
 induction analysis by adding to the database.  Or you could just tell ACL2 
 what induction to do for this formula.  You'll learn about both later (when 
 you read coming sections of the tutorial).</p> 
 
 <p><b>(7) If ACL2 did do an induction, was it the right one?</b> You can find 
 the induction scheme used by reading the first induction message in the output 
 log after you submitted the conjecture to ACL2.  But most often you will 
 realize the ``wrong'' induction was done just by looking at the post-induction 
 key checkpoints, keeping in mind that each is supposed to be a natural special 
 case of the theorem you're proving.  Is the case analysis inappropriate?  Are 
 induction hypotheses missing?  If so, you should look at the induction scheme. 
 If you determine the wrong induction was done, extend ACL2's induction 
 analysis or tell it which induction to do, which you'll learn about in the 
 coming sections of the tutorial.  For more advice about looking at 
 post-induction key checkpoints, see <a href="ACL2____POST-INDUCTION-KEY-CHECKPOINTS.html">post-induction-key-checkpoints</a> now 
 and then come back here.</p> 
 
 <p><b>(8) If the post-induction key checkpoints seems plausible,</b> <b>then 
 repeat the questions above for each one of them,</b> <b>perhaps starting with 
 the simplest.</b></p> 
 
 <p>In any case, after successfully taking whatever action you've decided on, 
 e.g., proving some new lemma and adding it as a rule:</p> 
 
 <p><b>Start over trying to prove your main conjecture.</b> This is important! 
 Do not just scroll back to the key checkpoints generated the last time you 
 tried to prove it.  Instead, re-generate them in the context of your new, 
 improved database and hints.</p> 
 
 <p>You will be following this general outline almost all of the time that 
 you're interacting with ACL2.  You will not often be asking ``Why is ACL2 
 making me think about this subgoal?  What did ACL2 do to get here?  How does 
 ACL2 work?''</p> 
 
 <p>Two other ideas are helpful to keep in mind.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Is a key checkpoint unexpectedly complicated?</b> Pay special attention 
 to the case where the complication seems to be the introduction of low-level 
 details you thought you'd dealt with or by the introduction of symbols you 
 didn't expect to see in this proof.  These can be signs that you ought to 
 disable some rules in the database (e.g., a definition of a complicated 
 function about which you've proved all the necessary lemmas or some lemma that 
 transforms the problem as was appropriate for some other proof).</p> 
 
 <p><b>Does the theorem prover just hang up, printing nothing?</b> If this 
 happens, you must interrupt it.  How you interrupt the prover is dependent on 
 which Common Lisp and which interface you're using.  But most Common Lisps 
 treat control-c as a console interrupt.  If you're in Emacs running ACL2 as a 
 shell process, you must type control-c control-c.  If you're in ACL2s, hit the 
 <i>Interrupt Session</i> button.  Interrupting ACL2 can leave you in an 
 interactive loop similar in appearance but different from ACL2's top-level! 
 So pay careful attention to the prompt and see <a href="ACL2____BREAKS.html">breaks</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Once you've regained control from the ``runaway'' theorem prover, there are 
 several tools you can use to find out what it is doing in real-time. 
 Generally speaking, when the theorem prover goes silent for a very long time 
 it is either in some kind of rewrite loop caused by rules that cause it to 
 flip back and forth between various supposedly normal forms, or else it has 
 split the problem into a huge number of cases and suffering a combinatoric 
 explosion.  See <a href="ACL2____DMR.html">dmr</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 and, perhaps, see <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.</p>
