<p>How to decide where in the books directory structure to place your book</p><p>Here is our loose view of the books organization:</p> 
 
  <ol> 
    <li>project-specific stuff</li> 
    <li>useful libraries not yet vetted by the 'std' maintainers</li> 
    <li>libraries 'approved' for the standard approach</li> 
  </ol> 
 
  <p>Books in category (1) easily belong in <span class="v">books/projects</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>Books in category (2) can go in the top-level <span class="v">books</span> directory or in 
  projects.  There's so much stuff in the top-level directory, that we suggest 
  <span class="v">books/projects</span> -- especially for people that are new to the ACL2 
  community.</p> 
 
  <p>Once general-use books are vetted by the ACL2 book Czars, they go in the 
  <span class="v">std</span> directory.  Some of the criteria the book czars use to decide 
  whether a book should be in <span class="v">std</span> follow below:</p> 
 
  <ul> 
    <li>Design is consistent with other <span class="v">std</span> books</li> 
    <li>Has some general purpose use -- e.g., data structure books are very 
    much something that you would expect to see in a general framework for a 
    language like Java</li> 
    <li>Has good documentation that explains how to use it</li> 
  </ul>
