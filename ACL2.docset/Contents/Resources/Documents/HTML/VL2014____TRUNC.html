<p>Eliminate implicit truncations in assignments</p><p>This transformation must occur after expression splitting has 
already been applied.  Recall that the <a href="VL2014____SPLIT.html">split</a> transformation brings 
all assignments into one of the following forms:</p> 
 
<ol> 
 <li><span class="v">lvalue = atom</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">lvalue = (op atom1 atom2 ... atomN)</span></li> 
</ol> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, Verilog allows for implicit truncations during assignments, 
so that the lvalue's width might be less than the operation's width.  (The 
other case is that the widths agree, since the lvalue plays a role in the 
ctxsize computation, and so if the lvalue's width is larger than the 
expression's, the expression will be expanded to match.</p> 
 
<p>And so we now introduce a rewrite which corrects for this, and results in 
assignments where the expressions always agree on the desired sizes.  The basic 
transformation is as follows.  We are looking at the assignment <span class="v">lvalue =
expr</span>.  If <span class="v">lvalue</span> is shorter than <span class="v">expr</span>, we replace this assignment 
with something like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire [expr.width-1:0] trunc_12345;
assign trunc_12345 = expr;
assign lvalue = trunc_12345[lvalue.width-1:0];</pre> 
 
<p>where <span class="v">trunc_12345</span> is a fresh variable name.  All of the resulting 
assignments are between lvalues and expressions that agree.</p>
