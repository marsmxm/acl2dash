<p><i>Books</i> are files of ACL2 <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>—they are the main 
way to split up large ACL2 developments into separate modules.</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic is about ACL2 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code" target="_blank"><nobr>source code<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code"></nobr></a> files. 
 However, there are also <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-papers.html#Books" target="_blank"><nobr>traditional, 
 paper books<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-papers.html#Books"></nobr></a> published about ACL2 and its applications.</p> 
 
 <p>You will almost surely want to organize your own ACL2 work into books. 
 They facilitate reuse, allow you to reload proofs more quickly, allow you to 
 rebuild parts of your proof in parallel, and so forth.  You will also want to 
 be aware of the many <i>community books</i>, which provide useful tools and 
 lemmas to build upon.  See <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> for more information, 
 including how to contribute.</p> 
 
 <h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
 <p>A <b>book</b> is a file of ACL2 forms.  Books are prepared entirely by the 
 user of the system, i.e., they are <i>source files</i> not <i>object 
 files</i>.  Some of the forms in a book are marked <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> and the 
 others are considered ``non-local.''</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">Include-book</a></span> lets you load a book into any ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  A 
 successful <span class="v">include-book</span> extends the logic of the host <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> by 
 adding just the non-local <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in the book.  Ordinarily, you might 
 include a variety of books to load all of their definitions and rules.</p> 
 
 <p>Successful book inclusion is consistency preserving, provided that the book 
 itself is consistent, as discussed later.  However, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 assumes the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in a book are valid, so if you include a book that 
 contains an inconsistency (e.g., an inadmissible definition) then the 
 resulting theory is inconsistent!</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></span> lets you <i>certify</i> a book to guarantee that its 
 successful inclusion is consistency preserving.  During certification, both 
 the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> and non-local forms are processed.  This lets you mark as 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> any <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> you need for certification, but that you want 
 to hide from users of the book—e.g., the hacks, crocks, and kludges on 
 the way to a good set of <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules.</p> 
 
 <p>Certification can also <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compile</a> a book 
 to speed up the execution of the functions defined within it.  The desire to 
 compile books is largely responsible for the restrictions we put on the forms 
 allowed in books.</p> 
 
 <p>Extensive <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> is available on the various aspects of 
 books.  We recommend that you read it all before using books.  It has been 
 written so as to make sense when read in a certain linear sequence, called the 
 ``guided tour'', though in general you may browse through it randomly.  If you 
 are on the guided tour, you should next read <a href="ACL2____BOOK-EXAMPLE.html">book-example</a>.</p>
