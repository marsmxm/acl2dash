<p>Representation of a single variable or net (e.g., wire) declaration.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name — <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Name of the variable being declared.</dd> 
 
<dt>loc — <a href="VL____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Where the declaration was found in the source code.</dd> 
 
<dt>type — <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE.html">vl-datatype</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Data type, array dimensions.  See below.</dd> 
 
<dt>nettype — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-NETTYPENAME.html">vl-maybe-nettypename</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Net type (i.e., resolution function, distinct from datatype) or 
              <span class="v">nil</span> if this a <span class="v">reg</span> or variable instead of a net.  See 
              below.</dd> 
 
<dt>atts — <a href="VL____VL-ATTS.html">vl-atts</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Any attributes associated with this declaration.</dd> 
 
<dt>initval — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-RHS.html">vl-maybe-rhs</a>
</dt> 
<dd>(Variables only).  When present, indicates the initial value for 
              the variable, e.g., for <span class="v">integer i = 3;</span> the <span class="v">initval</span> will 
              be the <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-P.html">vl-expr-p</a> for <span class="v">3</span>.  Note that when net 
              declarations have initial values, the parser turns them into 
              separate continuous assignment statements, instead.</dd> 
 
<dt>constp — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>(Variables only).  Indicates whether the <span class="v">const</span> keyword was 
              provided.</dd> 
 
<dt>constval — <a href="SV____MAYBE-4VEC.html">sv::maybe-4vec</a>
</dt> 
<dd>If the <span class="v">const</span> keyword was given, we try and resolve the ~ 
              <span class="v">initval</span> to a constant.  If successful, we store that value ~ 
              here.</dd> 
 
<dt>varp — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>(Variables only).  Indicates whether the <span class="v">var</span> keyword was 
              provided.</dd> 
 
<dt>lifetime — <a href="VL____VL-LIFETIME-P.html">vl-lifetime-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>(Variables only).  See SystemVerilog-2012 Section 6.21.  There 
              are pretty complex rules for variable lifetimes.  BOZO we don't 
              really support this yet in any meaningful way, and the 
              <span class="v">lifetime</span> field is currently just used to record whether a 
              <span class="v">static</span> or <span class="v">automatic</span> keyword was found during parsing.</dd> 
 
<dt>vectoredp — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>(Nets only) True if the <span class="v">vectored</span> keyword was explicitly 
                provided.  See SystemVerilog-2012 section 6.9.2.  This flag is 
                rather obscure and appears to have something to do with whether 
                the net will be ``expanded'' for the purposes of the Verilog 
                Programming Language Interface (PLI).  Vectored nets should 
                apparently not be bit- or part-selected from and should not 
                have strengths.  This does not seem particularly relevant to 
                anything and VL generally ignores this flag.</dd> 
 
<dt>scalaredp — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>(Nets only) True if the <span class="v">scalared</span> keyword was explicitly 
                provided.  See SystemVerilog-2012 section 6.9.2.  Again this is 
                not well specified and probably irrelevant.  VL generally 
                ignores this.</dd> 
 
<dt>delay — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-GATEDELAY.html">vl-maybe-gatedelay</a>
</dt> 
<dd>(Nets only) The delay associated with this wire, if any. 
                For instance, <span class="v">wire #1 foo</span> has a delay of 1, and means that 
                it takes 1 time unit for the net to change its value in 
                response to a change on any driver (Verilog-2005, 7.14).  The 
                default delay is zero when no delay is specified, but we 
                represent the delay using a <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-GATEDELAY-P.html">vl-maybe-gatedelay-p</a>, and 
                use <span class="v">NIL</span> when no delay is specified.  Note per 
                Verilog-2005, Section 6.1.3, that when a delays is provided in 
                the combined declaration and assignment statement like <span class="v">wire
                #10 a = 1, b = 2</span>, then the delay is associated with each 
                assignment and <b>not</b> with the net declaration for <span class="v">a</span>; 
                see <a href="VL____VL-ASSIGN-P.html">vl-assign-p</a> for more information.</dd> 
 
<dt>cstrength — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-CSTRENGTH.html">vl-maybe-cstrength</a>
</dt> 
<dd>(Trireg nets only).  The charge strength associated with the 
                net, if any.  For instance, <span class="v">trireg medium foo</span> will have a 
                <span class="v">cstrength</span> of <span class="v">medium</span>; the <span class="v">cstrength</span> will be 
                <span class="v">nil</span> for all non-trireg nets, regs, and variables; it will 
                also be <span class="v">nil</span> for <span class="v">trireg</span> nets that do not explicitly 
                give a charge strength.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 distinguish between nets and 
         variables.  For example:</p> 
 
         <pre class="code">wire signed [4:0] w;     // net
supply1 vdd;             // net
wand [3:0] a;            // net

reg [4:0] r;             // variable
logic signed [1:0] l;    // variable
integer i;               // variable
mybus_t b;               // variable</pre> 
 
         <p>In early versions of VL, we also separated nets from variables in 
         our internal representation of Verilog <a href="VL____SYNTAX.html">syntax</a>.  However, we 
         eventually decided that merging together these concepts into a single 
         representation would be simpler.  Today, we use the same 
         <span class="v">vl-vardecl</span> structures to represent:</p> 
 
         <ul> 
         <li>
<span class="v">net</span> declarations,</li> 
         <li>
<span class="v">reg</span> declarations, and</li> 
         <li>all other variable declarations (e.g., <span class="v">logic</span>, 
         <span class="v">mystruct_t</span>, etc.)</li> 
         </ul> 
 
         <p>Any of these declarations introduces a named entity that has 
         certain properties.  Some of these properties, like its dimension(s) 
         and whether it is regarded as signed, are captured by the notion of a 
         SystemVerilog <b>variable type</b> or <b>data type</b>.  We represent 
         this information as an ordinary <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE.html">vl-datatype</a>, found in the 
         <span class="v">type</span> field of the <span class="v">vl-vardecl</span>.</p> 
 
         <p>The main difference between nets and datatypes is that nets can be 
         used with multiple drivers.  To support resolving multiple drivers in 
         different ways, net declarations can include a <b>net type</b> such as 
         <span class="v">wire</span> for plain wires, <span class="v">wor</span> for a wired or, <span class="v">supply0</span> for a 
         <i>ground</i> wire, and similar.  Despite its name, the ``net type'' 
         has nothing to do with the ordinary notion of a data type!  (This 
         terminology, unfortunately, comes from the Verilog/SystemVerilog 
         standards; see for instance SystemVerilog-2012 section 6.5).</p> 
 
         <p>Here are some examples of basic net declarations.</p> 
 
         <pre class="code">module m (a, b, c) ;
  wire [4:0] w ;       // &lt;-- plain net declaration
  wire ab = a &amp; b ;    // &lt;-- net declaration with assignment
  ...
endmodule</pre> 
 
         <p>Net declarations can also arise from using the combined form of 
         port declarations.</p> 
 
         <pre class="code">module m (a, b, c) ;
  input wire a;    // &lt;-- net declaration in a port declaration
  ...
endmodule</pre> 
 
         <p>They can also arise from the more modern ANSI style ports, e.g.,</p> 
 
         <pre class="code">module m (input wire a, ...) ;</pre> 
 
         <p>You can also string together net declarations, e.g., by writing 
         <span class="v">wire w1, w2;</span>.  In all of these cases, our <a href="VL____PARSER.html">parser</a> generates 
         a separate <span class="v">vl-vardecl-p</span> object for each declared wire.  When an 
         assignment is also present, the parser creates a corresponding, 
         separate <a href="VL____VL-ASSIGN-P.html">vl-assign-p</a> object to contain the assignment.  Hence, 
         each <span class="v">vl-vardecl-p</span> really and truly only represents a single 
         declaration.  Similarly, combined variable declarations such as 
         "integer a, b" are split apart into multiple, individual 
         declarations.</p>
