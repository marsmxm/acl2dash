<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12">Click for Add-include-book-dir! in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>ly link keyword for <span class="v">:dir</span> argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> 
and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span></p><p>Please see <a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a>, which has completely 
 analogous syntax and semantics, except that <span class="v">add-include-book-dir!</span> is not 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> or the book in which it occurs. 
 Probably <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a></span> is to be preferred unless you have a 
 good reason for wanting to export the effect of this event outside the 
 enclosing <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> or book.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> 
 but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded.</p> 
 
 <p>This macro is essentially a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span> event that updates the table 
 <span class="v">include-book-dir!-table</span>, which associates keywords with absolute 
 pathnames.  However, as with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a></span>, direct table 
 updates are disallowed; you must use <span class="v">add-include-book-dir!</span> to add to the 
 table and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">delete-include-book-dir!</a></span> to remove from the table.</p> 
 
 <p>It is illegal to call <span class="v">add-include-book-dir!</span> in a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> 
 context.  (If you are tempted to do that, consider using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a></span> instead.)  To understand this restriction, imagine a 
 book that contains the following sequence of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">add-include-book-dir!</a> :my-dir "path/to/BAD/dir")
(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">delete-include-book-dir!</a> :my-dir))
(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">add-include-book-dir!</a> :my-dir "path/to/GOOD/dir"))
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "foo" :dir :my-dir)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> f-def
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f x) x))</pre> 
 
 <p>During the first (proof) pass of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, the book 
 <span class="v">path/to/GOOD/dir/foo.lisp</span> will be included.  But on the second pass, the 
 book <span class="v">path/to/BAD/dir/foo.lisp</span> will be included.  Now imagine that the 
 ``good'' version contains the event <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) x)</span> but the ``bad'' 
 version instead contains the event <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> x))</span>.  Then we can 
 easily prove <span class="v">nil</span> from the theorem <span class="v">f-def</span>!  Although it is likely that 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> values could catch this error at <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> time, 
 we prefer not to rely on these for soundness.</p>
