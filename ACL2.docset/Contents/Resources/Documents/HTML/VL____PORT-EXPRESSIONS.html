<p>Recognizers and functions for working with well-formed port 
expressions.</p><p>Our <a href="VL____VL-PORT-P.html">vl-port-p</a> recognizer doesn't place any restrictions on a 
port's expression, except that it should satisfy <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-EXPR-P.html">vl-maybe-expr-p</a>.</p> 
 
<p>However, per Verilog-2005, Section 12.3.2, "the port reference for each 
port in the list of ports at the top of each module declaration can be one of 
the following:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>A simple identifier or escaped identifier</li> 
<li>A bit-select of a vector declared within the module</li> 
<li>A part-select of a vector declared within the module</li> 
<li>A concatenation of any of the above.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog-2012 presents identical rules in Section 23.2.2.1.</p> 
 
<p>Note that nested concatenations are not permitted under these rules, e.g., 
whereas <span class="v">.a({b,c,d})</span> is a valid port, <span class="v">.a({b,{c,d}})</span> is not.  Simple 
tests suggest that indeed none of Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, or VCS permits any 
nested concatenations here; see for instance <span class="v">failtest/port13.v</span>.</p> 
 
<p>We now introduce recognizers for the accepted expressions.</p> 
 
<p><u>Portexprs</u>.  We recognize the set of expressions described above with 
<a href="VL____VL-PORTEXPR-P.html">vl-portexpr-p</a>.  Note that this function only checks the basic shape of 
its argumentâ€”it doesn't check that the names are unique or valid or that 
indices are sensible or anything like that.</p> 
 
<p><u>Well-formed ports</u>.  We extend the idea of portexprs to check whole 
ports in <a href="VL____VL-PORT-WELLFORMED-P.html">vl-port-wellformed-p</a>.  This function accepts any interface 
ports or blank ports without complaint.  However, for any regular ports with 
regular expressions, it insists that the expression is a portexpr.</p> 
 
<p><u>Internalnames.</u> Given a valid portexpr, we can easily collect up the 
identifiers that occur within it.  The main function to do this for a portexpr 
is <a href="VL____VL-PORTEXPR-_E3INTERNALNAMES.html">vl-portexpr-&gt;internalnames</a>.</p>
