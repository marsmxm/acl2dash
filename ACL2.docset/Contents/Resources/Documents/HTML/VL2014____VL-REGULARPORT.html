<p>Representation of a single non-interface port.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name — <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>The "externally visible" name of this port, for use in named module 
          instances.  Usually it is best to avoid this; see below.</dd> 
 
<dt>expr — <a href="VL2014____VL-MAYBE-EXPR.html">vl-maybe-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>How the port is wired internally within the module.  Most of the time, 
          this is a simple identifier expression that is just <span class="v">name</span>.  But 
          it can also be more complex; see below.  The expression should be 
          <span class="v">nil</span> for interface ports.</dd> 
 
<dt>loc — <a href="VL2014____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Where this port came from in the Verilog source code.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>In Verilog-2005, ports are described in Section 12.3 of the 
standard.</p> 
 
<p>It is important to understand the difference between ports and port 
declarations.  We represent ports as <span class="v">vl-port</span> structures, whereas port 
declarations re represented as <a href="VL2014____VL-PORTDECL.html">vl-portdecl</a> structures.  It is easy to 
see the difference between ports and port declarations when modules are 
declared using the "non-ANSI" syntax.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module mod(a,b,c) ;  &lt;-- ports

  input [3:0] a;     &lt;-- port declarations (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> ports)
  input b;
  output c;

endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>It is less easy to see this difference when the more concise "ANSI" syntax 
is used:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module mod(
  input [3:0] a;   &lt;-- ports and port declarations, mixed together
  input b;
  output c;
) ;
   ...
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Regardless of which syntax is used, VL internally creates both ports and 
portdecls as separate structures.</p> 
 
<p>In most designs, there is a single port corresponding to each port 
declaration.  However, in general Verilog permits more complex ports.  Here is 
an example of a module where the ports have external names that are distinct 
from their internal wiring.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module mod (a, .b(<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a>), c[3:0], .d(c[7:4])) ;
  input a;
  input w;
  input [7:0] c;
  ...
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>In this example, the <span class="v">name</span>s of these ports would be, respectively: 
<span class="v">"a"</span>, <span class="v">"b"</span>, <span class="v">nil</span> (because the third port has no externally 
visible name), and <span class="v">"d"</span>.  Meanwhile, the first two ports are internally 
wired to <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">w</span>, respectively, while the third and fourth ports 
collectively specify the bits of <span class="v">c</span>.</p> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog-2012 extends ports in several ways, but most of these 
extensions (e.g., support for fancy data types) are related to the port 
declarations rather than the ports.  One place where the ports themselves 
<i>are</i> extended is for interface ports.  See <a href="VL2014____VL-PORT.html">vl-port</a>.</p>
