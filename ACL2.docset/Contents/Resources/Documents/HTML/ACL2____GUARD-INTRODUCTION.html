<p>Introduction to <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s in ACL2</p><p>Most users can probably profit by avoiding dealing with guards most 
 of the time.  If they seem to get in the way, they can be ``turned off'' using 
 the command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span> <span class="v">nil</span>; for more about this, 
 see <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>.  For more about guards in general, see <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The guard on a function symbol is a formula about the formals of the 
 function.  To see the guard on a function, use the keyword command 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ARGS.html">args</a></span>.  See <a href="ACL2____ARGS.html">args</a>.  To specify the guard on a function at 
 <span class="v">defun-time</span>, use the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span> <span class="v">xarg</span> (See <a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a>) or 
 <span class="v">type</span> declarations (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>).  The latter may be preferable if 
 you want the host Lisp compiler to use this information.</p> 
 
 <p>Guards can be seen as having either of two roles: (a) they are a 
 specification device allowing you to characterize the kinds of inputs a 
 function ``should'' have, or (b) they are an efficiency device allowing 
 logically defined functions to be executed directly in Common Lisp.  Briefly: 
 If the guards of a function definition are ``verified'' (see <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>), then the evaluation of a call of that function on arguments 
 satisfying its guard will have the following property:</p> 
 
 <blockquote><p>All subsequent function calls during that evaluation will be on 
 arguments satisfying the guard of the called function.</p></blockquote> 
 
 <p>The consequence of this fact for (a) is that your specification function is 
 well-formed, in the sense that the values returned by this function on 
 appropriate arguments only depend on the restrictions of the called functions 
 to their intended domains.  The consequence of this fact for (b) is that in 
 the ACL2 system, when a function whose guards have been verified is called on 
 arguments that satisfy its guard, then the raw lisp function defined by this 
 function's <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> event is used to evaluate the call.  Note however 
 that even when the user-supplied <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> is not used, ACL2 uses a 
 corresponding executable-counterpart function that generally performs, we 
 expect, nearly as well as submitted function; see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a> for 
 relevant background on these two functions.  See <a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a> to see how <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> can speed up both kinds of execution.</p> 
 
 <p>Let us turn next to the issue of the relationship between guards and 
 evaluation.  See <a href="ACL2____GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>.</p>
