<p>Operate on a global single-threaded object</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> for an introduction to single-threaded 
 objects.  Also see <a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> for additional background.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> macro is a relatively advanced utility that 
 allows stobjs to be accessed directly from the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  Examples 
 may be found in <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a> file 
 <span class="v">books/system/tests/with-global-stobj-input.lsp</span>; we draw heavily from them 
 below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Example Forms:

; Read-only form (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> 3)
(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st
  ;; body:
  (fld st))

; Updating form (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> 4; (returns state))
(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a>
  st ; bound stobj
  (st) ; output signature of body
  ;; body:
  (update-fld x st))

; Updating form (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> 4; returns (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> * * state st2))
(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a>
  st ; bound stobj
  (nil st nil state st2) ; output signature of body
  ;; body:
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((st (update-fld x st))
         (st2 (update-fld2 x st2)))
    (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> (fld st) st (fld st2) state st2)))</pre> 
 
 <p>In the forms above, we call <span class="v">st</span> the stobj that is ``bound by'' the 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call, and the ``body'' of the form is the last 
 argument.  The read-only form above, like all read-only forms, has a body that 
 does not return the stobj bound by the form.  Each updating form above 
 specifies an output signature as a list, which must contain the stobj bound by 
 the form, whose elements are all <span class="v">nil</span> (designating a non-stobj value) or a 
 stobj name.  That output signature reflects the result of the body; the entire 
 form does not return the bound stobj, but does return <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>, as 
 explained below.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">With-global-stobj</span> is a macro, and the example forms above expand as 
 follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:trans1 (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>The first illustrates that in the read-only form, the bound stobj, which is 
 <span class="v">st</span> in that example, is bound to its value in the <span class="v">user-stobj-alist</span> 
 field of the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  The second and third similarly bind the 
 stobj, <span class="v">st</span>, but then update that stobj according to the body of the 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call (its last argument) and then update the 
 <span class="v">user-stobj-alist</span> of the state with that stobj's resulting value.  You can 
 of course use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS1.html">trans1</a></span> in this way to see expansions of other 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> calls.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that ACL2 expects you to use <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span>, not its 
 expansions in terms of the <a href="ACL2____NON-EXECUTABLE.html">non-executable</a> functions 
 <span class="v">read-user-stobj-alist</span>, which accesses the bound stobj from the 
 user-stobj-alist of <span class="v">state</span>, and <span class="v">write-user-stobj-alist</span>, which 
 completes the write for updating <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> forms.  These are 
 defined as follows, in terms of the ACL2 state's user-stobj-alist field, which 
 maps stobj names to their values.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a> read-user-stobj-alist (st state)

 <p><span class="v">With-global-stobj</span> can be useful when you want a function to read or 
 write a stobj but you don't want to pass that stobj as a formal parameter.  As 
 long as you pass <span class="v">state</span> as a formal parameter, you can access the stobj 
 using <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>This topic is intended to be sufficient preparation for the use of 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span>.  Those who want to read more about design and 
 underlying theory are welcome to peruse the (long) ACL2 source code comments, 
 ``Essay on the Design of With-global-stobj'' and ``Essay on Correctness of 
 Evaluation with Stobjs''.</p> 
 
 <h3>More Examples</h3> 
 
 <p>As noted above, examples may be found in <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a> file 
 <span class="v">books/system/tests/with-global-stobj-input.lsp</span>.  Here we discuss some of 
 those examples.</p> 
 
 <p>Let us start by introducing a couple of stobjs.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st fld)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st2 fld2 :congruent-to st)</pre> 
 
 <p>Calls of <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> are illegal at the top level (as opposed to 
 occurrences in the bodies of a definition or a theorem).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st (fld st))</pre> 
 
 <p>One solution may be to use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TOP-LEVEL.html">top-level</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TOP-LEVEL.html">top-level</a> (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st (fld st)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Normally, however, <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> is used inside definition bodies. 
 Here we read and write the stobj, <span class="v">st</span>, directly from the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> rd0 (<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs state))
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st (fld st)))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> wr0 (x state)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs state))
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st (st) (update-fld x st)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Let's see these in action, first writing and then reading.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(wr0 2 state)
&lt;state&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(rd0 state)
2
ACL2 !&gt;(fld st)
2
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>We can use various stobj operations, even the rather fancy <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SWAP-STOBJS.html">swap-stobjs</a></span>, in the body of a <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call.  The following 
 events are admissible.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(update-fld 1 st)
(update-fld 2 st2)

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f3 (st2 state)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (st2 state)))
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a>
    st
    (st2 st)
    (<a href="ACL2____SWAP-STOBJS.html">swap-stobjs</a> st2 st)))

(f3 st2 state)

(<a href="ACL2____ASSERT-EVENT.html">assert-event</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (fld st) 2)
                   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (fld st2) 1)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The following function writes to both <span class="v">st</span> and <span class="v">st2</span> without passing 
 in either one (just <span class="v">state</span>).  Notice that the inner <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> 
 call has a body that returns the indicated values <span class="v">st</span> and <span class="v">st2</span>, but 
 since <span class="v">st2</span> is bound by the call, it is dropped before returning from the 
 call, and <span class="v">state</span> is added — which explains the list <span class="v">(st state)</span> 
 supplied to the outer call.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> write-global-st-st2 (fld fld2 state)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs state))
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st
    (st state)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((st (update-fld fld st)))
      (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st2
        (st st2)
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((st2 (update-fld fld2 st2)))
          (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> st st2))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Let's check that this works as expected.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(write-global-st-st2 'a 'b state)
&lt;state&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(fld st)
A
ACL2 !&gt;(fld st2)
B
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>We can also read both fields.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> read-global-st-st2 (<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs state))
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st
    (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st2
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (fld st) (fld st2)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then, continuing with the session above:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(read-global-st-st2 state)
(A B)
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>We can reason about <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> by reasoning about its 
 expansions.  Consider the following theorem (continuing the session 
 above).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> rd0-of-wr0
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (rd0 (wr0 val state))
         val))</pre> 
 
 <p>This fails to prove, but each of the two checkpoints has a term of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">ASSOC-EQUAL</a> 'ST (<a href="ACL2____PUT-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">PUT-ASSOC-EQUAL</a> 'ST _ _))</span>.  That suggests the following 
 lemma.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> assoc-equal-put-assoc-equal
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a> key (<a href="ACL2____PUT-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">put-assoc-equal</a> key val alist))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> key val)))</pre> 
 
 <p>This lemma proves automatically, after which <span class="v">rd0-of-wr0</span> proves 
 automatically.</p> 
 
 <h3>Syntax and Semantics</h3> 
 
 <p>This section provides a reference for <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span>.  The next 
 section discusses restrictions that avoid aliasing problems.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms:
; Read-only form (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> 3):
(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st form)
; Updating form (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> 4):
(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st lst form)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">st</span> is the name of a <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> that is user-defined 
 (i.e., not <span class="v">state</span>), <span class="v">form</span> is subject to syntactic restrictions 
 discussed below, and <span class="v">lst</span> is a list, sometimes called an ``output 
 signature''.  That list indicates the list of <span class="v">N</span> values returned by 
 <span class="v">form</span>, which must include the bound stobj, <span class="v">st</span>: thus <span class="v">lst</span> is 
 <span class="v">(st)</span> if <span class="v">N</span> is 1, indicating that <span class="v">form</span> returns an instance of 
 that stobj; and otherwise <span class="v">form</span> returns multiple values <span class="v">(x0 x1
 ... xk)</span> where <span class="v">k</span> is <span class="v">N-1</span> and for each <span class="v">i</span>, <span class="v">xi</span> is either 
 <span class="v">nil</span> if the <span class="v">i</span>th value is an ordinary value or else is the name of a 
 stobj returned in that position (and one such stobj name is the bound 
 stobj).</p> 
 
 <p>In each General Form above, <span class="v">st</span> and <span class="v">form</span> are called the ``bound 
 stobj'' and ``body'' of the <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call (respectively).</p> 
 
 <p>For the read-only form, the bound stobj (which is <span class="v">st</span> above) must not 
 be returned by the body of the form.</p> 
 
 <p>For the updating form, the values actually returned are obtained by 
 removing <span class="v">st</span> from <span class="v">lst</span> and then, if <span class="v">state</span> is not already in 
 <span class="v">lst</span>, adding <span class="v">state</span> at the end of <span class="v">lst</span>.  Consider the following 
 example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f0 (st2 state)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (st2 state)))
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a>
    st
    (st st2 nil state)
    (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> st st2 nil state)))</pre> 
 
 <p>In this case, <span class="v">lst</span> is <span class="v">(st st2 nil state)</span>, and the following 
 expansion shows that <span class="v">st</span> has been dropped from the returned values.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:trans1 (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a>
                 st
                 (st st2 nil state)
                 (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> st st2 nil state))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">LET</a> ((ST (READ-USER-STOBJ-ALIST 'ST STATE)))
      (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">MV-LET</a> (ST ST2 {WGS}0 STATE)
              (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">MV</a> ST ST2 NIL STATE)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">LET</a> ((<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">STATE</a> (WRITE-USER-STOBJ-ALIST 'ST ST STATE)))
                   (<a href="ACL2____MV_F3.html">MV?</a> ST2 {WGS}0 STATE))))
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Evaluation of an updating <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> form always 
 updates <span class="v">state</span>: specifically it updates its <span class="v">user-stobj-alist</span> field 
 (see <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>).  The following example is similar to the one above, except 
 that this time the body of the <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call does not return 
 state; nevertheless, the entire call does return state.  It illustrates that 
 when <span class="v">state</span> is not in the list given as the second argument of an updating 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call, then the <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> form not only 
 drops the bound stobj from its return values but also adds <span class="v">state</span> as the 
 last returned value (or, if the bound stobj was the sole symbol in the list, 
 then the call returns <span class="v">state</span> as the sole value).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:trans1 (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a>
                 st
                 (st st2 nil)
                 (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> st st2 nil))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">LET</a> ((ST (READ-USER-STOBJ-ALIST 'ST STATE)))
      (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">MV-LET</a> (ST ST2 {WGS}0)
              (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">MV</a> ST ST2 NIL)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">LET</a> ((<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">STATE</a> (WRITE-USER-STOBJ-ALIST 'ST ST STATE)))
                   (<a href="ACL2____MV_F3.html">MV?</a> ST2 {WGS}0 STATE))))
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that because <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> updates <span class="v">state</span>, then 
 <span class="v">state</span> must be a known stobj when <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> is called.  In 
 particular, in order to call <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> in the body of a function, 
 <span class="v">state</span> should be a formal parameter of that function.</p> 
 
 <h3>Syntactic Restrictions to Avoid Aliasing</h3> 
 
 <p>For the examples in this section, we continue to assume that the following 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> have been evaluated.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st fld)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st2 fld2 :congruent-to st)</pre> 
 
 <p>Consider the following definition.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (st state)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (st state)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st
                 (st)
                 (update-fld 3 st))))
    (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> (fld st) state)))</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 admits that form, but causes an error with the following call of 
 <span class="v">foo</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(foo st state)


ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  Illegal top-level form, (FOO ST STATE).
The stobj ST occurs free, yet may be bound by an updating WITH-GLOBAL-
STOBJ form, as the top-level form calls FOO, which makes an updating
WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ call that binds ST.  See :DOC with-global-stobj.

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Let us see why this call must be illegal; then we'll study the error 
 message.  The <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> form above will set the field, <span class="v">fld</span>, 
 of <span class="v">st</span> to the value, 3.  Moreover, ACL2 uses destructive update on stobjs: 
 the actual Lisp object representing <span class="v">st</span> has value 3 in its field, and this 
 is the same object for which we return <span class="v">(fld st)</span> from <span class="v">foo</span>.  So if 
 <span class="v">(foo st state)</span> were allowed to execute, it would return the multiple 
 values <span class="v">(3 &lt;state&gt;)</span>.  However, ACL2 can prove that ACL2 returns <span class="v">(fld

 <p>What we are seeing is a violation of single-threadedness.</p> 
 
 <p>Now let's look at the error message above.  It explains that ``the stobj ST 
 occurs free'' in <span class="v">(foo st state)</span>: indeed, <span class="v">st</span> is the first argument of 
 that call.  Therefore, <span class="v">st</span> can be accessed in that top-level form; indeed, 
 we have seen that it is returned as the first value.  However, <span class="v">st</span> can 
 also be destructively modified because of the updating <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> 
 call in the body of <span class="v">foo</span>: ``the top-level form calls FOO, which makes an 
 updating WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ call that binds ST.''  As we have discussed, that 
 updating call destroys single-threadedness, and hence must be avoided.  We may 
 call this an ``aliasing problem'', since the bound stobj shares structure with 
 the formal parameter.</p> 
 
 <p>By contrast, there is no such problem if we replace <span class="v">st</span> by its 
 congruent stobj, <span class="v">st2</span>, in the top-level call.</p>

 <p>In this case there is no aliasing problem.  The formal parameter <span class="v">st</span> of 
 <span class="v">foo</span> is bound to the (global) value of <span class="v">st2</span>, which does not share 
 structure with the (global) value of stobj <span class="v">st</span> that is updated by the 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> form.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the aliasing problem can be buried through a chain of function 
 calls, as we now illustrate.  Function <span class="v">foo2</span> is like <span class="v">foo</span> above, with 
 two changes: instead of updating the field with <span class="v">3</span> we update it with the 
 formal parameter, <span class="v">val</span>; and that update is done inside the called 
 function, <span class="v">foo2-sub</span>, rather than directly in the body of <span class="v">foo2</span>.</p>

 <p>The error message is essentially the same, except that the chain of calls 
 is shown that leads to the problematic updating <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> form. 
 The behavior on <span class="v">st2</span> instead of <span class="v">st</span> is fine, as before.</p>

ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  Illegal top-level form, (FOO2 3 ST STATE).
The stobj ST occurs free, yet may be bound by an updating WITH-GLOBAL-
STOBJ form, as the top-level form calls FOO2, which calls FOO2-SUB,

 <p>So far we have seen just one aliasing problem, i.e., between a free stobj 
 in a top-level form and a subsidiary updating <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> form. 
 Another case is where the free stobj in a top-level form is actually 
 returned (we might say, updated) by that form; in that case, any subsidiary 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> form is problematic, even if it is read-only.  Here is 
 an example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g2 (val st state)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (st state)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((st (update-fld val st)))
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((f (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st (fld st))))
      (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> f (fld st) st state))))

(g2 nil st state)</pre> 
 
 <p>As before, the definition is fine, but the ensuing top-level call is not. 
 And as before, if we replace the top-level stobj occurrence by one that is 
 congruent to <span class="v">st</span>, there is no error: <span class="v">(g2 5 st2 state)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that there is no aliasing problem when there is no update of the 
 stobj, either in the top-level form or in the subsidiary 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> form.  The following are perfectly legal, for 
 example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g1 (st state)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (st state)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((f (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st (fld st))))
    (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> f state (fld st))))

(g1 st state)</pre> 
 
 <p>So far we have seen two similar error cases due to aliasing: both are 
 top-level calls involving a stobj occurrence that has an occurrence below 
 bound by <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span>, where at least one of the two occurrences 
 updates the stobj.  Consider this: a top-level call like <span class="v">(foo st state)</span> 
 could be viewed as grabbing <span class="v">st</span> from the ACL2 state, hence could be viewed 
 as being <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st (foo st state))</span>.  So we can think of the 
 restrictions as being about nested <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> calls, and that 
 leads us to the final two cases.  Here is a summary of all the restrictions to 
 prevent aliasing, starting with the two discussed above about top-level 
 evaluation, and ending with the two new ones about nested 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> calls.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>In a form <span class="v">u</span> that is legal at the top-level, where <span class="v">u</span> has a free 
 occurrence of stobj <span class="v">st</span>, there is no updating <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call 
 that binds <span class="v">st</span> and is invoked during evaluation of <span class="v">u</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>In a form <span class="v">u</span> that is legal at the top-level, where <span class="v">u</span> returns 
 stobj <span class="v">st</span>, there is no <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call that binds <span class="v">st</span> and 
 is invoked during evaluation of <span class="v">u</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>In a form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st u)</span>, there is no 
 updating <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call that binds <span class="v">st</span> and is invoked during 
 evaluation of <span class="v">u</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>In an updating form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st lst u)</span>, there is no 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call that binds <span class="v">st</span> and is invoked during 
 evaluation of <span class="v">u</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Our restrictions that prevent aliasing are syntactic ones, sufficient to 
 prevent the invocations described above.  They are implemented by searching 
 for calls of <span class="v">read-user-stobj-alist</span> to identify expansions of 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> calls, and by searing for calls of 
 <span class="v">write-user-stobj-alist</span> to identify expansions of updating 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> calls.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we note that the syntactic restrictions extend to <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s. 
 Consider again the function <span class="v">rd0</span> as defined above, and let's use it in the 
 guard of a function.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> rd0 (<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs state))
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ.html">with-global-stobj</a> st (fld st)))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> call-rd0-in-guard (<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>)

                  :guard (rd0 state))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IGNORE.html">ignore</a> state))
  17)</pre> 
 
 <p>Then as before, it is an error for a top-level form to update <span class="v">st</span> and 
 also call a function that may lead to a <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call that binds 
 <span class="v">st</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((st (update-fld 3 st)))
         (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> st (call-rd0-in-guard state)))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">LET</a> ((ST (UPDATE-FLD 3 ST))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">LIST</a> ST (CALL-RD0-IN-GUARD STATE))).
The stobj ST is returned by evaluation of that form, yet is bound by
a WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ form, as the top-level form calls CALL-RD0-IN-GUARD,
which calls RD0, which makes a WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ call that binds ST.

 <h3>Constrained Functions and Defattach</h3> 
 
 <p>Consider the following constrained function introduction.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>

  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> crn0 (<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>)

           (state-p state))))</pre> 
 
 <p>If we try to attach <span class="v">rd0</span> (defined above) to <span class="v">crn0</span> we get an error, 
 as shown just below.  In short, this error says that since <span class="v">rd0</span> may lead 
 to a call of <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> that binds <span class="v">st</span>, then with this 
 attachment, <span class="v">crn0</span> may lead to such a call; yet there is no record in the 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> that <span class="v">crn0</span> may lead to such a call.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a> crn0 rd0)


ACL2 Error in ( DEFATTACH CRN0 RD0):  The attachment of RD0 to CRN0

CRN0.  But this restriction is violated for stobj ST:  the attempt
is to attach RD0, which makes a WITH-GLOBAL-STOBJ call that binds ST,
yet that stobj is not specified by the :GLOBAL-STOBJS keyword of CRN0.

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>The solution is to note, in the signature of the constrained function, that 
 it may lead to a <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call.  This is accomplished by using 
 the keyword, <span class="v">:GLOBAL-STOBJS</span>, in the signature of the function.  The value 
 of that keyword is <span class="v">nil</span> by default, indicating that there is no such call. 
 Otherwise the value is a cons of the form <span class="v">(r . w)</span>, where <span class="v">r</span> and 
 <span class="v">w</span> are disjoint lists of stobjs.  Their interpretation is as follows: 
 <span class="v">w</span> includes all stobjs for which an attachment may have an updating 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call, and <span class="v">r</span> includes all stobjs not in <span class="v">w</span> for 
 which an attachment may have a <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> call.  Consider the 
 following modification of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
  (((crn1 state) =&gt; * :global-stobjs ((st) . nil)))
  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> crn1 (<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs state))
           (state-p state))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a> crn1 rd0)</span> is legal: unlike <span class="v">crn0</span>, 
 <span class="v">crn1</span> has specified that <span class="v">st</span> may be bound by <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> in 
 an attachment.</p> 
 
 <p>The requirement is thus as follows.  Consider attachment of <span class="v">g</span> to a 
 constrained function <span class="v">f</span>, where <span class="v">g</span> may lead to updating 
 <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> calls that bind stobjs <span class="v">w1</span>, <span class="v">w2</span>, ..., <span class="v">wk</span>, 
 and also <span class="v">g</span> may lead to <span class="v">with-global-stobj</span> calls that bind, in 
 addition to the <span class="v">wi</span>, stobjs <span class="v">r1</span>, <span class="v">r2</span>, ..., <span class="v">rn</span>.  Then the 
 signature of <span class="v">f</span> must specify a value <span class="v">(r . w)</span> for the keyword 
 <span class="v">:GLOBAL-STOBJS</span>, where <span class="v">r</span> and <span class="v">w</span> are lists of stobjs such that: 
 <span class="v">w</span> includes all <span class="v">wi</span>, and the union of <span class="v">r</span> and <span class="v">w</span> includes all 
 <span class="v">ri</span>.</p>
