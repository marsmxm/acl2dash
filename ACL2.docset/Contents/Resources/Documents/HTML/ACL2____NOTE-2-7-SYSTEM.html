<p>ACL2 Version  2.7 Notes on System-level Changes</p><p>ACL2 now runs (once again) under LispWorks, specifically, LispWorks 
 4.2.0.  However, we needed a patch, which presumably will be unnecessary after 
 4.2.7.  From LispWorks support:</p> 
 
 <blockquote><p>Users with LispWorks4.2.7 should ask us at 
 lisp-support@xanalys.com for the transform-if-node patch. It will be helpful 
 if they quote (Lisp Support Call #11372) when doing so. Also, they must send a 
 bug form generated from their LispWorks image: instructions at 
 http://www.lispworks.com/support/bug-report.html.</p></blockquote> 
 
 <p>File <span class="v">books/Makefile-generic</span> has been improved so that failed attempts 
 to certify a book will cause the `make' to fail.  Previously, an existing 
 <span class="v">.cert</span> file was left in place, and that sufficed for the `make' to be 
 considered a success.  Now, the old <span class="v">.cert</span> file is first removed when 
 recertification is found to be necessary.</p> 
 
 <p>A change has been made to source file <span class="v">acl2.lisp</span> to accommodate GCL 
 2.4.3.  (ACL2 Version 2.6 does not work with some versions of GCL 2.4.3.)</p> 
 
 <p>The error message has been improved when certain forms are typed to raw 
 Lisp and the ACL2 loop has never been entered (with <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span><span class="v">)</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>The following symbols in the ACL2 package have been made untouchable, 
 meaning that they are not available to the user: <span class="v">ev-fncall</span>, <span class="v">ev</span>, 
 <span class="v">ev-lst</span>, <span class="v">ev-acl2-unwind-protect</span>, <span class="v">ev-fncall!</span>, and 
 <span class="v">user-stobj-alist-safe</span>.  The reason is that these functions can not be 
 called safely except under certain restrictions.  If you want to call the ACL2 
 evaluator, consider using the built-in system functions <span class="v">trans-eval</span> or 
 simple-translate-and-eval.</p> 
 
 <p>CLISP Version_2.30 implements a notion of ``locking'' the "LISP" package 
 that is incompatible with building ACL2.  (CLISP Version_2.27 does not appear 
 to have had this feature.)  We have gotten around this problem by unlocking 
 the "LISP" package in ACL2 images built on such CLISPs.</p> 
 
 <p>Automatic proclaiming for GCL, which has (for a long time) been done for 
 functions in compiled books, has been improved.  Formerly, the only time a 
 non-trivial output type (i.e., other than <span class="v">t</span>) was inferred was when 
 macroexpansion produced an explicit call of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a></span>.  Now, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> 
 expressions can also generate non-<span class="v">t</span> output types.  Consider the following 
 example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> the-fixnum (n)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'the '(signed-byte 29) n))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> 1+f (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'the-fixnum
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> '1+ (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'the-fixnum x))))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">type</a> (unsigned-byte 27) x))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> x)
      0
    (1+f (foo (1-f x)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Formerly, the <span class="v">proclaim</span> forms for <span class="v">foo</span>, before and after this 
 improvement, are as shown below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(PROCLAIM '(FTYPE (FUNCTION ((UNSIGNED-BYTE 27)) T) FOO))                ;old
(PROCLAIM '(FTYPE (FUNCTION ((UNSIGNED-BYTE 27)) (SIGNED-BYTE 29)) FOO)) ;new</pre> 
 
 <p>Compiler info messages sent to error stream were eliminated for CMUCL.</p>
