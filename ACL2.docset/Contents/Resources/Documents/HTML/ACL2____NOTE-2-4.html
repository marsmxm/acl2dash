<p>ACL2 Version  2.4 (August, 1999) Notes</p><p>Important changes:</p> 
 
 <p>We corrected a soundness bug in Version 2.3 related to the handling of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a></span>.  The bad behavior was noticed by Robert Krug. 
 Thanks!</p> 
 
 <p>We corrected a bug that permitted <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> to accept a 
 function even though a subfunction had not yet had its guards verified. 
 Thanks to John Cowles for noticing this.</p> 
 
 <p>User defined single-threaded objects are now supported.  See <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Less important notes:</p> 
 
 <p>We corrected a bug that prevented the intended expansion of some recursive 
 function calls.</p> 
 
 <p>We changed the handling of the primitive function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ILLEGAL.html">illegal</a></span>, which is 
 logically defined to be <span class="v">nil</span> but which is programmed to signal an error, 
 so that when it is evaluated as part of a proof, it does not signal an error. 
 The old handling of the function prevented some guard proofs involving <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>s with internal declarations.</p> 
 
 <p>We corrected a bug that permitted some <span class="v">LOCAL</span> <span class="v">DEFAXIOM</span> events to 
 slip into certified books.</p> 
 
 <p>We corrected a bug that prevented the correct undoing of certain 
 <span class="v">DEFPKG</span> forms.</p> 
 
 <p>Changes were made to support CMU Lisp.  Pete Manolios helped with these 
 changes.</p> 
 
 <p>Changes were made to make the make files more compatible with Allegro 
 Common Lisp.  Jun Sawada, who has been a great help with keeping ACL2 up and 
 running at UT on various platforms, was especially helpful.  Thanks Jun.</p>
