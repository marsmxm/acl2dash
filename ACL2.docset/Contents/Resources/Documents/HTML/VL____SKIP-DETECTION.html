<p>We try to detect missing signals from expressions.</p><p>Related wires often have similar names, e.g., in one module we 
found wires with names like <span class="v">bcL2RB0NoRtry_P</span>, <span class="v">bcL2RB1NoRtry_P</span>, and so 
on, up to <span class="v">bcL2RB7NoRtry_P</span>.  Such signals might sometimes be combined later 
on, e.g., we later found:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign bcL2NoRtry_P = bcL2RB7NoRtry_P | bcL2RB6NoRtry_P
                    | bcL2RB5NoRtry_P | bcL2RB4NoRtry_P
                    | bcL2RB3NoRtry_P | bcL2RB2NoRtry_P
                    | bcL2RB1NoRtry_P | bcL2RB0NoRtry_P;</pre> 
 
<p>Skip detection pertains to expressions like the above.  In short, it would 
be pretty odd if <span class="v">bcL2RB4NoRtry_P</span> been omitted ("skipped") in the above 
expression, or if say <span class="v">bcL2RB3NoRtry_P</span> occurred more than once.  We try to 
detect such situations.</p> 
 
<p>Note that some expressions might involve more than one group of these 
kind of signals.  For instance, we found:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign bcNxtWCBEntSrc_P =
   bcDataSrcLd_P ? ({3{bcWCB0DBSYQual_P}} &amp; bcWCB0Ent_P)
                 | ({3{bcWCB1DBSYQual_P}} &amp; bcWCB1Ent_P)
                 | ({3{bcWCB2DBSYQual_P}} &amp; bcWCB2Ent_P)
                 | ({3{bcWCB3DBSYQual_P}} &amp; bcWCB3Ent_P)
                 | ({3{bcWCB4DBSYQual_P}} &amp; bcWCB4Ent_P)
                 | ({3{bcWCB5DBSYQual_P}} &amp; bcWCB5Ent_P)
                 : bcWCBEntSrc_P;</pre> 
 
<p>We try to also detect skipped signals in these kinds of expressions.</p>
