<p>Functionally instantiate a pre-existing theorem to prove a new one.</p><p>Usage:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-FUNCTIONAL-INSTANCE.html">def-functional-instance</a> new-thm-name
  orig-thm-name
  ((orig-fn substitute-fn) ...)
  :hints (...)                   ;; optional
  :rule-classes rule-classes)    ;; optional</pre> 
 
<p>Def-functional-instance attempts to define a new theorem based on 
functionally instantiating an existing one with a user-provided function 
substitution.  It looks up the body of the theorem named ORIG-THM-NAME in the 
ACL2 world and applies the functional substitution, replacing each ORIG-FN with 
SUBSTITUTE-FN in the theorem body.  It then submits this as a new theorem named 
NEW-THM-NAME with a hint to prove it using a functional instance of the 
original theorem.  This theorem has either the given rule-classes or, if this 
argument is omitted, the rule-classes of the original theorem.</p> 
 
<p>Sometimes further hints are needed to show that the functional instantiation 
is valid.  These may be given by the :hints keyword.  Note, however, that there 
is already a hint provided at "goal", so that if one of the user-provided 
hints uses this as its subgoal specifier, this hint will be ignored.  The extra 
hints given should either be computed hints or reference later subgoals.</p>
