<p>Ways to address failed invocations of the <span class="v">simplify</span> transformation.</p><p>This topic suggests steps you may take to address failed 
 invocations of the <span class="v">simplify</span> transformation.</p> 
 
 <h3>Dealing with a guard verification failure</h3> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">(<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">simplify</a> FN ...)</span> fails at guard verification, then unless option 
 <span class="v">:print nil</span> is supplied, an attempt to run <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> fn)</span> will be 
 made automatically, with prover output shown as though <span class="v">:print :all</span> had 
 been supplied.  That way, you can look at checkpoints to come up with helpful 
 rules, without having to run <span class="v">simplify</span> again (see <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">ACL2::the-method</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Note that in some cases, there may be initial attempts at guard 
 verification that use a somewhat sophisticated <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">ACL2::proof-builder</a> 
 macro, one that users are not expected to understand.  This explains why the 
 retry mentioned above is simply <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> fn)</span>, with no hints: this 
 supports your attempt to make adjustments so that guard verification will 
 succed for your <span class="v">simplify</span> command.  It might be helpful to try one or more 
 of the following approaches.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Prove suitable rules, as noted above, towards removing the checkpoints. 
 You may wish to specify <span class="v">:guard-hints nil</span> in your new call of 
 <span class="v">simplify</span>, to match the call <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> fn)</span> that generated the 
 checkpoints that you considered.</li> 
 
 <li>Provide a <span class="v">:guard-hints</span> option, <span class="v">(<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">simplify</a> FN :guard-hints ...)</span> 
 that specifies a suitable theory and, perhaps, include <span class="v">:use (:guard-theorem
 FN)</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>Delay guard verification with <span class="v">(<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">simplify</a> FN :verify-guards nil ...)</span>. 
 Then, after this <span class="v">simplify</span> completes successfully, call <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> on <span class="v">FN</span>, perhaps with suitable hints as suggested 
 above.</li> 
 
 <li>If you use <span class="v">:print info</span> or <span class="v">:print :all</span>, you may see a message 
 like the following. 
 <pre class="code">Saving proof-builder error state; see :DOC instructions.  To retrieve:
(<a href="ACL2____RETRIEVE.html">RETRIEVE</a> :ERROR1)</pre> 
 If you invoke that command in the ACL2 loop, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETRIEVE.html">RETRIEVE</a> :ERROR1)</span>, 
 then you will be in the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">ACL2::proof-builder</a>.  You can run the 
 <span class="v">prove</span> command there and look at the checkpoints.  Consider the following 
 (admittedly artificial) example. 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> my-consp (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> my-cdr (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (my-consp x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f1 (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (my-consp (f1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) (f1 (my-cdr x)))
        x)
    x))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> f1-id (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f1 x) x))
(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> f1)
(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> my-consp my-cdr (<a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>)))
(<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">simplify</a> f1 :print :info)</pre> 
 If you run <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETRIEVE.html">RETRIEVE</a> :ERROR1)</span> and then submit <span class="v">PROVE</span>, you'll see the 
 following checkpoint. 
 <pre class="code">Goal'
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X) (MY-CONSP (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">CDR</a> X)))
         (MY-CONSP X))</pre> 
 This checkpoint rather clearly suggests enabling <span class="v">my-consp</span>.  Indeed, you 
 can do that in the proof-builder: the command <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">IN-THEORY</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">ENABLE</a>
 MY-CONSP))</span> followed by <span class="v">PROVE</span> completes the proof in the proof-builder. 
 With that information you can exit the proof-builder and successfully run the 
 following command in the ACL2 loop. 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">simplify</a> f1 :guard-hints (("Goal" :in-theory (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> my-consp))))</pre> 
 </li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h3>Applicability condition failure</h3> 
 
 <p>If the failure is in the <span class="v">:assumptions-preserved</span> applicability 
 condition, consider supplying <span class="v">:hints</span>, first proving useful rules, or 
 both.</p> 
 
 <h3>Preserving special behavior such as side-effects</h3> 
 
 <p>Maybe your call of <span class="v">simplify</span> succeeded, but the result failed to 
 preserve a desired call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span>, or 
 another such operator that provides special behavior.  See <a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST-BLOCKERS.html">ACL2::return-last-blockers</a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Recursion and equivalence relations</h3> 
 
 <p>As of this writing, the <span class="v">simplify</span> transformation does not fully support 
 the use of the <span class="v">:equiv</span> option for recursive definitions, though it might 
 succeed on occasion.  Consider the following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> x 3))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (g (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 3 x)))
    (f x)))

(<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">simplify</a> g :equiv iff)</pre> 
 
 <p>The result is an error with the following message.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Error in (<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">APT::SIMPLIFY</a> G ...):  An attempt to simplify the definition
of G has failed, probably because the definition of the new function,
G$1, is recursive and the equivalence relation specified by :EQUIV
is IFF, not EQUAL.  See :DOC apt::simplify-failure.</pre> 
 
 <p>By adding the option <span class="v">:show-only t</span>, we can see the generated 
 definition:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">DEFUN</a> G$1 (X)
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">DECLARE</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">XARGS</a> :GUARD T
                       :MEASURE (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-COUNT</a> X)
                       :VERIFY-GUARDS NIL))
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">IF</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (G$1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">CDR</a> X)) 3)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> X 3)))</pre> 
 
 <p>In this example, the original and proposed simplified definitions are 
 actually <i>not</i> Boolean equivalent.  But in some cases, they might be 
 equivalent but ACL2 fails to prove this.</p> 
 
 <p>A solution for these other cases, where equivalence holds but was not 
 successfully proved, might be first to prove suitable congruence rules, so 
 that at each recursive call in the simplified definition (usually the new 
 definition, as in the error above), it suffices to preserve the specified 
 congruence relation.  This may eventually be worked into a new applicability 
 condition.  (A comment about this may be found in the source code for 
 this :doc topic.)</p> 
 
 <h3>General approaches to unsuccessful invocations of <span class="v">simplify</span>
</h3> 
 
 <p>Here are several ways to get more information about what is happening.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Use <span class="v">:print :info</span> to get a running commentary and perhaps a more 
 detailed error.</li> 
 
 <li>Use <span class="v">:print :all</span> to get even more output.  This maximal level of 
 output may be distracting, but near the end of it you might find useful 
 simplification checkpoints, for example from a failed attempt to prove the 
 measure conjecture.  Those checkpoints may serve, as is common when using 
 ACL2, to help you to discover additional theorems to prove first, in 
 particular, to be stored as rewrite rules.</li> 
 
 <li>Use <span class="v">show-simplify</span> with the same arguments as you used for 
 <span class="v">simplify</span>, to get the event form that is actually submitted by your call 
 of <span class="v">simplify</span>.  Then use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REDO-FLAT.html">redo-flat</a></span> to get to the failed 
 event, perhaps using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PBT.html">pbt</a></span> to see which event failed by seeing 
 which events from <span class="v">show-simplify</span> are now in the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  Then p 
 submit that failed event and see if the output helps you to fix your 
 <span class="v">simplify</span> call.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>(If you have any suggestions for other steps to take upon failure, by all 
 means add them here or ask someone to do so!)</p>
