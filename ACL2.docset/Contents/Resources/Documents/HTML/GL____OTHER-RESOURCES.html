<p>Additional resources (talks, academic papers, a dissertation) for 
learning about GL.</p><p>Besides this <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> documentation, most GL users will 
probably want to be aware of at least the following resources:</p>

<dt>Sol Swords and Jared Davis.  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.70.7" target="_blank"><nobr>Bit-Blasting ACL2 Theorems<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.70.7"></nobr></a>. 
In ACL2 Workshop 2011.  November, 2011.  EPTCS 70.  Pages 84-102.</dt> 
 
<dd>This is an approachable, user-focused introduction to GL as of 2011, which 
also contains many pointers to related work.  It's probably a good idea to read 
this first, noting that a few details have changed.  Much of this paper has now 
been incorporated into this <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> documentation.</dd> 
 
<dt>Sol Swords.  <a href="http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2010-12-2210" target="_blank"><nobr>A 
Verified Framework for Symbolic Execution in the ACL2 Theorem Prover<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2010-12-2210"></nobr></a>. 
Ph.D. thesis, University of Texas at Austin.  December, 2010.</dt> 
 
<dd>This is the most comprehensive guide to GL's internals.  It covers tricky 
topics like the handling of <i>if</i> statements and the details of BDD 
parametrization.  It also covers the logical foundations of GL, such as 
correctness claims for symbolic counterparts, the introduction of symbolic 
interpreters, and the definition and verification of the GL clause processor. 
Some topics are now somewhat dated, but it is good general background for 
anyone who wants to extend GL.</dd> 
 
<dt>The documentation for <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>.</dt> 
 
<dd>GL makes heavy use of hash consing and memoization.  GL users will likely 
want to be aware of the basics of <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>, and of commands 
like <a href="ACL2____HONS-SUMMARY.html">hons-summary</a>, <a href="ACL2____HONS-WASH.html">hons-wash</a>, and <a href="ACL2____SET-MAX-MEM.html">set-max-mem</a>.</dd>

<dd>This is a more recent paper that's not especially focused on GL, but which 
covers <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> and <a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a>, which can be used by 
GL in its new <a href="GL____GL-SATLINK-MODE.html">gl-satlink-mode</a>.  Many problems that are difficult to 
solve using <a href="ACL2____UBDDS.html">ubdds</a> can be solved using <a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a>.</dd>

<h4>GL Applications</h4> 
 
<p>GL has been used at Centaur Technology to verify RTL implementations of 
floating-point addition, multiplication, and conversion operations, as well as 
hundreds of bitwise and arithmetic operations on scalar and packed integers. 
Some papers describing some of this work include:</p>

Verification Framework for Industrial Scale Validation<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/MEMCOD.2011.5970515"></nobr></a>.  In Memocode 2011, 
IEEE.  Pages 89-97.</li>

of Formal Verification at Centaur Technology</i>.  In David Hardin, editor, <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1841184" target="_blank"><nobr>Design and Verification of 
Microprocessor Systems for High-Assurance Applications<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1841184"></nobr></a>, Pages 65-88.

<h4>History</h4> 
 
<p>GL is the successor of Boyer and Hunt's <b>G</b> system, the best 
description of which may be found in:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Robert S. Boyer and Warren A. Hunt, Jr.  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1637837.1637840" target="_blank"><nobr>Symbolic Simulation in 
ACL2<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1637837.1637840"></nobr></a>.  In ACL2 Workshop 2009, ACM, 2009.  Pages 20-24.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The name, GL, its name stands for <i>G in the Logic</i>.  The G system was 
written as a raw Lisp extension of the ACL2 kernel, so using it meant trusting 
this additional code.  In contrast, GL is implemented as ACL2 books and its 
proof procedure is formally verified by ACL2, so the only code we have to trust 
is in ACL2, including its <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a> features.</p>
