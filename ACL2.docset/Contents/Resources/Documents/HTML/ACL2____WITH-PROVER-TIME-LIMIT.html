<p>Limit the time for proofs</p><pre class="code">Examples:

; Limit (mini-proveall) to about 1/4 second:
(<a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a> 1/4 (mini-proveall))

; Limit (mini-proveall) to about 1/4 second, even if surrounding call of
; with-prover-time-limit provides for a more restrictive bound:
(<a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a> '(1/4) (mini-proveall))

; Limit the indicated theorem to about 1/50 second, and if the proof does not
; complete or it fails, then put down a label instead.

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a> time form)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">time</span> evaluates to a positive rational number or to a list 
 containing such, and <span class="v">form</span> is arbitrary.  Logically, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a> time form)</span> is equivalent to <span class="v">form</span>.  However, 
 if the time for evaluation of <span class="v">form</span> exceeds the value specified by 
 <span class="v">time</span>, and if ACL2 notices this fact during a proof, then that proof will 
 abort, for example like this:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Error in ( DEFTHM PERM-REFLEXIVE ...):  Out of time in the rewriter.</pre> 
 
 <p>If there is already a surrounding call of <span class="v">with-prover-time-limit</span> that 
 has set up an expiration time, the inner <span class="v">with-prover-time-limit</span> call is 
 not allowed to push that time further into the future unless the inner time is 
 specified as a list containing a rational, rather than as a rational.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that by default, the time used is runtime (cpu time); to switch to 
 realtime (elapsed time), see <a href="ACL2____GET-INTERNAL-TIME.html">get-internal-time</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For a related utility based on prover steps instead of time, see <a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">with-prover-step-limit</a>; also see <a href="ACL2____SET-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">set-prover-step-limit</a>.  Those 
 utilities have the advantage of having platform-independent behavior, unlike 
 time limits, which of course are generally less restrictive for faster 
 processors.  But note that the prover steps counted need not correspond 
 closely to prover time.  For other utilities that limit time, see <a href="ACL2____WITH-TIMEOUT.html">with-timeout</a> and <a href="ACL2____ORACLE-TIMELIMIT.html">oracle-timelimit</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Although <span class="v">with-prover-time-limit</span> behaves like an ACL2 function in the 
 sense that it evaluates both its arguments, it is however actually a macro 
 that behaves as follows.  (1) The value of its first (time limit) argument 
 affects the evaluation of its second argument (by causing an error during that 
 evaluation if the time for completion is insufficient).  (2) The second 
 argument can return multiple values (see <a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a>), which are then returned 
 by the call of <span class="v">with-prover-time-limit</span>.  (3) Thus, there is not a fixed 
 number of values returned by <span class="v">with-prover-time-limit</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If you find that the time limit appears to be implemented too loosely, it 
 may be because the prover only checks the time elapsed at certain points 
 during the proof process, for example at entry to the rewriter.  For example, 
 if you write your own <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a></span> that does an expensive 
 computation, the time is unlikely to be checked during its execution.  If 
 however you find the time limit seems to be ignored even during ordinary 
 prover operation, you are encouraged to email an example to the ACL2 
 implementors with instructions on how to observe the undesirable behavior. 
 This information can perhaps be used to improve ACL2 by the insertion of more 
 checks for expiration of the time limit.</p> 
 
 <p>The rest of this documentation topic explains the rather subtle logical 
 story, and is not necessary for understanding how to use 
 <span class="v">with-prover-time-limit</span>.  The ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> object logically contains 
 a field called the <span class="v">acl2-oracle</span>, which is an arbitrary true list of 
 objects; see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____READ-ACL2-ORACLE.html">read-ACL2-oracle</a></span>.  Our claim is that every ACL2 session 
 makes sense for <b>some</b> value of <span class="v">acl2-oracle</span> in the initial 
 <span class="v">state</span> for that session.  Logically, <span class="v">with-prover-time-limit</span> is a 
 no-op, just returning its second value.  But under the hood, it provides a 
 ``hint'' for the <span class="v">acl2-oracle</span>, so that (logically speaking) when its first 
 element (<span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>) is consulted by ACL2's prover to see if the time limit 
 has expired, it gets the ``right'' answer (specifically, either nil if all is 
 well or else a message to print if the time limit has expired).  Logically, 
 the <span class="v">acl2-oracle</span> is then <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span>'ed — that is, its first element 
 is popped off — so that future results from <span class="v">read-acl2-oracle</span> are 
 independent of the one just obtained.</p>
