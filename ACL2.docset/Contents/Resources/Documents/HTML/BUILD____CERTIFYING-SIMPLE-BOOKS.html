<p>How to use certify simple ACL2 books, take advantage of parallel 
builds, and manage the dependency scanner.</p><h3>Basic Example</h3> 
 
<p>Let's use <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to build a simple ACL2 project.  Say we have two ACL2 
books:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">;; inc.lisp            |  ;; prop.lisp
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")    |  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> inc (x)         |  (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "inc")
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 x))             |
                       |  (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> natp-of-inc
                       |    (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> x)
                       |             (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> (inc x)))</pre> 
 
<p>We can now certify either book by just running <span class="v">cert.pl</span> on it.  Let's 
first just build the <span class="v">inc</span> book:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl inc
ACL2 executable is /home/jared/bin/acl2
System books directory is /home/jared/acl2/books/
Making /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/inc.cert on 25-Oct-2013 21:49:11
Successfully built /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/inc.cert
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jared logic 378 Oct 25 21:49 inc.cert</pre> 
 
<p>If we run <span class="v">ls</span>, we'll now see some new files:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">inc.cert</span>, the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">ACL2::certificate</a> for <span class="v">inc.lisp</span>
</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">inc.cert.out</span>, the log for certifying <span class="v">inc</span>; this shows the 
instructions that were submitted to ACL2, and the output from the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> command.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">inc.lx64fsl</span> or <span class="v">.fasl</span> or perhaps some other extension, depending 
on the underlying host Lisp.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">Makefile-tmp</span>, a Makefile that <span class="v">cert.pl</span> generated.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>We might now run <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to certify the <span class="v">prop</span> book.  Since <span class="v">inc</span> 
is already certified, it only needs to build <span class="v">prop</span>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl prop
ACL2 executable is /home/jared/bin/acl2
System books directory is /home/jared/acl2/books/
Making /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/prop.cert on 26-Oct-2013 07:55:16
Successfully built /home/jared/acl2/books/tmp/prop.cert
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jared logic 465 Oct 26 07:55 prop.cert</pre> 
 
<p>An <span class="v">ls</span> will now show us many files:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ ls
inc.cert      inc.lisp     Makefile-tmp  prop.cert.out  prop.lx64fsl
inc.cert.out  inc.lx64fsl  prop.cert     prop.lisp</pre> 
 
<p>We can delete the generated files with <b>clean.pl</b>, a companion script 
of <span class="v">cert.pl</span>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ clean.pl
clean.pl: scanning for generated files
clean.pl: found 7 targets (0 seconds)
clean.pl: deleted 7 files (0 seconds)
$ ls
inc.lisp  prop.lisp</pre> 
 
<p>If we now tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to certify the <span class="v">prop</span> book directly, it will 
notice that the <span class="v">inc</span> book needs to be certified, and do the right thing:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl prop
ACL2 executable is /home/jared/bin/acl2
System books directory is /home/jared/acl2/books/

<h3>Useful Features</h3> 
 
 
<h5>Multiple Targets</h5> 
 
<p>You can tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to build multiple top-level books at once, for 
instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl foo bar baz</pre> 
 
<p>will try to certify <span class="v">foo.lisp</span>, <span class="v">bar.lisp</span>, and <span class="v">baz.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h5>File Name Extensions</h5> 
 
<p>You don't have to include a <span class="v">.lisp</span> or <span class="v">.cert</span> extension, but if you 
do, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will do what you mean.  For instance, the following commands 
are all equivalent:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl foo
$ cert.pl foo.lisp
$ cert.pl foo.cert</pre> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">.lisp</span> form can be handy, e.g., you can do:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl *.lisp</pre> 
 
 
<h5>Parallel Builds (-j)</h5> 
 
<p>You can tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to build books in parallel, to take advantage of 
multi-core processors.  The <span class="v">-j</span> switch tells it how many processors you 
want to use, just like with <span class="v">make</span>.  Typically you would want to set <span class="v">-j</span> 
no higher than the number of cores your machine has available.  For 
instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl -j 2 foo    # for a dual-core system
$ cert.pl -j 4 foo    # for a 4-core system
$ cert.pl -j 8 foo    # for an 8-core system</pre> 
 
<p><b>Warning</b>: setting <span class="v">-j</span> too high can cause serious performance 
problems.  If you often use ACL2 on both, say, a 16-core server and a 2-core 
laptop, then you may sometimes find yourself accidentally telling the laptop to 
run 16 jobs at once!  To avoid this kind of trouble, Jared sets up an 
<span class="v">alias</span> like this in his <span class="v">.bashrc</span>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code"># in the laptop's .bashrc:
alias cj="cert.pl -j 2"

# in the server's .bashrc:
alias cj="cert.pl -j 16"</pre> 
 
<p>This way, just running <span class="v">cj</span> will use an appropriate number of cores no 
matter which system is being used.</p> 
 
<p><b>Warning</b>: the CPU count is not the only factor to consider when 
choosing a <span class="v">-j</span> to use.  You may also need to consider how much memory your 
machine has.  For instance, on a quad-core laptop you'd like to run 4 jobs at 
once, but if you only have 8 GB of memory and each job takes 4 GB, then using 
<span class="v">-j 4</span> may get you into swapping trouble.</p> 
 
 
<h5>Keep Going (-k)</h5> 
 
<p>Like <span class="v">make</span>, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will ordinarily stop as soon as it fails to 
build any book.</p> 
 
<p>Occasionally this may not be what you want.  You might have made a change 
that you know will break several books.  One way to find out what's broken is 
to just try to build everything.  The default behavior—stopping as soon 
as anything is broken—will only let you find one broken book at a 
time.</p> 
 
<p>In this situation, you may want to instead do, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl -j 4 top.cert -k</pre> 
 
<p>This is identical to <span class="v">make</span>'s "keep going" switch.</p> 
 
 
<h5>Prepare (-p)</h5> 
 
<p>Sometimes you want to work on a particular book, which you know won't 
certify (e.g., because you're only part-way through a proof).  Before you begin 
working on the book again, you may want to rebuild any supporting books it 
depends on.  The <span class="v">-p</span> flag lets you do this, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl -p mybook</pre> 
 
<p>won't try to certify <span class="v">mybook.lisp</span>, but it will try to certify any books 
that <span class="v">mybook.lisp</span> includes.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Dependency Scanning Limitations</h3> 
 
<p>Keep in mind that <span class="v">cert.pl</span> is a dumb Perl script.  It's quite easy to 
fool it using <a href="ACL2____MACROS.html">ACL2::macros</a> or other tricks.  But you don't even need to 
get that fancy—a newline will do the trick.  For instance, if 
<span class="v">foo.lisp</span> contains the following, then <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will not think it 
depends on <span class="v">bar</span>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>     ;; newline to fool dependency scanner
  "bar")</pre> 
 
<p>This is documented behavior that you may rely on.</p> 
 
<p>For instance, sometimes we put multi-line comments in books with performance 
comparisons or other kinds of examples or testing code.  This code might need 
additional include-books to work.  By putting in newlines, we can hide these 
books from the dependency scanner, to avoid slowing down our build with 
unnecessary dependencies.  For instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> my-function ...)

#|| ;; this benchmark says my-function is 3x faster than yours:

(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>           ;; fool dependency scanner
   "your-function")

:q
(time (loop for i fixnum from 1 to 100000 do (my-function ...)))
(time (loop for i fixnum from 1 to 100000 do (your-function ...)))
||#

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> my-lemma ...)</pre> 
 
<p>You can also trick <span class="v">cert.pl</span> in the other direction, to add additional, 
unnecessary dependencies.  For instance, a macro library might have some unit 
testing books to try to ensure the macros are behaving correctly.  To ensure 
these tests get run when the library is rebuilt, we might write a top book like 
this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "module1")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "module2")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "module3")

#|| ;; trick cert.pl into running the unit tests:
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "module1-tests")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "module2-tests")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "module3-tests")
||#</pre>
