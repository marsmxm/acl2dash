<p>Wallet structure.</p><p>[BIP32] describes a recommended structure for the key tree. 
     This is illustrated in a figure in [BIP32], 
     an explained in Section `Specification: Wallet structure' of [BIP32].</p><p>According to the figure, each key in the tree has depth 0, 1, 2, or 3. 
     The master key is at depth 0, as always. 
     The keys at depth 1 are account keys, one per account. 
     The keys at depth 2 are chain keys, one per chain. 
     The keys at depth 3 are account keys, one per account.</p><p>We formalize this structure as a predicate over key trees. 
     With that in hand, we can formally say whether 
     (the key tree of) a wallet is compliant with this structure or not. 
     This compliance predicate is defined incrementally below.</p>
