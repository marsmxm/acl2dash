<p>List of other definition rules for the proofs generated by ATC.</p><p>These are designated as `other' with respect to the definition rules 
     for shifts and other operations that are collected separately.</p><p>During symbolic execution, terms appear 
     with certain non-recursive functions applied to 
     terms that are not constant, but contain constant parts. 
     These can be simplified by opening the function definition, 
     which ACL2's heuristics (we believe) should never block, 
     given that they are not recursive. 
     Some are <span class="v">exec-...</span> functions, 
     others are functions to manipulate the frame stack, 
     etc.</p><p>We expand <span class="tt"><a href="C____CONDEXPR.html">condexpr</a></span> because it is just a wrapper 
     that signifies a conditional expression instead of statement.</p><p>It may seem surprising that 
     we expand functions like <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-DEC-CONST.html">sint-dec-const</a></span>, 
     since those correspond to C constructs; 
     we certainly do not expand functions like <span class="tt"><a href="C____ADD-SINT-SINT.html">add-sint-sint</a></span>. 
     The reason is that functions like <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-DEC-CONST.html">sint-dec-const</a></span> 
     are used to represent C constants in ACL2 functions, 
     but in the dynamic semantics, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="C____EXEC-ICONST.html">exec-iconst</a></span> (which we expand, obviously) 
     produces terms of the form <span class="v">(<a href="C____SINT.html">sint</a> &lt;quoted-integer&gt;)</span>. 
     By expanding <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-DEC-CONST.html">sint-dec-const</a></span> in the ACL2 functions, 
     we produce terms of the form <span class="v">(<a href="C____SINT.html">sint</a> &lt;quoted-integer&gt;)</span>, 
     which therefore match the ones from <span class="tt"><a href="C____EXEC-ICONST.html">exec-iconst</a></span>.</p><p>We do not expand any fixtype constructors. 
     This is because such expansions would expose 
     the internal representational details of the fixtype's values. 
     Instead, we want to operate on those as more abstract entities, 
     and use deconstructors to obtain their components. 
     In fact, as explained elsewhere, 
     we enable rules that simplify 
     applications of deconstructors to constructors.</p><p>We expand <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-FROM-BOOLEAN.html">sint-from-boolean</a></span>, 
     because it is really just an abbreviation. 
     In fact, we want to expose its <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> structure 
     in the symbolic execution.</p><p><b>Definition: </b>*atc-other-definition-rules*</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> *atc-other-definition-rules*
