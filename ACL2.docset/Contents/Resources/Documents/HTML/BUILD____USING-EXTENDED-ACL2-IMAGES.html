<p>(Advanced) how to get <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">cert.pl</a> to use <a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> images 
to certify parts of your project.</p><p>In most ACL2 projects, each book uses <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> to load 
all of its dependencies, and the same, "stock" ACL2 executable is used to 
certify every book.  This generally works well and certainly keeps things 
simple.</p> 
 
<p>By default, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will simply try to certify all books using whatever 
ACL2 image is invoked with <span class="v">acl2</span>, or else whatever image it is told to use 
via the <span class="v">$ACL2</span> environment variable or the <span class="v">--acl2</span> option; see 
<i>Helping <span class="v">cert.pl</span> find ACL2</i> of <a href="BUILD____PRELIMINARIES.html">preliminaries</a> for 
details.</p> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, this usual approach means that widely included books must be 
loaded repeatedly.  As your project grows, you may eventually find that you are 
spending a lot of time waiting for <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> commands.  One way to 
combat this is to use <a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> to write out a new ACL2 image that has 
your supporting books pre-loaded.  These extended ACL2 images can be re-started 
instantly.  For interactive development, images can be a very convenient way to 
quickly get back into a good starting place, with your supporting books already 
loaded.  Meanwhile, using images to re-certify books can significantly reduce 
the time spent waiting for <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> commands to finish.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">cert.pl</span> supports using extended images for certain books.  For this to 
work, you will need to get a few pieces working together.  The notes below 
explain the basics of how to set this up.  See also 
<span class="v">projects/milawa/ACL2/Makefile</span> for a working example of a project that uses 
around a dozen images to certify various directories of files.</p> 
 
<h3>Image Creation</h3> 
 
<p>Suppose you want to use <a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> to create an extended ACL2 image 
using the following script:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">;; make-extended-acl2.lsp
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "support")
:q
(<a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> "extended-acl2" "Supporting libraries pre-loaded.")</pre> 
 
<p>While <span class="v">cert.pl</span> does have good support for using the resulting image to 
certify particular books, there is currently no way to directly tell 
<span class="v">cert.pl</span> that it needs to run this script to create the <span class="v">extended-acl2</span> 
image.  Instead, if you want to use extended ACL2 images, you will probably 
need to put together a <span class="v">Makefile</span>.  See <a href="BUILD____STATIC-MAKEFILES.html">static-makefiles</a> for 
information about how to use <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to do the dependency scanning for 
your <span class="v">Makefile</span>.</p> 
 
<p>In your <span class="v">Makefile</span>, you can easily explain what the dependencies of 
<span class="v">extended-acl2</span> are, and how to build it, e.g., as follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">extended-acl2: support.cert make-extended-acl2.lsp
    @rm -f extended-acl2
    $(ACL2) &lt; make-extended-acl2.lsp &amp;&gt; extended-acl2.out
    ls -l extended-acl2</pre> 
 
 
<h3>Helping <span class="v">cert.pl</span> find your Images</h3> 
 
<p>For <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to find <span class="v">extended-acl2</span>, the easiest thing to do is make 
sure that it is located somewhere in your <span class="v">$PATH</span>, and we especially 
recommend this option if you are going to be invoking <span class="v">cert.pl</span> 
interactively, i.e., not exclusively from your <span class="v">Makefile</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Alternately, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> accepts a <span class="v">--bin</span> option that can be used to 
indicate which directory will contain images.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Specifying the Image for each Book</h3> 
 
<p>To decide what image to use to certify <span class="v">foo.lisp</span>, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will 
first look for a file named <span class="v">foo.image</span>.  This file should contain a single 
line that just gives the name of the ACL2 image to use.  For instance, if we 
want to certify <span class="v">foo.lisp</span> using <span class="v">extended-acl2</span>, then <span class="v">foo.image</span> 
should simply contain:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">extended-acl2</pre> 
 
<p>You can also write a <span class="v">cert.image</span> file to indicate a directory-wide 
default image to use.  (This is exactly analogous to how <span class="v">cert.pl</span> looks for 
<span class="v">.acl2</span> files for <a href="BUILD____PRE-CERTIFY-BOOK-COMMANDS.html">pre-certify-book-commands</a>.)</p>
