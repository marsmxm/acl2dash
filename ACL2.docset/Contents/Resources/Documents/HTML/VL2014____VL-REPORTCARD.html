<p>A (typically fast) alist associating names to warnings.</p><p>A <i>report card</i> associates <a href="VL2014____VL-REPORTCARDKEY-P.html">vl-reportcardkey-p</a>s to lists 
of warnings.  Typically the keys are the names of top-level design 
elements (modules, packages, interfaces, ...).  However, as a special case for 
warnings about top-level design elements that aren't in any container, e.g., 
top-level parameters or functions, we also allow <span class="v">:design</span> as a key.</p> 
 
<p>There are two common uses for report cards.</p> 
 
<ol> 
 
<li>When transforming modules, we sometimes want to add a warning to some other 
module that is "far away," i.e., not the module we're currently rewriting. 
It would be somewhat awkward to iteratively update the <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULELIST-P.html">vl-modulelist-p</a>, 
so instead we might create a report card that associates target module names 
with the new warnings we want to add to them.  The function <a href="VL2014____VL-APPLY-REPORTCARD.html">vl-apply-reportcard</a> can then be used to add these warnings to a design.</li> 
 
<li>Report cards can be useful when we want to print the warnings for a bunch 
of modules.  Depending on the context, we might want to associate either the 
elaborated (unparameterized) names of modules, or their original names, to 
their related warnings.</li>
