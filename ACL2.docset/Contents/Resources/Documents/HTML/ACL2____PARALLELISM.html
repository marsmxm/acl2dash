<p>Experimental extension for parallel execution and proofs</p><p>This documentation topic relates to an experimental extension of 
 ACL2, ACL2(p), created initially by David L. Rager.  See <a href="ACL2____COMPILING-ACL2P.html">compiling-ACL2p</a> for how to build an executable image that supports parallel 
 execution.  Also see community books directory <span class="v">books/parallel/</span> for 
 examples.  For a completely different sort of parallelism, at the system 
 level, see <a href="ACL2____PROVISIONAL-CERTIFICATION.html">provisional-certification</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>IMPORTANT NOTE.  We hope and expect that every evaluation result is 
 correctly computed by ACL2(p), and that every formula proved using ACL2(p) is 
 a theorem of the ACL2 logic (and in fact is provable using ACL2).  However, we 
 do not guarantee these properties.  Since ACL2(p) is intended to be an aid in 
 efficient evaluation and proof development, we focus less on ironclad 
 soundness and more on providing an efficient and working implementation. 
 Nevertheless, if you encounter a case where ACL2(p) computes an incorrect 
 result, or produces a proof where ACL2 fails to do so (and this failure is not 
 discussed in <a href="ACL2____UNSUPPORTED-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM-FEATURES.html">unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features</a>), please notify 
 the implementors.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 source code provides experimental parallel execution and proof 
 capabilities.  For example, one of ACL2's strengths lies in its ability to 
 simulate industrial models efficiently, and it can also decrease the time 
 required for proofs about such models both by making use of parallel 
 evaluation and by dispatching proof subgoals in parallel.</p> 
 
 <p>While we aim to support Clozure Common Lisp (CCL), Steel Bank Common Lisp 
 (SBCL), and Lispworks, SBCL and Lispworks both currently sometimes experience 
 problems when evaluating the ACL2 proof process (the ``waterfall'') in 
 parallel.  Therefore, CCL is the recommend Lisp for anyone that wants to use 
 parallelism and isn't working on fixing those problems.</p>
