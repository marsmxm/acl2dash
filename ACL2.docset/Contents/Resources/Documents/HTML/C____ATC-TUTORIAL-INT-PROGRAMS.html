<p>ATC tutorial: ACL2 representation and generation of C <span class="v">int</span> programs.</p><p>After describing 
    our ACL2 representation of the C <span class="v">int</span> type and operations 
    in <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-INT-REPRESENTATION.html">atc-tutorial-int-representation</a>, 
    now we describe how that is used to represent and generate 
    C <span class="v">int</span> programs, i.e. programs that manipulate <span class="v">int</span> values.</p><p>We do that via a simple example, 
    but present concepts that apply more generally. 
    However, this page only describes the basics of 
    representing and generating C <span class="v">int</span> programs: 
    more advanced features are presented in subsequent tutorial pages.</p><h5>Simple Example</h5><p>Our simple example is a C program consisting of a single function:</p><pre class="code">int f(int x, int y, int z) {
    return (x + y) * (z - 3);
}</pre><p>This function takes three <span class="v">int</span> values 
    and returns an <span class="v">int</span> value resulting from 
    their combination via <span class="v">int</span> operations. 
    The function also involves the use of an <span class="v">int</span> constant.</p><h5>Function Correspondence</h5><p>There is a one-to-one representational correspondence 
    between C and ACL2 functions. 
    That is, every C function is represented by an ACL2 function, 
    whose name must be supplied to ATC in order to generate 
    the corresponding C function definition 
    (the exact call of ATC is described later in this page).</p><p>Thus, for the example program above, 
    we need an ACL2 function to represent <span class="v">f</span>. 
    This generalizes to C programs with multiple functions.</p><h5>Function and Parameter Names</h5><p>The names of the function and its parameters 
    are represented by ACL2 symbols 
    whose names are identical to the C identifiers:</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> |f| (|x| |y| |z|)
  ...)</pre><p>Note that we need the double bar notation because 
    the names are lowercase, consistently with the C convention. 
    If we omitted the double bars, 
    we would be representing a different C function:</p><pre class="code">int F(int X, int Y, int Z) {
    ...
}</pre><p>This is because, without the vertical bars, 
    the names of the symbols are uppercase. 
    This is a valid C function, 
    but does not follow the normal C naming conventions.</p><p>Package names are ignored for this purpose, 
    e.g. both <span class="v">acl2::|f|</span> and <span class="v">c::|f|</span> represent 
    the C identifier <span class="v">f</span>.</p><p>In the envisioned use of ATC, 
    the user would write ACL2 functions with more conventional ACL2 names 
    for both functions and parameters 
    (i.e. without vertical bars). 
    The user would then use APT transformations to turn those names 
    into the form required to represent C names for ATC's purposes.</p><p>More details about the mapping from ACL2 names to C names 
    are given in <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-IDENTIFIERS.html">atc-tutorial-identifiers</a>.</p><h5>Function Body</h5><p>Given the representation of C <span class="v">int</span> operations (including constants) 
    described in <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-INT-REPRESENTATION.html">atc-tutorial-int-representation</a>, 
    it should be easy to see how the body of the C function <span class="v">f</span> above 
    is represented as follows in ACL2:</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> |f| (|x| |y| |z|)
  (<a href="C____MUL-SINT-SINT.html">c::mul-sint-sint</a> (<a href="C____ADD-SINT-SINT.html">c::add-sint-sint</a> |x| |y|)
                    (<a href="C____SUB-SINT-SINT.html">c::sub-sint-sint</a> |z| (<a href="C____SINT-DEC-CONST.html">c::sint-dec-const</a> 3))))</pre><p>We represent the expression of the <span class="v">return</span> statement 
    that forms the body of the function <span class="v">f</span>. 
    In ACL2, terms are implicitly returned, 
    so there is no need to represent the <span class="v">return</span> statement explicitly.</p><p>The <span class="v">c::</span> package prefixes are generally needed 
    when the function is defined in a different ACL2 package from <span class="v">"C"</span>. 
    The package of the symbols <span class="v">|f|</span>, <span class="v">|x|</span>, etc. do not matter, 
    in the sense that they do not represent anything in the C code. 
    However the functions <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-DEC-CONST.html">sint-dec-const</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="C____ADD-SINT-SINT.html">add-sint-sint</a></span>, etc. 
    must be the ones in the <span class="v">"C"</span> package, 
    from the file <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/c/atc/integers.lisp</span>.</p><p>In the envisioned use of ATC, 
    the user would not write directly a function body of the form above. 
    Instead, they would obtain that kind of function body 
    via suitable APT transformations that turn 
    (conventional) ACL2 types and operations 
    into (ACL2 representations of) C types and operations, 
    under suitable preconditions.</p><h5>Function Input and Ouput Types</h5><p>Given the use of <span class="tt"><a href="C____ADD-SINT-SINT.html">add-sint-sint</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="C____SUB-SINT-SINT.html">sub-sint-sint</a></span> 
    on the ACL2 parameters <span class="v">|x|</span>, <span class="v">|y|</span>, and <span class="v">|z|</span>, 
    it would not be hard to infer automatically that 
    these represent <span class="v">int</span> parameters in C. 
    However, the required guard verification described below 
    implicitly requires the guard of <span class="v">|f|</span> to express or imply 
    that <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINTP.html">sintp</a></span> holds on the function parameters. 
    For clarity, we require those to be expressed, not merely implied.</p><p>That is, the guard must include explicit conjuncts 
    that spell out the C types of the function's parameters. 
    For the example function, these are as follows:</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> |f| (|x| |y| |z|)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="C____SINTP.html">c::sintp</a> |x|)
                              (<a href="C____SINTP.html">c::sintp</a> |y|)
                              (<a href="C____SINTP.html">c::sintp</a> |z|)
                              ...))) ; more conjuncts, described below
  (<a href="C____MUL-SINT-SINT.html">c::mul-sint-sint</a> (<a href="C____ADD-SINT-SINT.html">c::add-sint-sint</a> |x| |y|)
                    (<a href="C____SUB-SINT-SINT.html">c::sub-sint-sint</a> |z| (<a href="C____SINT-DEC-CONST.html">c::sint-dec-const</a> 3))))</pre><p>When generating C code for <span class="v">|f|</span>, 
    ATC looks for those conjuncts in the guard. 
    These may occur anywhere in the guard, 
    not necessarily in order, 
    but they must be easily extractable 
    by looking at the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a></span> tree structure of the guard: 
    the conjuncts of interest must be leaves in that tree, 
    one for each function parameter. 
    For instance, the following would be equally acceptable:</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> |f| (|x| |y| |z|)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="C____SINTP.html">c::sintp</a> |z|)
                                   (<a href="C____SINTP.html">c::sintp</a> |x|))
                              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> ...
                                   (<a href="C____SINTP.html">c::sintp</a> |y|))
                              ...)))
  ...) ; body as above</pre><p>ATC infers the output type of a function 
    by performing a C type analysis of the function's body. 
    For the function <span class="v">|f|</span> above, 
    the output type is obviously <span class="v">int</span>, 
    because the body is a call of <span class="tt"><a href="C____MUL-SINT-SINT.html">mul-sint-sint</a></span>, 
    which is known to return (the ACL2 representation of) an <span class="v">int</span> value. 
    ATC does not require explicit return type theorems for the ACL2 functions 
    that are translated to C functions.</p><h5>Guard Verification</h5><p>ATC requires that the ACL2 functions that represent C functions 
    are guard-verified (which implies that they must be in logic mode). 
    This ensures that the ACL2 functions that represent C operations 
    are always applied to values whose result is well-defined 
    according to [C]. 
    It also ensures that <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-DEC-CONST.html">sint-dec-const</a></span> is always applied 
    to a natural number representable as an <span class="v">int</span>.</p><p>However, this generally requires guards to have additional conditions, 
    besides the <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINTP.html">sintp</a></span> conjunts discussed above. 
    It should be clear that a C function like <span class="v">f</span> 
    does not yield a well-defined [C] result 
    for every possible value of its arguments. 
    For instance, sufficiently large values of <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span> 
    would make the result of <span class="v">x + y</span> not representable as <span class="v">int</span>, 
    and thus not well-defined according to [C].</p><p>This should not be surprising. 
    It is fairly normal for programs to be correct 
    only under certain preconditions. 
    The example function <span class="v">f</span> above is a simple abstract example, 
    but in a practical development there must be natural preconditions 
    for the C functions that form the development; 
    otherwise, it would be impossible to formally prove correctness.</p><p>In a C program, there may be 
    functions that receive data from outside the program. 
    These functions should not assume any precondition on that data, 
    and diligently validate it before operating on it. 
    After validation, these C functions may call other C functions, 
    internal to the C program, in the sense that 
    they only receive data validated by the calling functions. 
    The validation provides preconditions 
    that may be assumed by the internal functions.</p><p>The example function <span class="v">f</span> may be regarded 
    as an internal function in the sense above. 
    For simplicity, we assume that every parameter of the function 
    is fairly small, more precisely not above 10 in absolute value. 
    The following is the function <span class="v">|f|</span> with the complete guard 
    and the hints and book inclusion and command to verify the guards:</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> ()

    obtained by unwrapping the C integers; 
    it uses <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span>, with non-linear arithmetic enabled. 
    There may be other ways to verify the guards of this function. 
    ATC does not require any specific approach: 
    it only requires that guards are verified in some way, 
    and that the types of the parameters 
    are explicitly expressed in the guard.</p><p>In the envisioned use of ATC, 
    the user may verify the guards of <span class="v">|f|</span> not directly, 
    but by using APT transformations that generate 
    a guard-verified <span class="v">|f|</span> of the form above. 
    The fact that the results of those operations 
    are representable in the range of <span class="v">int</span> given the preconditions, 
    could have been proved in earlier stages of the derivation, 
    directly on ACL2 integers. 
    Then suitable APT transformations may turn those 
    into <span class="v">int</span> values. 
    This use of APT in conjunction with ATC may be described 
    in upcoming tutorial pages.</p><h5>Code Generation</h5><p>Given the guard-verified ACL2 function <span class="v">|f|</span> above, 
    the C function <span class="v">f</span> can be generated as follows:</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "kestrel/c/atc/atc" :dir :system)
(<a href="C____ATC.html">c::atc</a> |f| :output-file "f.c")</pre><p>First, we must include ATC. 
    To avoid certain trust tag messages, 
    the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form could be augmented with a <span class="v">:ttags</span> option; 
    see the tests in <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/c/atc/tests</span> for examples.</p><p>The ATC tool is invoked on one or more ACL2 function symbols, 
    in this case just <span class="v">|f|</span>. 
    The <span class="v">:output-file</span> option says where the generated output file goes, 
    in this case <span class="v">f.c</span> in the current working directory. 
    This option is required: there is no default.</p><p>The above invocation of ATC generates the C file, 
    as conveyed by a message printed on the screen. 
    The invocation also prints certain event forms on the screen; 
    these will be described in <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-EVENTS.html">atc-tutorial-events</a> 
    and can be ignored for now.</p><p>Opening the file <span class="v">f.c</span> reveals exactly the function <span class="v">f</span> above. 
    ATC generates it from <span class="v">|f|</span>. 
    It also generates correctness theorems, 
    but those are examined elsewhere, as mentioned above.</p><p>This example can be found in <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/c/atc/tests/f.lisp</span>.</p><h5>Compilation and Execution</h5><p>On macOS or Linux, the generated file <span class="v">f.c</span> can be compiled via <span class="v">gcc</span>. 
    In fact, any C compiler, also on Windows, can compile the file. 
    However, a plain compilation command like <span class="v">gcc f.c</span> may fail 
    due to the absence of a <span class="v">main</span> function. 
    This is, of course, easy to add; 
    it should be added to a separate file, so that it does not get overwritten 
    if the above call of ATC is run again.</p><p>For instance, one may add a file <span class="v">f-test.c</span> with the following content:</p><pre class="code">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
    int x = 3;
    int y = -2;
    int z = 8;
    int r = f(x, y, z);
    printf("f(%d, %d, %d) = %d\n", x, y, z, r);
}</pre><p>This file calls the generated function on specific values, 
    and prints inputs and output. 
    The inclusion of <span class="v">stdio.h</span> is needed because of the use of <span class="v">printf</span>.</p><p>This file is found in <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/c/atc/tests/f-test.c</span>.</p><p>The two files may be compiled as follows on macOS or Linux:</p><pre class="code">gcc -o f f.c f-test.c</pre><p>The <span class="v">-o</span> option overrides the default name <span class="v">a.out</span> for the executable, 
    calling it <span class="v">f</span> instead. 
    The two file names are simply supplied to the compiler, 
    which will generate an executable containing 
    both the <span class="v">main</span> and the <span class="v">f</span> functions.</p><p>The executable may be run as follows:</p><pre class="code">./f</pre><p>This prints the following on the screen:</p><pre class="code">f(3, -2, 8) = 5</pre><div class="box"></div><p><b>Previous:</b> <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-INT-REPRESENTATION.html">ACL2 representation of the C <span class="v">int</span> type and operations</a></p><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-IDENTIFIERS.html">ACL2 representation of C identifiers</a></p>
