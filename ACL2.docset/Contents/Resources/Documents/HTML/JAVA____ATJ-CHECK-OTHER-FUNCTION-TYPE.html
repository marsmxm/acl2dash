<p>The primary and secondary input types attached to a function 
     are used to generate overloaded methods for the function. 
     It must be possible, at compile time, to always resolve the method, 
     based on the most specific argument types. 
     This should be guaranteed if the set of all the function's input types 
     (more precisely, the set of all the input type tuples of the function) 
     is closed under greatest lower bounds that do not include <span class="v">nil</span>s, 
     as explained below.</p><p>For example, consider a binary function <span class="v">f</span> 
     with two function types whose inputs are 
     <span class="v">(:arational :ainteger)</span> and <span class="v">(:ainteger :arational)</span>. 
     These will give rise to two overloaded methods for <span class="v">f</span>, 
     one with argument types <span class="v">Acl2Rational</span> and <span class="v">Acl2Integer</span>, 
     and one with argument types <span class="v">Acl2Integer</span> and <span class="v">Acl2Rational</span>. 
     Consider a method call whose actual argument types 
     are <span class="v">Acl2Integer</span> and <span class="v">Acl2Integer</span>: 
     if only those two overloaded methods are available, 
     then there is no most specific method that is based just on the types. 
     However, if a third overloaded method were available 
     with <span class="v">Acl2Integer</span> and <span class="v">Acl2Integer</span> as argument types, 
     that would be the most specific method to call. 
     This is the case if the table includes a function type for <span class="v">f</span> 
     with input types <span class="v">(:ainteger :ainteger)</span>.</p><p>Generalizing from this example, 
     we want the set of all function input types 
     to be closed under greatest lower bounds. 
     This way, if some tuple of actual arguments 
     fits two different overloaded methods, 
     it will also fit the method corresponding to the greatest lower bound; 
     therefore, there will be always a ``minimum'' method 
     that will be selected at compile time and called at run time. 
     However, recall that <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPE-MEET.html">atj-type-meet</a></span> may produce <span class="v">nil</span>: 
     if the greatest lower bound contains a <span class="v">nil</span> component, 
     the closure requirement does not apply, 
     because it means that some types are incompatible 
     and therefore there is no confusion about most specific types.</p><p>We calculate these greatest lower bounds on ATJ types, 
     not on the corresponding Java types, 
     even though it is the Java types that are used 
     to resolve the overloaded methods in the Java code. 
     This way, we have more flexibility in mapping 
     ATJ types that are related in the ATJ type partial order 
     to Java types that are not related in the Java type partial order.</p><p>The closure property is also needed for ATJ's type annotations. 
     When type-annotating a function call, 
     the arguments are type-annotated first. 
     Based on the initially inferred types of the arguments, 
     a (primary or secondary) function type is searched 
     that matches those inferred types. 
     This may or may not be found 
     (and in the latter case automatic conversions are inserted 
     to the primary input types of the function), 
     but if one exists, it must be unque to avoid an ambiguity. 
     The closure property ensures this.</p><p>Besides the closure property just explained, 
     we also ensure that the proposed new input types 
     differ from all the existing input types. 
     We maintain the uniqueness, for each function, 
     of the (primary and secondary) input types in the table, 
     so that there is exactly one overloaded method for each input type tuple. 
     Redundant calls of <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-OTHER-FUNCTION-TYPE.html">atj-other-function-type</a></span> 
     are handled before calling this function.</p><p>The <span class="v">new-in-types</span> parameter of this function 
     consist of the new proposed input types. 
     The <span class="v">old-fn-types</span> parameter 
     consists of all the existing secondary input types already in the table, 
     which we <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> through and compare against <span class="v">new-in-types</span> 
     to ensure that they are all distinct. 
     The <span class="v">all-in-typess</span> parameter of this function 
     consists of all the primary and secondary input types in the table, 
     plus <span class="v">new-in-types</span>; 
     this parameter stays constant, we do not <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> through it 
     because we need the whole collection to check the closure property. 
     We include <span class="v">new-in-types</span> 
     because the new proposed input types contribute to the closure properties: 
     they will be in the table if all the checks succeed; 
     for instance, if only <span class="v">:arational</span> is in the table 
     and we are trying to add <span class="v">:ainteger</span>, 
     their greatest lower bound is <span class="v">:ainteger</span>, 
     which will be in the table. 
     The primary function type is not included in <span class="v">old-fn-types</span> 
     because the primary input types are always checked 
     to be strictly wider than <span class="v">new-in-types</span>, 
     in <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-OTHER-FUNCTION-TYPE-FN.html">atj-other-function-type-fn</a></span>.</p>
