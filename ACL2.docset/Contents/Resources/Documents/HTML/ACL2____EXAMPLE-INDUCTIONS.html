<p>Some examples of induction schemes in ACL2</p><p>Here are some pages illustrating various induction schemes 
 suggested by recursive functions.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Classical Induction on Natural Numbers</b>: see <a href="ACL2____EXAMPLE-INDUCTION-SCHEME-NAT-RECURSION.html">example-induction-scheme-nat-recursion</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Induction Preserving Even/Odd Parity</b> or<br> 
 
 <b>Induction Downwards by 2</b> or <br> 
 
 <b>Induction with Multiple Base Cases</b>: see <a href="ACL2____EXAMPLE-INDUCTION-SCHEME-DOWN-BY-2.html">example-induction-scheme-down-by-2</a> for an induction in which the induction 
 hypothesis decreases the induction variable by an amount other than 1.  This 
 illustrates that the induction hypothesis can be about whatever term or terms 
 are needed to explain how the formula recurs.  The example also illustrates an 
 induction with more than one Base Case.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Classical Induction on Lists</b>: see <a href="ACL2____EXAMPLE-INDUCTION-SCHEME-ON-LISTS.html">example-induction-scheme-on-lists</a> for an induction over linear lists, in 
 which we inductively assume the conjecture for <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)</span> and prove it for 
 <span class="v">x</span>.  It doesn't matter whether the list is <span class="v">nil</span>-terminated or not; the 
 Base Case addresses all the possibilities.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Classical Induction on Binary (Cons) Trees</b>: see <a href="ACL2____EXAMPLE-INDUCTION-SCHEME-BINARY-TREES.html">example-induction-scheme-binary-trees</a> for an induction over the simplest form 
 of binary tree.  Here the Induction Step provides two hypotheses, one about 
 the left subtree and one about the right subtree.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Induction on Several Variables</b>: see <a href="ACL2____EXAMPLE-INDUCTION-SCHEME-ON-SEVERAL-VARIABLES.html">example-induction-scheme-on-several-variables</a> for an induction in which 
 several variables participate in the case analysis and induction 
 hypotheses.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Induction Upwards</b>: see <a href="ACL2____EXAMPLE-INDUCTION-SCHEME-UPWARDS.html">example-induction-scheme-upwards</a> for 
 an induction scheme in which the induction hypothesis is about something 
 ``bigger than'' the induction conclusion.  This illustrates that the sense in 
 which the hypothesis is about something ``smaller'' than the conclusion is 
 determined by a measure of all the variables, not the magnitude or extent of 
 some single variable.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Induction with Auxiliary Variables</b> or<br> 
 
 <b>Induction with Accumulators</b>: see <a href="ACL2____EXAMPLE-INDUCTION-SCHEME-WITH-ACCUMULATORS.html">example-induction-scheme-with-accumulators</a> for an induction scheme in which 
 one variable ``gets smaller'' but another is completely arbitrary.  Such 
 schemes are common when dealing with tail-recursive functions that accumulate 
 partial results in auxiliary variables.  This example also shows how to 
 provide several arbitrary terms in a non-inductive variable of a scheme.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Induction with Multiple Induction Steps</b>: see <a href="ACL2____EXAMPLE-INDUCTION-SCHEME-WITH-MULTIPLE-INDUCTION-STEPS.html">example-induction-scheme-with-multiple-induction-steps</a> for an induction in 
 which we make different inductive hypotheses depending on which case we're in. 
 This example also illustrates the handling of auxiliary variables or 
 accumulators.</p>
