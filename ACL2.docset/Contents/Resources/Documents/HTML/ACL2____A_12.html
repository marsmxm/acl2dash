<p>To return to the top-level of ACL2's command loop</p><p>When <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____A_12.html">a!</a>)</span> is evaluated inside of ACL2's command loop, the 
 current computation is aborted and control returns to the top of the command 
 loop, exactly as though the user had interrupted and aborted the current 
 computation.  (Note: Versions of ACL2 up to Version_3.4 provided `<span class="v">#.</span>' for 
 this purpose, but no longer; see <a href="ACL2____SHARP-DOT-READER.html">sharp-dot-reader</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p>If you are at an ACL2 prompt (as opposed to a raw Lisp break), then you may 
 type <span class="v">:a!</span> in place of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____A_12.html">a!</a>)</span>; see <a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-COMMANDS.html">keyword-commands</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For a related feature that only pops up one level, see <a href="ACL2____P_12.html">p!</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Logically speaking, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____A_12.html">a!</a>) = nil</span>.  But imagine that it is defined in 
 such a way that it causes a stack overflow or other resource exhaustion when 
 called.</p>
