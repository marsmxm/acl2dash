<p>C object designators.</p><p>In C, an object is a region of storage that contains a value [C:3.15]. 
     This notion of object is not in the sense of object-oriented programming 
     (in fact, C is not an object-oriented programming language). 
     Here we introduce a notion of object designator, 
     as an entity that (potentially) designates an object. 
     This is in line with the terminology that defines the notion of lvalue 
     [C:6.3.2/1].</p><p>At a low level, an object designator is an address in memory. 
     However, in our model, we introduce 
     a higher-level notion of object designator. 
     We start by defining a notion of abstract addresses, 
     used as top-level object designators, 
     i.e. to designate separate objects in the heap. 
     Then we allow object designators 
     to include information that selects sub-objects of the those objects, 
     and sub-sub-objects of those sub-objects, 
     and so on. 
     The selection information is of two kinds: 
     an identifier that is 
     the name of a member sub-object of a structure super-object, 
     or a natural number that is 
     the index of an element sub-object of an array super-object.</p>
