<p>Identity function used to force a hypothesis</p><p><span class="v">Force</span> is the identity function: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> x)</span> is equal to 
 <span class="v">x</span>.  However, for rules of many classes (see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>), a 
 hypothesis of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> term)</span> is given special treatment, as 
 described below.  This treatment takes place for rule classes <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> (actually in that case, the result of 
 evaluating the hypothesis metafunction call), and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>When a hypothesis of a conditional rule (of one of the classes listed 
 above) has the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> hyp)</span>, it is logically equivalent to <span class="v">hyp</span> 
 but has a pragmatic effect.  In particular, when the rule is considered, the 
 needed instance of the hypothesis, <span class="v">hyp'</span>, may be assumed if the usual 
 process fails to prove it or its negation.  In that situation, if the rule is 
 eventually applied, then a special case is generated, requiring the system to 
 prove that <span class="v">hyp'</span> is true in the current context.  The proofs of all such 
 ``forced assumptions'' are, by default, delayed until the successful 
 completion of the main goal.  See <a href="ACL2____FORCING-ROUND.html">forcing-round</a> and see <a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the only time that ACL2 gives special treatment to calls of 
 <span class="v">force</span> is when it is considering the hypotheses of a conditional rule, as 
 discussed above.  In particular, when the rewriter encounters a subterm of the 
 goal currently being simplified, a call of <span class="v">force</span> is not treated 
 specially.  For example, if you provide a <span class="v">:use</span> hint (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>) 
 that replaces a goal <span class="v">G</span> by the goal</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> ... (<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> HYP) ...)
                  concl)
         G)</pre> 
 
 <p>then the rewriter will not give any special treatment to <span class="tt">(force 
 HYP)</span>.  Instead, it will first rewrite <span class="v">HYP</span> to, say, <span class="v">HYP'</span>; and 
 then, using the fact that <span class="v">force</span> is the identity function, the rewriter 
 will return <span class="v">HYP'</span> as the rewritten value for <span class="tt">(force HYP)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Forcing is generally used on hypotheses that are always expected to be 
 true, as is commonly the case for <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of functions.  All the power 
 of the theorem prover is brought to bear on a forced hypothesis and no 
 backtracking is possible.  Forced goals can be attacked immediately (see <a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a>) or in a subsequent forcing round (see <a href="ACL2____FORCING-ROUND.html">forcing-round</a>).  Also see <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a> for a related utility.  If the 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span> of the function <span class="v">force</span> is <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d, then no hypothesis is forced.  For more on enabling and disabling 
 forcing, see <a href="ACL2____ENABLE-FORCING.html">enable-forcing</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DISABLE-FORCING.html">disable-forcing</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>It sometimes happens that a conditional rule is not applied because some 
 hypothesis, <span class="v">hyp</span>, could not be relieved, even though the required instance 
 of <span class="v">hyp</span>, <span class="v">hyp'</span>, can be shown true in the context.  This happens when 
 insufficient resources are brought to bear on <span class="v">hyp'</span> at the time we try to 
 relieve it.  A sometimes desirable alternative behavior is for the system to 
 assume <span class="v">hyp'</span>, apply the rule, and to generate explicitly a special case to 
 show that <span class="v">hyp'</span> is true in the context.  This is called ``forcing'' 
 <span class="v">hyp</span>.  It can be arranged by restating the rule so that the offending 
 hypothesis, <span class="v">hyp</span>, is embedded in a call of <span class="v">force</span>, as in <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>
 hyp)</span>.  By using the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> field of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> entry, a hypothesis can be forced without changing the statement 
 of the theorem from which the rule is derived.</p> 
 
 <p>Technically, <span class="v">force</span> is just a function of one argument that returns 
 that argument.  It is generally <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a>d and hence evaporates during 
 simplification.  But its presence among the hypotheses of a conditional rule 
 causes case splitting to occur if the hypothesis cannot be conventionally 
 relieved.</p> 
 
 <p>Since a forced hypothesis must be provable whenever the rule is otherwise 
 applicable, forcing should be used only on hypotheses that are expected always 
 to be true.</p> 
 
 <p>A particularly common situation in which some hypotheses should be forced 
 is in ``most general'' <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> lemmas.  If a single lemma 
 describes the ``expected'' type of a function, for all ``expected'' arguments, 
 then it is probably a good idea to force the hypotheses of the lemma.  Thus, 
 every time a term involving the function arises, the term will be given the 
 expected type and its arguments will be required to be of the expected type. 
 In applying this advice it might be wise to avoid forcing those hypotheses 
 that are in fact just type predicates on the arguments, since the routine that 
 applies <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> lemmas has fairly thorough knowledge of the 
 types of all terms.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Force</span> can have the additional benefit of causing the ACL2 typing 
 mechanism to interact with the ACL2 rewriter to establish the hypotheses of 
 <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules.  To understand this remark, think of the ACL2 
 type reasoning system as a rather primitive rule-based theorem prover for 
 questions about Common Lisp types, e.g., ``does this expression produce a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span>?''  ``does this expression produce some kind of ACL2 number, 
 e.g., an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a></span>, a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a></span>, or a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPLEX-RATIONALP.html">complex-rationalp</a></span>?'' etc.  It is driven by <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules. 
 To relieve the hypotheses of such rules, the type system recursively invokes 
 itself.  This can be done for any hypothesis, whether it is ``type-like'' or 
 not, since any proposition, <span class="v">p</span>, can be phrased as the type-like question 
 ``does <span class="v">p</span> produce an object of type <span class="v">nil</span>?''  However, as you might 
 expect, the type system is not very good at establishing hypotheses that are 
 not type-like, unless they happen to be assumed explicitly in the context in 
 which the question is posed, e.g., ``If <span class="v">p</span> produces a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span> then 
 does <span class="v">p</span> produce <span class="v">nil</span>?''  If type reasoning alone is insufficient to 
 prove some instance of a hypothesis, then the instance will not be proved by 
 the type system and a <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rule with that hypothesis will 
 be inapplicable in that case.  But by embedding such hypotheses in <span class="v">force</span> 
 expressions you can effectively cause the type system to ``punt'' them to the 
 rest of the theorem prover.  Of course, as already noted, this should only be 
 done on hypotheses that are ``always true.''  In particular, if rewriting is 
 required to establish some hypothesis of a <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rule, then 
 the rule will be found inapplicable because the hypothesis will not be 
 established by type reasoning alone.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 rewriter uses the type reasoning system as a subsystem.  It is 
 therefore possible that the type system will force a hypothesis that the 
 rewriter could establish.  Before a forced hypothesis is reported out of the 
 rewriter, we try to establish it by rewriting.</p> 
 
 <p>This makes the following surprising behavior possible: A <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rule fails to apply because some true hypothesis is not 
 being relieved.  The user changes the rule so as to <b>force</b> the 
 hypothesis.  The system then applies the rule but reports no forcing.  How can 
 this happen?  The type system ``punted'' the forced hypothesis to the 
 rewriter, which established it.</p> 
 
 <p>The discussion above may give the impression that a forcing round only 
 takes place because of a failure to relieve a forced hypothesis.  A notable 
 exception, however, is due to <a href="ACL2____LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">linear-arithmetic</a>.  Consider the 
 following example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> 0 x))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> 0 x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x 0)))</pre> 
 
 <p>This is not a theorem; in particular, it fails when <span class="v">x</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>. 
 What is missing is the hypothesis, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-NUMBERP.html">acl2-numberp</a> x)</span>.  If you try to prove 
 the displayed formula above and you look at the proof using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a></span>, 
 you'll see the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">But forced simplification reduces this to T, using the :executable-
counterpart of FORCE and linear arithmetic.</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, no specific rule created this forcing round (see also <a href="ACL2____FORCING-ROUND.html">forcing-round</a>).  Rather, ACL2 was able to prove the goal using linear 
 arithmetic, but it needed to force the assumption that <span class="v">x</span> is a number. 
 This is clear when we look at output for the forcing round:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">[1]Goal, below, will focus on
(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-NUMBERP.html">ACL2-NUMBERP</a> X),
which was forced in
 Goal'
  by the linearization of
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> 0 X).</pre> 
 
 <p>Finally, we should mention that the rewriter is never willing to force when 
 there is an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> term present in the goal being simplified.  Since 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a></span> terms and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a></span> terms are merely abbreviations for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> 
 terms, they also prevent forcing.  Note that <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> terms are ultimately 
 eliminated using the ordinary flow of the proof (but see <a href="ACL2____SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a>), allowing <span class="v">force</span> ultimately to function as 
 intended.  Moreover, forcing can be disabled, as described above; also see 
 <a href="ACL2____DISABLE-FORCING.html">disable-forcing</a>.</p>
