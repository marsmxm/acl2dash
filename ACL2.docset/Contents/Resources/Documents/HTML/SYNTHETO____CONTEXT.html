</dl><p>A context consists of the following components:</p><ul>
<li>A sequence of top-level constructs 
      processed so far by the static semantics. 
      This starts with the empty sequence, 
      and is extended one top-level construct after the other. 
      In Syntheto, order matters: 
      things are introduced in order, bottom-up; 
      there are no forward references allowed, 
      unless they are within explicit mutual recursion constructs.</li>
<li>A list of the type names whose definitions are being checked. 
      This is non-empty only when checking 
      a type definition 
      (in which case it contains the name of the type being defined) 
      or a type recursion 
      (in which case it contains the names of the types being defined). 
      This component is necessary to accept recursive type definitions.</li>
<li>A list of the function headers whose definitions are being checked. 
      This is non-empty only when checking 
      a function definition 
      (in which case it contains the header of the function being defined) 
      or a function recursion 
      (in which case it contains the headers of the functions being defined). 
      This component is necessary to accept recursive function definitions.</li>
<li>A variable context for the variables encountered so far and their types, 
      when checking an expression. 
      This is non-empty only if we are checking an expression.</li>
<li>A list of the typed variables 
      at the top level of the expression being checked. 
      These variables are used in the generated proof obligations, 
      where only the top-level variables count, 
      because the non-top-level variables, i.e. the let-bound variables, 
      are collected in the obligation hypotheses instead (see next item). 
      This list is non-empty only if we are checking an expression.</li>
<li>A list of the obligation hypotheses collected 
      at the current position in the Syntheto code. 
      See <span class="tt"><a href="SYNTHETO____OBLIGATION-HYP.html">obligation-hyp</a></span>. 
      This list is non-empty only if we are checking an expression.</li>
