<p>Recognizers of functions in terms.</p><p>In translated <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>s, 
     the `functions' that are applied to argument terms are 
     function symbols and lambda expressions.</p><p>The built-in predicates <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a></span> 
     recognize pseudo-terms and valid translated terms. 
     The following predicates recognize 
     lambda expressions in pseudo-terms and in valid translated terms, 
     as well as functions (in the sense above) 
     in pseudo-terms and in valid translated terms.</p><p>Note that the built-in predicate <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a></span> recognizes 
     functions in pseudo-terms that are not lambda expressions, 
     and that the predicate <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FUNCTION-SYMBOLP.html">function-symbolp</a></span> recognizes 
     functions in valid translated terms that are not lambda expressions 
     (the latter has guard <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a></span>, 
     so it must be actually preceded by a call of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a></span> 
     in guard-verified code). 
     These predicates, with the ones below, 
     provide ways to recognize all kinds of functions in terms.</p>
