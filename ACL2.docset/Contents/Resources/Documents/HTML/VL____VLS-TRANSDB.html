<p>Translations database for the VL Server.</p><p>At a first approximation, the translation database acts like an 
alist mapping <a href="VL____VL-ZIPINFO.html">vl-zipinfo</a>s to <a href="VL____VLS-DATA-P.html">vls-data-p</a> contents.  However, the 
true story is somewhat more complex due to the desire to keep zips loaded in a 
more persistent way.</p> 
 
<p>VLS must be fast enough to respond to the web server in real time.  Even 
using <a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE-READ.html">serialize-read</a> with ordinary conses, loading a single zip can take 
over a minute to load, so it is completely infeasible to imagine loading zips 
on a per-connection basis.  Instead, we need some way to keep zips 
pre-loaded.</p> 
 
<p>This is a challenge due to the number and size of our zips.  There many be 
many new zips from different projects coming into the data directory every day. 
After a short time there may be hundreds of zips to choose from.</p> 
 
<p>We think it would take too long (and perhaps too much memory) to load 
everything at once.  Instead, we will try to load zips only as the need arises. 
This might sometimes impose a 1-2 minute wait on a user who wants to get 
started with a zip that isn't already loaded.  But by showing users what zips 
are already loaded, this penalty can easily be avoided by users who don't need 
a bleeding edge zip.</p>
