<p>The three senses of well-formed ACL2 expressions or formulas</p><p>Also see <a href="ACL2____UNTRANSLATE.html">untranslate</a> for a relevant utility (and a more 
 abbreviated explanation of terms).</p>

 <p>In traditional first-order predicate calculus a ``term'' is a syntactic 
 entity denoting some object in the universe of individuals.  Often, for 
 example, the syntactic characterization of a term is that it is either a 
 variable symbol or the application of a function symbol to the appropriate 
 number of argument terms.  Traditionally, ``atomic formulas'' are built from 
 terms with predicate symbols such as ``equal'' and ``member;'' ``formulas'' 
 are then built from atomic formulas with propositional ``operators'' like 
 ``not,'' ``and,'' and ``implies.'' Theorems are formulas.  Theorems are 
 ``valid'' in the sense that the value of a theorem is true, in any model of 
 the axioms and under all possible assignments of individuals to variables.</p> 
 
 <p>However, in ACL2, terms are used in place of both atomic formulas and 
 formulas.  ACL2 does not have predicate symbols or propositional operators as 
 distinguished syntactic entities.  The ACL2 universe of individuals includes a 
 ``true'' object (denoted by <span class="v">t</span>) and a ``false'' object (denoted by 
 <span class="v">nil</span>), predicates and propositional operators are functions that return 
 these objects.  Theorems in ACL2 are terms and the ``validity'' of a term 
 means that, under no assignment to the variables does the term evaluate to 
 <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We use the word ``term'' in ACL2 in three distinct senses.  We will speak 
 of ``translated'' terms, ``untranslated'' terms, and ``pseudo-'' terms.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Translated Terms: The Strict Sense and Internal Form</i></p> 
 
 <p>In its most strict sense, a ``term'' is either a legal variable symbol, a 
 quoted constant, or the application of an n-ary function symbol or closed 
 <span class="v">lambda</span> expression to a true list of n terms.</p> 
 
 <p>The legal variable symbols are symbols other than <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span> which 
 are not in the keyword package, do not start with ampersand, do not start and 
 end with asterisks, and if in the main Lisp package, do not violate an 
 appropriate restriction (see <a href="ACL2____NAME.html">name</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Quoted constants are expressions of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a> x)</span>, where <span class="v">x</span> 
 is any ACL2 object.  Such expressions may also be written <span class="v">'x</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Closed <span class="v">lambda</span> expressions are expressions of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (v1
 ... vn) body)</span> where the <span class="v">vi</span> are distinct legal variable symbols, 
 <span class="v">body</span> is a term, and the only free variables in <span class="v">body</span> are among the 
 <span class="v">vi</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">termp</span>, which takes two arguments, an alleged term <span class="v">x</span> 
 and a logical world <span class="v">w</span> (see <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>), recognizes terms of a given 
 extension of the logic.  <span class="v">Termp</span> is defined in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode. 
 Its definition may be inspected with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> <span class="v">termp</span> for a 
 complete specification of what we mean by ``term'' in the most strict sense. 
 Most ACL2 term-processing functions deal with terms in this strict sense and 
 use <span class="v">termp</span> as a <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>.  That is, the ``internal form'' of a term 
 satisfies <span class="v">termp</span>, the strict sense of the word ``term.''</p> 
 
 <p><i>Untranslated Terms: What the User Types</i></p> 
 
 <p>While terms in the strict sense are easy to explore (because their 
 structure is so regular and simple) they can be cumbersome to type.  Thus, 
 ACL2 supports a more sugary syntax that includes uses of macros and constant 
 symbols.  Very roughly speaking, macros are functions that produce terms as 
 their results.  Constants are symbols that are associated with quoted objects. 
 Terms in this sugary syntax are ``translated'' to terms in the strict sense; 
 the sugary syntax is more often called ``untranslated.''  Roughly speaking, 
 translation just implements macroexpansion, the replacement of constant 
 symbols by their quoted values, and the checking of all the rules governing 
 the strict sense of ``term.''</p> 
 
 <p>More precisely, macro symbols are as described in the documentation for 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a></span>.  A macro, <span class="v">mac</span>, can be thought of as a function, 
 <span class="v">mac-fn</span>, from ACL2 objects to an ACL2 object to be treated as an 
 untranslated term.  For example, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAAR.html">caar</a></span> is defined as a macro symbol; 
 the associated macro function maps the object <span class="v">x</span> into the object <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span>.  A macro form is a ``call'' of a macro symbol, i.e., a list whose 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span> is the macro symbol and whose <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> is an arbitrary true 
 list of objects, used as a term.  Macroexpansion is the process of replacing 
 in an untranslated term every occurrence of a macro form by the result of 
 applying the macro function to the appropriate arguments.  The ``appropriate'' 
 arguments are determined by the exact form of the definition of the macro; 
 macros support positional, keyword, optional and other kinds of arguments. 
 See <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>In addition to macroexpansion and constant symbol dereferencing, 
 translation implements the mapping of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span> forms into 
 applications of <span class="v">lambda</span> expressions and closes <span class="v">lambda</span> expressions 
 containing free variables.  Thus, the translation of</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1_B2.html">1+</a> i))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x k))</pre> 
 
 <p>can be seen as a two-step process that first produces</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">((<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x k)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1_B2.html">1+</a> i))</pre> 
 
 <p>and then</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">((<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x k) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x k)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1_B2.html">1+</a> i) k) .</pre> 
 
 <p>Observe that the body of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> and of the first <span class="v">lambda</span> 
 expression contains a free <span class="v">k</span> which is finally bound and passed into the 
 second <span class="v">lambda</span> expression.</p> 
 
 <p>Translation also maps <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____FLET.html">flet</a></span> forms into applications of <span class="v">lambda</span> 
 expressions.  See <a href="COMMON-LISP____FLET.html">flet</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When we say, of an event-level function such as <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, that some argument ``must be a term'' we mean an untranslated term. 
 The event functions translate their term-like arguments.</p> 
 
 <p>To better understand the mapping between untranslated terms and translated 
 terms it is convenient to use the keyword command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS.html">trans</a></span> to see 
 examples of translations.  See <a href="ACL2____TRANS.html">trans</a> and also see <a href="ACL2____TRANS1.html">trans1</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we note that the theorem prover prints terms in untranslated form. 
 But there can be more than one correct untranslated term corresponding to a 
 given translated term.  For example, the translated term <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> x y 'nil)</span> 
 can be untranslated as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> x y nil)</span> and can also be untranslated as 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> x y)</span>.  The theorem prover attempts to print an untranslated term 
 that is as helpful to the user as possible.  In particular, consider a term of 
 the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> k st)</span> where <span class="v">st</span> is a single-threaded object (see <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>) and the <span class="v">kth</span> accessor of <span class="v">st</span> is, say, <span class="v">kn</span>.  The theorem 
 prover typically would expand <span class="v">(kn st)</span> to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> k st)</span>.  If <span class="v">k</span> is 
 large then it could be difficult for the user to make sense out of a proof 
 transcript that mentions the expanded term.  Fortunately, the untranslation of 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> k st)</span> would be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> *kn* st)</span>; here <span class="v">*kn*</span> would be a 
 constant (see <a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a>) added by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> event introducing 
 <span class="v">st</span>, defined to have value <span class="v">k</span>.  The user can extend this user-friendly 
 style of printing applications of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a></span> to stobjs; see <a href="ACL2____ADD-NTH-ALIAS.html">add-nth-alias</a>.  These remarks about printing applications of function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a></span> extend naturally to function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UPDATE-NTH.html">update-nth</a></span>.  Moreover, the prover 
 will attempt to treat terms as <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s for the above purpose when 
 appropriate.  For example, if function <span class="v">foo</span> has <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> <span class="v">((foo
 * st) =&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> * * * st))</span>, where <span class="v">st</span> is introduced with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st f0
 f1)</span>, then the <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> '1 (<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> '3 (foo x st0)))</span> will be 
 printed as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> *f1* (<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 3 (foo x st0)))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Pseudo-Terms: A Common Guard for Metafunctions</i></p> 
 
 <p>Because <span class="v">termp</span> is defined in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode, it cannot be 
 used effectively in conjectures to be proved.  Furthermore, from the 
 perspective of merely guarding a term processing function, <span class="v">termp</span> often 
 checks more than is required.  Finally, because <span class="v">termp</span> requires the 
 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> as one of its arguments it is impossible to use 
 <span class="v">termp</span> as a <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> in places where the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> is not 
 itself one of the arguments.</p> 
 
 <p>For these reasons we support the idea of ``pseudo-terms.''  A pseudo-term 
 is either a symbol (but not necessarily one having the syntax of a legal 
 variable symbol), a true list of length 2 beginning with <span class="v">quote</span>, or the 
 ``application of'' a symbol or pseudo <span class="v">lambda</span> expression to a true list of 
 pseudo-terms.  A pseudo <span class="v">lambda</span> expression is an expression of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (v1 ... vn) body)</span> where the <span class="v">vi</span> are all symbols and <span class="v">body</span> 
 is a pseudo-term.</p> 
 
 <p>Pseudo-terms are recognized by the unary function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span>.  If 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a> x w)</span> is true, then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> x)</span> is true.  However, if 
 <span class="v">x</span> fails to be a (strict) term it may nevertheless still be a pseudo-term. 
 For example, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> a b)</span> is not a term, because <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span> is applied to 
 the wrong number of arguments, but it is a pseudo-term.</p> 
 
 <p>The structures recognized by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> can be recursively 
 explored with the same simplicity that terms can be.  In particular, if <span class="v">x</span> 
 is not a <span class="v">variablep</span> or an <span class="v">fquotep</span>, then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FFN-SYMB.html">ffn-symb</a> x)</span> is the 
 function (<span class="v">symbol</span> or <span class="v">lambda</span> expression) and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FARGS.html">fargs</a> x)</span> is the 
 list of argument pseudo-terms.  A metafunction (see <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>) or 
 clause-processor (see <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>) may use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> as 
 the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>.</p>
