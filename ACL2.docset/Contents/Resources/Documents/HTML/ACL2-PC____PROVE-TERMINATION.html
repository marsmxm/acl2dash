<p>(macro) 
Prove termination efficiently by using a previous termination theorem.</p><pre class="code">Example:
(prove-termination f1 (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> h))

Example of typical usage:
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f2 (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>
   (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :hints
          (("Goal"
            :instructions
            ((prove-termination
              f1
              (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> h)))))))
  (f2-body x))

General Forms:
(prove-termination fn)
(prove-termination fn thy)
(prove-termination fn thy alt-thy)
(prove-termination fn thy alt-thy verbose)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">fn</span> is a known function symbol and <span class="v">thy</span> and <span class="v">alt-thy</span>, 
 when supplied and non-<span class="v">nil</span>, are <a href="ACL2____THEORY.html">theory</a> expressions.</p> 
 
 <p>This <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> macro attempts to prove a theorem, typically a 
 termination proof obligation, by applying the hint <span class="v">:termination-theorem
 fn</span> in a carefully controlled, efficient manner (using the <span class="v">:fancy-use</span> 
 <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> macro).  This proof is attempted in the theory, <span class="v">thy</span>, 
 if supplied and non-<span class="v">nil</span>, else in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a></span>.  If that 
 proof fails, then a single, ordinary prover call is made with that <span class="v">:use</span> 
 hint and in the following theory: <span class="v">alt-thy</span> if supplied and non-<span class="v">nil</span>, 
 else <span class="v">thy</span> if supplied and non-<span class="v">nil</span>, else the <a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a>. 
 If the proof has not yet succeeded and the original theory is not <span class="v">nil</span> or 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a> :here)</span>, then a final proof is attempted in the same 
 careful manner as the first proof attempt.</p> 
 
 <p>Output is inhibited by default.  However, if <span class="v">verbose</span> is <span class="v">t</span> then 
 output is as specified by the enclosing environment; and if <span class="v">verbose</span> is 
 any other non-<span class="v">nil</span> value, then output is mostly inhibited for that attempt 
 by use of the proof-builder command, <span class="v">:quiet</span>.  In all of those 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> cases for the <span class="v">verbose</span> input, a little message will be 
 started at the beginning of the second and third proof attempts, if any.</p>
