<p>ABNF grammars that generate only terminals in given sets.</p><p>If all the terminal value notations used in a rule list denote values 
     that belong to a certain set of terminals (natural numbers), 
     then the terminal strings of that rule list 
     consist of only terminals that belong to that set. 
     This is proved below.</p><p>For example, if all the terminal value notations are octets, 
     the terminal strings consist of octets 
     and can be parsed starting from character strings 
     (since <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">ACL2::characters</a> are isomorphic to octets) 
     instead of natural numbers.</p>
