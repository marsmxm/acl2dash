<p>A Flying Tour of ACL2</p><p><a href="ACL2____About_02the_02ACL2_02Home_02Page.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/large-flying.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>On this tour you will learn a little about what ACL2 is for rather than how 
 ACL2 works.  At the top and bottom of the ``page'' there are ``flying tour'' 
 icons.  Click on either icon to go to the next page of the tour.</p> 
 
 <p>The tour visits the following topics sequentially.  But on your first 
 reading, don't navigate through the tour by clicking on these links; they are 
 shown as live links only so that later you can determine what you've visited. 
 Instead, just use the flying tour icons.</p>

 <p>On your first reading, don't explore other links you see in the tour.  Some 
 of them lead to the Walking Tour, which you can take coherently when you 
 finish this tour.  Others lead into the extensive hypertext documentation and 
 you are liable to get lost there unless you're trying to answer a specific 
 question.  We intend the tour to take about 10 minutes of your time.</p>
