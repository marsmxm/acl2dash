<p>Pre-translation step performed by ATJ: 
          marking of reusable lambda-bound variables.</p><p>Consider a function body of the form</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((x ...))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((x ...))
    (f x)))</pre><p>The second <span class="v">x</span> bound by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> 
     ``overwrites'' the first one completely, 
     because in the rest of the term (namely, <span class="v">(f x)</span>) 
     only the second one is referenced, not the first one.</p><p>In contrast, consider a function body of the form</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((x ...))
  (f (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((x ...)) (f x)) (g x)))</pre><p>Here, the second <span class="v">x</span> bound by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> 
     ``overwrites'' the second one only partially, namely in <span class="v">(f x)</span>, 
     but other parts of the rest of the term, namely <span class="v">(g x)</span>, 
     reference the first one.</p><p>When we translate ACL2 to Java, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>-bound variables become Java local variables. 
     In the first example above, 
     provided that the two <span class="v">x</span> variables have the same type, 
     the Java code can use the same local variable for both: 
     for the first binding, the Java code declares and initializes the variable; 
     for the second binding, the Java code assigns to the variable, 
     destructively updating it, 
     which is safe because the old value is no longer needed. 
     However, in the second example above, 
     there have to be two distinct Java local variables, 
     say <span class="v">x1</span> and <span class="v">x2</span>, 
     corresponding to the two bound variables: 
     both are declared and initialized, 
     none can be safely destructively updated.</p><p>This pre-translation step analyzes terms 
     to find out which lambda-bound (i.e. <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>-bound) variables 
     can be reused and destructively updated. 
     The lambda-bound variables are marked as either `new' or `old': 
     the first marking means that 
     the variable must be a new Java local variable 
     that is declared and initilized; 
     the second marking means that 
     the variable can be an old Java local variable 
     that is destructively assigned. 
     These markings provide ``instructions'' to the ACL2-to-Java translation.</p><p>In the first example above the markings would be</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> (([n]x ...))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> (([o]x ...))
    (f [o]x)))</pre><p>while in the second example above the markings would be</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> (([n]x ...))
  (f (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> (([n]x ...)) (f [n]x)) (g [n]x)))</pre><p>Note that, as we mark the lambda-bound variables, 
     we must mark in the same way the occurrences in the lambda bodies, 
     to maintain the well-formedness of the ACL2 terms.</p><p>This pre-translation step must be performed after the <a href="JAVA____ATJ-PRE-TRANSLATION-TYPE-ANNOTATION.html">type annotation step</a>, so that types are kept into account: 
      a variable can be reused only if 
      it has the same type in both lambda formal parameters. 
      Since the type annotation step adds types to variable names, 
      by comparing names for equality we also compare their types for equality. 
      If two variables have different types, 
      they also have different names (since the name includes the type).</p><p>After this translation step, the <a href="JAVA____ATJ-PRE-TRANSLATION-VAR-RENAMING.html">variable renaming step</a> takes care of renaming apart ACL2 variables with the same name 
      that are both marked as `new'.</p>
