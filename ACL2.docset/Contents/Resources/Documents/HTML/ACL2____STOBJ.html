<p>Single-threaded objects or ``von Neumann bottlenecks''</p><p>In ACL2, a ``single-threaded object'' is a data structure whose use 
 is so syntactically restricted that only one instance of the object need ever 
 exist and its fields can be updated by destructive assignments.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: Novices are advised to avoid using single-threaded objects, perhaps 
 instead using <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">std::defaggregate</a> or community book 
 <span class="v">books/data-structures/structures.lisp</span>.  At the least, consider using 
 <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-VERIFY-GUARDS-EAGERNESS.html">set-verify-guards-eagerness</a></span><span class="v"> 0)</span> to avoid <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> 
 verification.</p> 
 
 <p>This topic introduces the notion of a ``stobj'', or single-threaded object. 
 It concludes with a link to a tour that introduces the use of stobjs by way of 
 examples.  We recommend that you follow that link the first time you read 
 about stobjs.  Detailed reference documentation about stobjs may be found in 
 the subtopics listed at the end below; in particular see <a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> and, 
 for so-called abstract stobjs, see <a href="ACL2____DEFABSSTOBJ.html">defabsstobj</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>As noted, a ``single-threaded object'' is a data structure whose use is so 
 syntactically restricted that only one instance of the object need ever exist. 
 Updates to the object must be sequentialized.  This allows us to update its 
 fields with destructive assignments without wrecking the axiomatic semantics 
 of update-by-copy.  For this reason, single-threaded objects are sometimes 
 called ``von Neumann bottlenecks.''</p> 
 
 <p>From the logical perspective, a single-threaded object is an ordinary ACL2 
 object, e.g., composed of integers and conses.  Logically speaking, ordinary 
 ACL2 functions are defined to allow the user to ``access'' and ``update'' its 
 fields.  Logically speaking, when fields in the object, obj, are ``updated'' 
 with new values, a new object, obj', is constructed.</p> 
 
 <p>But suppose that by syntactic means we could ensure that there were no more 
 references to the ``old'' object, obj.  Then we could create obj' by 
 destructively modifying the memory locations involved in the representation of 
 obj.  The syntactic means is pretty simple but draconian: the only reference 
 to obj is in the variable named <span class="v">OBJ</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The consequences of this simple rule are far-reaching and require some 
 getting used to.  For example, if <span class="v">OBJ</span> has been declared as a 
 single-threaded object name, then the following consequences ensue (but see 
 the discussion of congruent stobjs below for a slight relaxation).</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">OBJ</span> is a top-level global variable that contains the current object, 
 obj.</li> 
 
 <li>If a function uses the formal parameter <span class="v">OBJ</span> that is declared as a 
 stobj, the only ``actual expression'' that can be passed into that slot is the 
 variable <span class="v">OBJ</span>, not merely a term that ``evaluates to an obj''; thus, such 
 functions can only operate on the current object.  So for example, instead of 
 <span class="v">(FOO (UPDATE-FIELD1 3 ST))</span> write <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">LET</a> ((ST (UPDATE-FIELD1 3 ST))) (FOO
 ST))</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The accessors and updaters have a formal parameter named <span class="v">OBJ</span>, so by 
 the rule just above, those functions can only be applied to the current 
 object.  The recognizer is the one exception to the rule: it may be applied 
 either the <span class="v">OBJ</span> or to an ordinary (non-stobj) object.</li> 
 
 <li>The ACL2 primitives, such as <span class="v">CONS</span>, <span class="v">CAR</span> and <span class="v">CDR</span>, may not be 
 applied to the variable <span class="v">OBJ</span>.  Thus, for example, obj may not be consed 
 into a list (which would create another pointer to it) or accessed or copied 
 via ``unapproved'' means.</li> 
 
 <li>The updaters return a ``new <span class="v">OBJ</span> object'', i.e., obj'; thus, when an 
 updater is called, the only variable which can hold its result is 
 <span class="v">OBJ</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>If a function calls an <span class="v">OBJ</span> updater, it must return an <span class="v">OBJ</span> 
 object (either as the sole value returned, or in <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> ... OBJ ...)</span>; see 
 <a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a>).</li> 
 
 <li>When a top-level expression involving <span class="v">OBJ</span> returns an <span class="v">OBJ</span> 
 object, that object becomes the new current value of <span class="v">OBJ</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>There are other functional languages supporting single-threadedness, for 
 example Haskell's ``monads'' and Clean's ``uniqueness type system''.  Of 
 course, ACL2 provides a theorem prover that can prove theorems that involve 
 such constructs.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the syntactic restrictions noted above are enforced only when 
 single-threaded objects are encountered directly in the top-level loop or are 
 used in function definitions; the accessor and update functions for 
 single-threaded objects may be used without restriction in formulas to be 
 proved.  Since function evaluation is sometimes necessary during proofs, ACL2 
 must be able to evaluate these functions on logical constants representing the 
 object, even when the constant is not ``the current object.''  Thus, ACL2 
 supports both the efficient von Neumann semantics and the clean applicative 
 semantics, and uses the first in contexts where execution speed is paramount 
 and the second during proofs.</p>

 See <a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> for more details about stobjs.  In particular, a 
 relatively advanced notion of ``congruent stobjs'' is discussed there.  The 
 idea is to allow a stobj, <span class="v">st2</span>, of the same ``shape'' as a given stobj, 
 <span class="v">st1</span>, to be used in place of <span class="v">st1</span>.  Other <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> keywords 
 allow inlining and renaming of stobj accessors and updaters.</p> 
 
 <p>But we are getting ahead of ourselves.  To start the stobj tour recommended 
 earlier in this topic, see <a href="ACL2____STOBJ-EXAMPLE-1.html">stobj-example-1</a>.</p>
