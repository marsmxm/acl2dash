<p>Proof tree displays</p><p>A view of ACL2 proofs may be obtained by way of ``proof tree 
 displays,'' which appear in proof output (see <a href="ACL2____PROOFS-CO.html">proofs-co</a>) when 
 proof-tree output is enabled (see below) When ACL2 starts a proof and 
 proof-tree output is enabled, the proof output begins with the following 
 string.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">&lt;&lt; Starting proof tree logging &gt;&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Then for each goal encountered during the proof, a corresponding proof tree 
 display (as described below) is printed into the proof output: first the 
 characters in the constant string <span class="v">*proof-tree-start-delimiter*</span> are 
 printed, then the proof tree display, and finally the characters in the 
 constant string <span class="v">*proof-tree-end-delimiter*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>External tools may present proof tree displays in a separate window.  In 
 particular, a tool distributed with the ACL2 community books customizes the 
 emacs environment to provide window-based proof tree displays together with 
 commands for traversing the proof transcript; see the discussion of ``ACL2 
 proof-tree support'' in file <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> distributed with 
 ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>The command <span class="v">:start-proof-tree</span> enables proof-tree output, while 
 <span class="v">:stop-proof-tree</span> disables proof-tree output; see <a href="ACL2____START-PROOF-TREE.html">start-proof-tree</a> 
 and see <a href="ACL2____STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is an example of a proof tree display, with comments.  Lines marked 
 with ``c'' are considered ``checkpoints,'' i.e., goals whose scrutiny may be 
 of particular value.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)    ;currently proving PLUS-TREE-DEL

   2 |  Goal' simp     ;"Goal'" creates 2 subgoals by simplification

     |  &lt;5 more subgoals&gt;      ; created 6 top-level subgoals.  At
                               ; this point, one of those 6 has been
                               ; proved, and 5 remain to be proved.
                               ; We are currently working on the
                               ; first of those 5 remaining goals.</pre> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE-EXAMPLES.html">proof-tree-examples</a> for many examples that contain proof tree 
 displays.  But first, we summarize the kinds of lines that may appear in a 
 proof tree display.  The simplest form of a proof tree display is a header 
 showing the current event, followed by list of lines, each having one of the 
 following forms.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">n &lt;goal&gt; &lt;process&gt; ...</pre> 
 
 <p>Says that the indicated goal created <span class="v">n</span> subgoals using the indicated 
 process.  Here ``...'' refers to possible additional information.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">c   n &lt;goal&gt; &lt;process&gt; ...</pre> 
 
 <p>As above, but calls attention to the fact that this goal is a 
 ``checkpoint'' in the sense that it may be of particular interest.  Some 
 displays may overwrite ``c'' with ``&gt;'' to indicate the current checkpoint 
 being shown in the proof transcript.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">|  &lt;goal&gt; ...
|  |  &lt;k subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Indicates that the goal just above this line, which is pointed to by the 
 rightmost vertical bar (``|''), has <span class="v">k</span> subgoals, none of which have yet 
 been processed.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">|  &lt;goal&gt; ...
|  |  &lt;k more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>As above, except that some subgoals have already been processed.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</pre> 
 
 <p>Separates successive passes through the ``waterfall''.  Thus, this 
 ``fencepost'' mark indicates the start of a new proof by induction or of a new 
 forcing round.</p>
