<p>Syntax and meaning of rules and abbreviations for <a href="STD____DEFRETGEN.html">defretgen</a> 
          and <a href="STD____DEFRET-MUTUAL-GENERATE.html">defret-mutual-generate</a></p> 
 
<p>The <a href="STD____DEFRETGEN.html">defretgen</a> and <a href="STD____DEFRET-MUTUAL-GENERATE.html">defret-mutual-generate</a> macros produce <a href="ACL2____DEFRET.html">defret</a> forms by applying a series of rules to functions.  Each rule is a pair 
<span class="v">(condition actions)</span> where if the condition is satisfied by the function, 
the actions modify that function's <span class="v">defret</span> form.  The rules may be written 
directly by the user or generated using some abbreviations, discussed 
below.</p> 
 
<h4>Condition language</h4> 
 
<p>The condition under which a rule applies may be a Boolean formula using 
AND/OR/NOT, T and NIL, and the following checks:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(:has-formal &lt;io-var-test&gt;)</span> checks that the function has a formal 
satisfying the specified input/output variable test; see the section on 
input/output conditions below.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(:has-return &lt;io-var-test&gt;)</span> checks that the 
function has a return value satisfying the given criteria, simple to 
<span class="v">has-formal</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(:fnname name)</span> only applies to the given function.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:recursive</span>, <span class="v">:nonrec</span>, <span class="v">:mutrec</span>, <span class="v">:constrained</span> check 
whether the function is of that type, where <span class="v">:recursive</span> means singly 
recursive.</li> 
 
</ul> 
<p>See the function <span class="v">dmgen-eval-condition</span> for implementation.</p> 
 
<h4>Input/output variable conditions</h4> 
 
<p>Several conditions and actions have tests on input/output variables. These 
are constructed as Boolean (and/or/not) combinations of the following base 
tests:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:type type-name)</span> tests the type of the formal or return value</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:prop property)</span>  tests whether the given property is present</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:name name)</span>      tests whether the name of the formal or return value matches.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>As a special case, a single base test can be written with the keyword and 
value spliced into the condition or action form; that is, the following two 
conditions are equivalent:</p> 
<pre class="code">(:has-formal (:type foo))
(:has-formal :type foo)</pre> 
 
<h4>Actions</h4> 
 
<p>An action may be any of the following:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:add-hyp term)</span> adds <span class="v">term</span> as a top-level hypothesis.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:add-concl term)</span> adds <span class="v">term</span> as a conclusion, conjoined with any others.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:add-bindings . bindings)</span> adds the given <span class="v">B*</span> bindings, after 
binding the return values but outside of both the hyps and conclusions.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(:each-formal &lt;io-var-test&gt; :var var :action action)</span>, where each 
action is an <span class="v">:add-hyp</span>, <span class="v">:push-hyp</span> or <span class="v">:add-concl</span> form, adds the 
given hyp or conclusion for each formal matching the io-var-test criteria, with 
<span class="v">var</span> in these actions replaced by the name of the formal.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(:each-return &lt;io-var-test&gt; :var var :action action)</span>, 
similar to <span class="v">each-formal</span> but acts on return values instead of formals.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(:push-hyp term)</span> pushes <span class="v">term</span> as a hypothesis for any conclusions 
added subsequently until it is popped off the stack with <span class="v">(:pop-hyp)</span>.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:pop-hyp)</span> removes the most recently pushed hypothesis so it won't 
affect subsequent conclusions added.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(:add-keyword key val ...)</span> adds the keyword/value pairs as arguments 
to the resulting <span class="v">defret</span> form; typical keys to use are <span class="v">:hints</span> and 
<span class="v">:rule-classes</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(:set-thmname template)</span> sets the theorem name template for the 
<span class="v">defret</span> to the given symbol, which may include the substring <span class="v">&lt;FN&gt;</span> 
which is replaced by the name of the function.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h4>Common Abbreviations</h4> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">defretgen</span> and <span class="v">defret-mutual-generate</span> macros support some other keywords 
besides :rules, each of which generates rules according to some common usage 
patterns.  Note that the ordering of rules is significant for the behavior of 
<span class="v">:push-hyp</span>/<span class="v">:pop-hyp</span> and <span class="v">:add-concl</span>.  The rules generated by these 
abbreviations are considered before the explicit <span class="v">:rules</span>; this means that 
any conclusions generated by <span class="v">:return-concls</span> will not be affected by any 
<span class="v">:push-hyp</span> forms from the <span class="v">:rules</span>.</p> 
 
<h5><span class="v">:formal-hyps</span></h5> 
 
<p>This keyword generates hypotheses based on the names/types/properties of formals.  Its 
argument is a list of elements of one of the following forms:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(formalname hyp-term [ &lt;io-var-test&gt; ])</span> adds the given hyp to the 
theorem of any function with a formal of the given name.  If an io-var-test is 
given, it will only be added if that formal satisfies it.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">((type-pred name) hyp-term)</span> adds the given hyp term for every formal 
of the given type, binding that formal to <span class="v">name</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(&lt;io-var-test&gt; name hyp-term)</span> adds the given hyp for every formal 
satisfying the given io-var-test, binding that formal to <span class="v">name</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h5><span class="v">:return-concls</span></h5> 
<p>This keyword generates hypotheses based on the names/types of return values. 
Its argument is a list of elements similar to those of <span class="v">:formal-hyps</span>.</p> 
 
<h5><span class="v">:function-keys</span></h5> 
<p>This keyword adds hints or other keywords to the theorems corresponding to 
function names. For example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">:function-keys
   ((rewrite-term-list
      :hints ('(:expand ((termlist-vars x)))))</pre>
