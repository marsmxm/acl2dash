<p>Event generation performed by <span class="tt"><a href="APT____TAILREC.html">tailrec</a></span>.</p><p>Some events are generated in two slightly different variants: 
                 one that is local to the generated <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html"><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span></a>, and one that is exported from the <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html"><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span></a>. Proof hints are in the former but not in the latter, 
                 thus keeping the ACL2 history ``clean''; 
                 some proof hints may refer to events 
                 that are generated only locally to the <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html"><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span></a>.</p><p>Some events are generated only locally to the generated <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html"><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span></a>. These are auxiliary events 
                 needed to introduce the non-local (i.e. exported) events, 
                 but whose presence in the ACL2 history is no longer needed 
                 once the exported events have been introduced. 
                 These only-local events have generated fresh names. 
                 In contrast, exported events have names 
                 that are user-controlled, directly or indirectly.</p>
