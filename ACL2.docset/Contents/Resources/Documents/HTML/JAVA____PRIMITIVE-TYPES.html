<p>Java primitive types [JLS:4.2].</p><p>We formalize Java primitive types as syntactic entities. 
     Primitive values are formalized <a href="JAVA____PRIMITIVE-VALUES.html">here</a>.</p><p>According to the grammar rule for <span class="v">primitive-type</span> [JLS:4.2], 
     primitive types (as syntactic entities) include annotations. 
     The grammar also includes a rule for <span class="v">unann-primitive-type</span> [JLS:8.3], 
     which captures the ``core'' eight primitive types without annotations, 
     as they were in the pre-annotations versions of Java. 
     However, note that the rules for 
     <span class="v">integral-type</span>, <span class="v">floating-point-type</span>, and <span class="v">numeric-type</span> 
     do not include annotations, 
     even though integral, floating-point, and numeric types 
     are considered a subset of the primitive types.</p><p>For our formalization, 
     it seems more practical to define the `primitive types' 
     as the ones without annotations, 
     and have a separate notion for `annotated primitive types'. 
     This is just nomenclature, the substance does not change.</p><p>For now we just define (unannotated) primitive types. 
     Annotated primitive types will be added later.</p><p>We also formalize the subtype relation on primitive types [JLS:4.10].</p>
