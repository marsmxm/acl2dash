<p>Some possible ways to work around <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> failures</p><p>This topic provides some ideas for how to deal with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> failures.  Ideally, this topic will continue to grow over 
 time.</p> 
 
 <p>Stack overflows may show up as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">***********************************************
************ ABORTING from raw Lisp ***********
********** (see :DOC raw-lisp-error) **********
Error:  Stack overflow on value stack.
***********************************************</pre> 
 
 <p>When this occurs during book certification, it could be during an attempt 
 to handle large objects, in particular by the <a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE.html">serialize</a> writer or by a 
 <a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a>d version of the check for ``bad'' objects.  These two potential 
 causes can be remedied by first evaluating the following forms, 
 respectively.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-SERIALIZE-CHARACTER-SYSTEM.html">set-serialize-character-system</a> nil state)
(<a href="ACL2____SET-BAD-LISP-CONSP-MEMOIZE.html">set-bad-lisp-consp-memoize</a> nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>If the large object is in an event in the book under certification, then 
 you may need to avoid printing it, as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a> '(<a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> event))</pre> 
 
 <p>Other failures of <span class="v">certify-book</span> may have error messages that point to 
 the problem.  When that is not the case, it would be good to explain possible 
 workarounds in this topic!</p>
