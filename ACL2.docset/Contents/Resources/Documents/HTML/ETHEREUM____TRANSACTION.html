<p>Fixtype of transactions.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p>

</dl><p>A transaction is a 9-tuple [YP:(15)]. 
     The type of each component is specified in [YP:(16)].</p><p>We use <a href="ETHEREUM____WORDS.html">words</a> to model natural numbers in \mathbb{N}_{256}: 
     this is the type of the nonce, gas price, gas limit, and value fields.</p><p>The type of the recipient field is <span class="tt"><a href="ETHEREUM____MAYBE-BYTE-LIST20.html">maybe-byte-list20</a></span>. 
     See the documentation of that fixtype for details.</p><p>The sixth component of the tuple is always a byte array, 
     whether it is initialization code (when the recipient is <span class="v">nil</span>) 
     or it is data (when the recipient is an address).</p><p>The remaining three components are for the signature. 
     The \mathbf{r} and \mathbf{s} components are words. 
     The other signature component is 
     \mathbf{v} in the text that describes it in [YP:4.2], 
     but it is denoted as T_{\mathrm{w}} in [YP:(15)] and [YP:(16)] 
     (presumably to avoid a conflict with 
     the T_{\mathrm{v}} value component). 
     We pick <span class="v">sign-v</span> (instead of <span class="v">sign-w</span>) 
     for the corresponding field name in our product fixtype. 
     However, there is an issue with the type of this component: 
     [YP:(16)] says that it is a natural number below 32, 
     but [YP:F] says that T_{\mathrm{w}} may be 
     a chain identifier doubled plus 35 or 36, 
     in which case it is above 32. 
     It looks like [YP:F] was updated according to [EIP155], 
     while [YP:4.2] was not; 
     this EIP describes an improved signature scheme 
     that involves chain identifiers. 
     [EIP155] lists some chain identifiers, one of which is larger than a byte. 
     So we use the library type <a href="FTY____BASETYPES.html"><span class="v">nat</span></a> 
     for this component of a transaction.</p>
