<p>Release notes for the ACL2 Community Books for ACL2 7.0 (January 
 2015)</p><p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> between the releases of ACL2 6.5 and 7.0.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/wiki/Release-version-numbers" target="_blank"><nobr>acl2-books 
 Wiki page on Release Version Numbers<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/wiki/Release-version-numbers"></nobr></a> gives the Git/SVN revision numbers 
 corresponding to releases.  See also <a href="ACL2____NOTE-7-0.html">note-7-0</a> for the changes made to 
 ACL2 itself.  For additional details, you may also see the raw <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master" target="_blank"><nobr>commit log<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <h2>Organizational, Build System, and Name Changes</h2> 
 
 
 <h3>Source Code Moved</h3> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 Community Books and ACL2 System source code repositories have been 
 merged into one repository and are now available at</p> 
 
 <div class="box"><p><a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2" target="_blank"><nobr>https://github.com/acl2/acl2<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2"></nobr></a></p></div> 
 
 <p>See the <span class="v">Readme.md</span> file found there for more details.  See also the 
 <a href="ACL2____GIT-QUICK-START.html">git-quick-start</a> guide if you are interested in contributing.</p> 
 
 
 
 <h3>Deleted Stubs</h3> 
 
 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous 
 location to help you transition your <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> commands.  The <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> build system prints warnings when a stub book is being 
 included.</p> 
 
 <p>Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books were stubs 
 in ACL2 6.5, so we've deleted them.</p>

 <h3>Build System Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">arithmetic-2</span> library is no longer built by default when running an 
 ordinary <span class="v">make</span>.  All books that previously depended on <span class="v">arithmetic-2</span> 
 have been transitioned to use <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span> instead.  If your own work 
 depends on <span class="v">arithmetic-2</span>, you can still build these books, e.g., by running 
 <span class="v">make arithmetic-2</span> in the <span class="v">books</span> directory.</p> 
 
 <p>Many minor tweaks and cleanups have been made to the build system 
 itself.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">cert.pl</span> now has better support for <a href="ACL2____PROVISIONAL-CERTIFICATION.html">provisional-certification</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>The <a href="BUILD____CERT_F5PARAM.html">build::cert_param</a> mechanism, which is used by <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> to indicate that books have special requirements, is now 
 documented.</li> 
 
 <li>New <span class="v">cert_param</span> directives have been added to avoid certifying certain 
 books on incompatible Lisps.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> now better avoids overflowing the maximum number of 
 arguments to shell commands on some platforms when certifying large numbers of 
 books.</li> 
 
 <li>The new <span class="v">:ignore-certs</span> feature of <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> is now used in 
 special two-pass books like <span class="v">std/strings/defs-program.lisp</span>, and should help 
 to make building these books more reliable.</li> 
 
 <li>Hundreds of old Makefiles from the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION-CLASSIC.html">books-certification-classic</a> era 
 have been eliminated.  Some obsolete GCL-specific directives have also been 
 eliminated.</li> 
 
 <li>Installing <a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">quicklisp</a> now works from behind a proxy.  See <i>Using a 
 Proxy</i> in <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION.html">books-certification</a> for details.</li> 
 
 <li>The implementation of ``<span class="v">make everything</span>'' has been cleaned up.  In 
 particular, it no longer sets <span class="v">USE_QUICKLISP=1</span> since this is not 
 appropriate for some Lisps.</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">make clean</span> command now does a better job of cleaning up generated 
 files.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Numerous books have been patched up for better portability across Lisps and 
 integration with ACL2(p).  For instance: In many cases, previous calls of <a href="ACL2____WITHOUT-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">without-waterfall-parallelism</a> are no longer necessary, largely due to 
 thread-safe memoization; several <a href="ACL2____OSLIB.html">oslib</a> functions have been extended to 
 work on additional Lisps; many books with raw Lisp code now use <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-RAW.html">include-raw</a> for more portable compilation behavior across Lisps.</p> 
 
 <p>Various other utilities have been made more reliable.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>For Emacs <span class="v">TAGS</span> users, the <span class="v">etags.sh</span> script has been improved to 
 permit whitespace before definitions.</li> 
 
 <li>For ACL2 packaging mechanisms, the <span class="v">fix-cert</span> utility has been improved 
 and now includes scripts for moving ACL2 distributions.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Supporting scripts for the <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/" target="_blank"><nobr>Jenkins<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://jenkins-ci.org/"></nobr></a> 
 continuous integration server can now be found in the <span class="v">build/jenkins</span> 
 directory.  These scripts have received significant attention and can now 
 support multi-configuration builds for checking ACL2 books compatibility with 
 many host Lisps.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Name Conflict Resolution</h3> 
 
 <p>Progress has been made toward resolving name clashes in order to be able to 
 include more books together.  This work involves renaming certain lemmas and 
 may require updates to your books.</p> 
 
 <p>Arithmetic-2</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 <li>
<span class="v">floor-mod-elim</span> no longer forces its hypothesis.</li> 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Arithmetic-5</p> 
 <ul> 
 <li>
<span class="v">floor-=-x/y</span> now has additional corollaries.</li> 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>IHS</p> 
 <ul> 
 <li>
<span class="v">floor-mod-elim</span> no longer forces its hypothesis.</li> 
 <li>
<span class="v">floor-=-x/y</span> now has additional corollaries.</li> 
 <li>
<span class="v">justify-floor-recursion</span> has been renamed to <span class="v">floor-recursion</span>.</li> 
 <li>
<span class="v">cancel-floor-+</span> has been renamed to <span class="v">cancel-floor-+-basic</span>.</li> 
 <li>
<span class="v">cancel-mod-+</span> has been renamed to <span class="v">cancel-mod-+-basic</span>.</li> 
 <li>
<span class="v">rationalp-mod</span> no longer requires <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> x)</span>.</li> 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>COI/osets</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Many <span class="v">coi/osets</span> books are now just small wrappers around <span class="v">std/osets</span> 
 books.</li> 
 
 <li>COI's <span class="v">double-containment</span> rule has been renamed to 
 <span class="v">double-containment-expensive</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 
 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>Robert Krug's <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span> library of is now available under a 
 BSD-3-Clause style license instead of the GNU General Public License.</p> 
 
 <p>Several books contributed by David Rager, which were formerly released under 
 the GNU General Public License or a BSD-3-Clause style license, are now instead 
 released under a (more permissive) MIT/X11-style license.</p> 
 
 <p>Several books contributed by Oracle, which were formerly released under the 
 GNU General Public License, are now instead released under an MIT/X11-style 
 license.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____UBDDS.html">ubdds</a> library and a few "miscellaneous" books have also been 
 transitioned from the GNU General Public License to a 3-clause BSD style 
 license.</p> 
 
 <p>Several books in the <span class="v">coi</span> library, which previously lacked explicit 
 license information, now have explicit MIT/X11-style licenses.</p> 
 
 
 <h2>New Libraries and Documentation</h2> 
 
 <p>The ACL2+Books manual has a great deal of new and improved content and many 
 topics have been reorganized to provide a more coherent hierarchy.  Notably, 
 all documentation in the legacy <i>defdoc</i> format has been rewritten into 
 the <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> format.  Some highlights:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____IHS.html">ihs</a> documentation has been considerably updated.</li> 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____DEFSORT.html">defsort</a> macro is now documented.</li> 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____SNEAKY.html">sneaky</a> documentation has been considerably expanded.</li> 
 <li>Topics like <a href="ACL2____LISTS.html">lists</a>, <a href="ACL2____STRINGS.html">strings</a>, <a href="ACL2____ALISTS.html">alists</a>, etc., now 
 group together some related <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> functions.</li> 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 <a href="ACL2____SIDEKICK.html">Sidekick</a> is an experimental and very preliminary graphical 
 add-on to ACL2.  It currently features a session viewer, theory linter, a 
 horribly primitive interface to the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>, and a slick 
 <i>Lookup</i> feature that can show you documentation and other information 
 about various symbols.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">system/toothbrush</span> directory provides a way to create 
 applications with ACL2 that have a much smaller memory footprint than an 
 ordinary ACL2 <a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> image.  See the <span class="v">README</span> file in this 
 directory for more information.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="DEPGRAPH____DEPGRAPH.html">depgraph::depgraph</a> library now contains a few algorithms for 
 working with dependency graphs.  It provides <a href="DEPGRAPH____TOPOSORT.html">depgraph::toposort</a>, a 
 topological sort, <a href="DEPGRAPH____INVERT.html">depgraph::invert</a>, an edge-inversion algorithm, and 
 <a href="DEPGRAPH____TRANSDEPS.html">depgraph::transdeps</a>, which can compute the transitive dependencies for a 
 set of nodes.  This functionality was formerly part of <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> but has now 
 been made more general and extracted.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">projects/codewalker/</span> directory contains Codewalker, a utility 
 for exploring code in any programming language specified by an ACL2 model to 
 discover certain properties of the code.  Demos of Codewalker are also in that 
 directory.</p> 
 
 <p>The new directory <span class="v">projects/hybrid-systems/</span> is a 
 specification/verification project by Shant Harutuntian using ACL2(r) (see 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>), in support of his 2007 Ph.D. dissertation, with a few recent 
 updates (because of ACL2 changes) made by Cuong Chau.</p> 
 
 <p>There are also several new small tools and books.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>(CCL Only) The new <a href="ACL2____SPACEWALK.html">spacewalk</a> tool can be used to get a report about 
 heap memory usage.  It may be useful for identifying unusually large functions 
 and constants in your ACL2 session.</li> 
 
 <li>The new <a href="ACL2____SIMP.html">simp</a> tool can be used to ask ACL2 to simplify terms under 
 certain hypotheses.</li> 
 
 <li>The new tool <span class="v">misc/check-fn-inst</span> can be used to check the constraints 
 to a functional instantiation.</li> 
 
 <li>The new tool, <a href="ACL2____DEF-SAVED-OBLIGS.html">def-saved-obligs</a>, can be used to save proof 
 obligations for an event as independent defthms.</li> 
 
 <li>The new tool, <span class="v">system/dead-source-code.lisp</span>, may be useful 
 for finding dead code in the ACL2 sources.</li> 
 
 <li>The new books <span class="v">system/cantor-pairing-bijective.lisp</span> and 
 <span class="v">system/hl-nat-combine-onto.lisp</span> contain proofs of bijectivity and 
 surjectivity (one-one/onto and onto, respectively) of cantor-pairing 
 functions.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h2>Changes to Major Libraries</h2> 
 
 <h3>XDOC Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>The web-based XDOC viewer has been improved.  It now uses newer versions of 
 the JQuery and Typeahead libraries.  Some bugs with the typeahead (jump to) box 
 have been fixed and it has been extended to show more results.  The jump-to box 
 has been extended with a <span class="v">Alt+/</span> hotkey (or perhaps some other key 
 combination like <span class="v">Ctrl+/</span>, depending on your browser).  Middle clicking on 
 XDOC links should now properly open them in new tabs and the fonts have been 
 updated.  Some ugly quotes are now replaced by ``smart'' replacements.</p> 
 
 <p>Significant work has been done to try to make XDOC content accessible to 
 search engines such as Google.  A new PHP script largely replaces previous 
 failed efforts to generate "static" HTML files, site maps, and so forth.</p> 
 
 <p>XDOC now supports "resource directories" for incorporating images, PDF 
 files, and other kinds of resources.  See <a href="XDOC____ADD-RESOURCE-DIRECTORY.html">xdoc::add-resource-directory</a> 
 for details.</p> 
 
 <p>XDOC now features <a href="XDOC____KATEX-INTEGRATION.html">xdoc::katex-integration</a> for writing LaTeX-like 
 formulas like  \left( \sum_{i=0}^{n} \sqrt{f(i)} \right) &lt;
 \frac{n^2}{k}  within your documentation.  Note that ACL2's new <a href="ACL2____FANCY-STRING-READER.html">fancy-string-reader</a> can be used to make escaping simpler, and this may be 
 especially useful when trying to write LaTeX-like formulas, where the escaping 
 of <span class="v">\</span> characters can be irritating.</p> 
 
 <p>There are also many other minor changes:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____DEFPOINTER.html">defpointer</a> macro has been integrated into XDOC itself.  (It was 
 formerly only part of the ACL2 system documentation.)</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____DEFSECTION.html">defsection</a> and <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> now permit plain strings to be included 
 among the list of events.  These strings are incorporated into the resulting 
 documentation as running commentary.</li> 
 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a>, <a href="ACL2____DEFSECTION.html">defsection</a>, and <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> macros now all 
 evaluate the arguments to <span class="v">:short</span> and <span class="v">:long</span> instead of quoting them. 
 This may make it more convenient to write macros that produce documentation 
 from boilerplate templates, e.g., you can now directly write things like 
 <span class="v">:short (cat ...)</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>Tweaked <a href="ACL2____DEFSECTION.html">defsection</a> so that you can give <span class="v">:extension (foo)</span> 
 instead of just <span class="v">:extension foo.</span>
</li> 
 
 <li>Better error handling on <a href="ACL2____XDOC-EXTEND.html">xdoc-extend</a> and <a href="XDOC____XDOC-PREPEND.html">xdoc::xdoc-prepend</a>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 
 
 <h3>
<a href="ACL2____STD.html">std</a> Library Changes</h3> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2BASIC.html">std/basic</a></h5> 
 
 <p>Added <a href="ACL2____TUPLEP.html">tuplep</a> and <a href="ACL2____IMPOSSIBLE.html">impossible</a>.</p> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS.html">std/lists</a></h5> 
 
 <p>Cleaned up rules about take in <a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS_F2TAKE.html">std/lists/take</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____REPLICATE.html">replicate</a> is now an alias for <a href="ACL2____REPEAT.html">repeat</a> and is compatible with 
 the definition of <span class="v">repeat</span> in the COI libraries, fixing a longstanding 
 incompatibility.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____ALL-EQUALP.html">all-equalp</a> function has been added.</p> 
 
 <p>Several lemmas about <a href="ACL2____INTERSECTION_42.html">intersection$</a>, <a href="ACL2____INTERSECTP.html">intersectp</a>, and <a href="ACL2____SET-DIFFERENCE_42.html">set-difference$</a> have been extracted from <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> and moved into 
 <span class="v">std/lists</span>.  See for instance <a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS_F2INTERSECTION_42.html">std/lists/intersection$</a>, 
 <a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS_F2INTERSECTP.html">std/lists/intersectp</a>, and <a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS_F2SET-DIFFERENCE.html">std/lists/set-difference</a>.</p> 
 
 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2UTIL.html">std/util</a></h5> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> binders for <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">std::defaggregate</a>s now also bind the 
 variable, fixing a longstanding issue.  Also, the syntax <span class="v">((prodname name))</span> 
 is now permitted as an abbreviation for <span class="v">((prodname name) name)</span>.  (This is 
 often useful when destructuring a function's arguments).</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> binders for <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">std::defaggregate</a> (and also <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>) are now extensible and can translate bindings like <span class="v">x.foo</span> 
 into calls of user-defined functions.  See the description of <i>Extra Binder 
 Names</i> in the documentation of <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">std::defaggregate</a> for details.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="STD____DEFLIST.html">std::deflist</a>, <a href="STD____DEFALIST.html">std::defalist</a>, <a href="STD____DEFPROJECTION.html">std::defprojection</a>, 
 and <a href="STD____DEFMAPAPPEND.html">std::defmapappend</a> macros are now "pluggable" and can be extended 
 with additional theorems; see for instance the new book 
 <span class="v">std/lists/abstract.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The new books <span class="v">std/util/deflist-base</span> and <span class="v">std/util/defalist-base</span> 
 offer lighter-weight alternative to <span class="v">std/util/deflist</span> and 
 <span class="v">std/util/defalist</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFRULE.html">defrule</a> book now has fewer dependencies.</p> 
 
 <p>Documentation for <a href="STD____DEFLIST.html">std::deflist</a> has been improved.  <span class="v">Deflist</span> now 
 uses <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> so that you get a signature block in the resulting 
 documentation.  The documentation for automatically generated deflist events is 
 now put in a more sensible order and split off into a <span class="v">foolistp-basics</span> 
 section underneath of <span class="v">foolistp</span>, to reduce the prominence of this 
 "boilerplate" documentation.  Deflist can now also create documentation even 
 in the <span class="v">already-definedp</span> case.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed an obscure bug with <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a>'s return-specifiers that could 
 affect non-executable functions that involve stobjs.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> macro now interprets <span class="v">:inline nil</span> as "make this a 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NOTINLINE.html">$notinline</a> function" instead of 
 "make this a regular function instead of an <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-INLINE.html">inline</a> one."</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a>, <a href="ACL2____DEFINES.html">defines</a>, and also the <a href="FTY____DEFFIXEQUIV.html">fty::deffixequiv</a> 
 macros now have improved, more advanced default hints set for inductive proofs 
 in return specs and <span class="v">deffixequiv(-mutual)</span> forms.</p> 
 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2STRINGS.html">std/strings</a></h5> 
 
 <p>Certification time has been improved.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">fast-cat</span> book (see <a href="STR____CAT.html">str::cat</a>) now uses <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-RAW.html">include-raw</a> to 
 avoid possible issues on various Lisps.</p> 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">std/io</a></h5> 
 
 <p>Added <a href="ACL2____READ-FILE-AS-STRING.html">read-file-as-string</a> function.</p> 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2ALISTS.html">std/alists</a></h5> 
 
 <p>There are some new functions: <a href="ACL2____FAL-FIND-ANY.html">fal-find-any</a> and <a href="ACL2____FAL-ALL-BOUNDP.html">fal-all-boundp</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Moved <a href="ACL2____WORTH-HASHING.html">worth-hashing</a> into <span class="v">std/alists</span> from 
 <span class="v">misc/hons-help</span>.</p> 
 
 <h5><a href="ACL2____STD_F2TYPED-LISTS.html">std/typed-lists</a></h5> 
 
 <p>Move <a href="ACL2____CONS-LISTP.html">cons-listp</a> and <a href="ACL2____CONS-LIST-LISTP.html">cons-list-listp</a> out of VL and into 
 <span class="v">std/typed-lists</span>.</p> 
 
 
 
 <h3>Defdata (Data Definition Framework)</h3> 
 
 <p> <span class="v">Defdata</span> has undergone significant improvements.  Automated theorem 
 proving support has been increased by a tight integration with <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">Tau-system</a>.  A significant new capability is the support for parametric 
 polymorphism via <span class="v">sig</span> rules. There have been many improvements in its 
 engineering too.</p> 
 
 <h5>Tau Integration</h5> 
 <p> 
 Defdata analyzes the predicate definition of every new type and, if 
 possible, produces a set of Tau rules that completely characterize 
 the type. Defdata thus provides the following guarantee: If Tau is 
 complete over the type reasoning theory, then adding a type to the 
 current theory via <span class="v">defdata</span> preserves completeness. 
 </p> 
 
 <h5>Parametric Polymorphism</h5> 
 <p> 
 Defdata provides a new macro <span class="v">sig</span> which can be used to define 
 signatures of polymorphic functions 
 such as <span class="tt">append</span>, <span class="tt">remove1</span>, <span class="tt">put-assoc</span> etc: 
 </p> 
 <pre class="code">(sig append ((listof :a) (listof :a)) =&gt; (listof :a))
(sig remove1-equal (all (listof :a)) =&gt; (listof :a))
(sig put-assoc-equal (:a :b (alistof :a :b)) =&gt; (alistof :a :b))</pre> 
 
 <p> 
 Defdata automatically instantiates these generic theorems 
 (type signatures) for previously defined types and as new types are defined 
 after the <span class="v">sig</span> forms. Defdata, thus implements parametric polymorphism, by 
 providing the following invariants:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 <li> Every new defdata type is instantiated for every polymorphic 
      signature (specified via sig) that matches (one of its argument 
      types).</li> 
 <li> Every new polymorphic signature is appropriately instantiated for 
      all defdata types of the right shape in the current world. </li> 
 </ul> 
 
 <p> Dependent type hypotheses are supported by <span class="v">sig</span> -- e.g. the 
 polymorphic signature of <span class="tt">nth</span> is specified as follows.  </p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(sig nth (nat (listof :a)) =&gt; :a
     :satisfies (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x1 (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> x2)))</pre> 
 
 <h5>Other Theory Reasoning</h5> 
 
 <p>Theory support for Records (structs) and Maps has been tuned to be more 
 robust. Destructor Elimination is now available for records.</p> 
 
 <h5>Advanced Usage</h5> 
 <p> 
 <span class="v">Defdata</span> has been re-engineered to have a plug-in like 
 architecture. The following macros provide ways to extend the Defdata 
 language and its semantics.</p>

 <dd> <span class="v">register-type</span> -- Register a name as a defdata type (with its associated metadata).</dd> 
 <dd> <span class="v">register-data-constructor</span> -- Register a data constructor (for product types).</dd> 
 <dd> <span class="v">register-user-combinator</span> -- Add user-defined syntactic sugar to the defdata language. 
 e.g. <i>alistof</i> was added with minimal coding overhead using this facility (See defdata/alistof.lisp).</dd> 
 <dd> <span class="v">defdata-attach</span> -- Replaces/subsumes) defdata-testing; it can be used to change or add defdata type metadata. </dd> 
 </dl> 
 
 
 <h3>Defsort</h3> 
 
 <p>The interface to <a href="ACL2____DEFSORT.html">defsort</a> has been extended, and it can now reuse 
 existing list recognizers.</p> 
 
 <p>Defsort can now (optionally) prove that the new sorting function is 
 equivalent to an insertion sort.</p> 
 
 <p>Defsort now allows extra arguments, e.g., to parameterize the sort.</p> 
 
 
 
 <h3>Tools</h3> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-RAW.html">include-raw</a> utility has been made more robust.  It now checks the 
 write-date of compiled files, to avoid including stale files.</p> 
 
 <p>The utilities <a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ACL2.html">profile-ACL2</a> and <a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ALL.html">profile-all</a> now work in the 
 ACL2 loop, and are documented.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">watch</span> utility works again.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for providing 
 fixes.  To use this utility:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/memoize/old/watch" :dir :system :ttags :all)
:q
(<a href="ACL2____WATCH.html">watch</a>)
(<a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a>)
; Now in Emacs, bring into a buffer the file reported by (<a href="ACL2____WATCH.html">watch</a>), whose
; name is of the form watch-output-temp-n.lsp.  Then execute ACL2 forms.</pre> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____UNTRANSLATE-PATTERNS.html">untranslate-patterns</a> tool is now compatible with <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a>'s 
 <a href="ACL2____UNTRANSLATE-PREPROCESS.html">untranslate-preprocess</a> hook.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>OSLIB</h3> 
 
 <p>OSLIB has been reorganized to try to make it somewhat more coherent.  Most 
 files in oslib are now split up into, e.g., argv-logic.lisp (no raw code or 
 ttags) and argv.lisp (actual implementation).</p> 
 
 <p>OSLIB has new functions including <a href="OSLIB____DIRNAME.html">oslib::dirname</a>, <a href="OSLIB____BASENAME.html">oslib::basename</a>, <a href="OSLIB____COPY.html">oslib::copy</a>, and <a href="OSLIB____CATPATHS.html">oslib::catpaths</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="OSLIB____LS.html">oslib::ls</a>, <a href="OSLIB____LS-FILES.html">oslib::ls-files</a>, and <a href="OSLIB____LS-SUBDIRS.html">oslib::ls-subdirs</a> 
 functions have been improved to return better error information, and made more 
 portable across Lisps.</p> 
 
 <h3>Tau</h3> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">tau/bounders/elementary-bounders</span> has been improved by adding 
 guards, thanks to Dmitry Nadezhin.</p> 
 
 <h2>Changes to Centaur Libraries</h2> 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____BITOPS.html">bitops</a></h3> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2PART-INSTALL.html">bitops::bitops/part-install</a> macro can be used to set particular bits of an 
 integer to a value.  It is somewhat similar to utilities like <a href="ACL2____WRB.html">wrb</a> from 
 the IHS library, but its interface is perhaps more intuitive.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2FAST-ROTATE.html">bitops::bitops/fast-rotate</a> macros provide optimized versions of <a href="ACL2____ROTATE-LEFT.html">rotate-left</a> and <a href="ACL2____ROTATE-RIGHT.html">rotate-right</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2LOGBITP-BOUNDS.html">bitops::bitops/logbitp-bounds</a> book provides a few lemmas relating 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> to <a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a>.</p> 
 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a></h3> 
 
 <p>The <a href="STD____DEFLIST.html">std::deflist</a> and <a href="FTY____DEFLIST.html">fty::deflist</a> books are now integrated, so 
 that <span class="v">fty::deflist</span> can provide the ordinary <span class="v">std::deflist</span> theorems. 
 The <span class="v">fty::deflist</span> and <span class="v">fty::defalist</span> macros now provide at least <a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> theorems by default.</p> 
 
 <p>The documentation-generating macros have been enhanced.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="FTY____DEFTYPES.html">fty::deftypes</a> macro now uses more aggressive theory management to 
 speed up certification, and also has more comprehensive error checking.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="FTY____DEFFIXTYPE.html">fty::deffixtype</a> macro has better error checking.</p> 
 
 <p>The cases macros introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTYPES.html">fty::deftypes</a> now support an 
 <span class="v">:otherwise</span> case.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="FTY____DEFTYPES.html">fty::deftypes</a> <span class="v">make-</span> macros now disallow duplicated 
 keywords.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="FTY____DEFLIST.html">fty::deflist</a> and <a href="FTY____DEFALIST.html">fty::defalist</a> macros can now tolerate 
 already-defined predicates.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="FTY____BASETYPES.html">fty::basetypes</a> book has been filled out a bit, e.g., it now includes 
 <a href="ACL2____MAYBE-NATP.html">maybe-natp</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, <a href="FTY____DEFFIXTYPE.html">fty::deffixtype</a> now verifies the guards on the equivalence 
 relations it introduces.</p> 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">Quicklisp</a></h3> 
 
 <p>Quicklisp can now read proxy information from the <span class="v">HTTP_PROXY_WITH_PORT</span> 
 environment variable.  See also the "Using a proxy" page in <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION.html">books-certification</a>.  BOZO move that into Quicklisp?  Blah, all this stuff 
 always ends up duplicated everywhere.</p> 
 
 <p>Quicklisp now includes books for loading the <span class="v">uiop</span> library and a more 
 sensible <span class="v">cl-fad</span> book.  These libraries may be useful for doing file system 
 things.  The CCL-only restrictions on <span class="v">bordeaux-threads</span> and 
 <span class="v">hunchentoot</span> have been dropped since these libraries seem to be working 
 fine on modern SBCL distributions.  A book for the <span class="v">html-template</span> library 
 has also been added.</p> 
 
 <p>The Quicklisp build should be more robust.  It now checks for existing 
 Quicklisp installations and produce a sensible error message instead of dying 
 horribly.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Other</h3> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____GETOPT.html">getopt</a> library now has a basic test suite.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">centaur/misc/sharedlibs</span> code for relocating shared libraries has 
 been extended with a test/demo script.  The sharedlibs functions no longer 
 cause errors when used on non-CCL Lisps (they simply print a message, 
 instead.)</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____TEMPLATE-SUBST.html">template-subst</a> tool has been expanded with some additional 
 functions.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ALL.html">profile-all</a> and <a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ACL2.html">profile-ACL2</a> functions can now be used 
 from within the ACL2 loop instead of only from raw Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="FLAG____DEF-DOUBLEVAR-INDUCTION.html">flag::def-doublevar-induction</a> macro has been extended and improved.</p> 
 
 <p>For <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>, there is a new tool for <a href="ACL2____STV.html">stv</a> decomposition theorems, 
 <span class="v">oracle/stv-decomp-theory-expander.lisp</span>, and a demo of using this tool in 
 <span class="v">centaur/regression/composed-stv.lisp</span>.  The documentation tables for STVs 
 should now look nicer in the printer-friendly xdoc view.</p> 
 
 <p>In the <a href="ACL2____4V.html">4v</a> library, there are a few new <a href="ACL2_____A2SEXPR-REWRITES_A2.html">*sexpr-rewrites*</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Minor bug-fix to avoid complaint in an <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> <span class="v">bind-free</span> 
 routine.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <a href="SATLINK____GATHER-BENCHMARKS.html">satlink::gather-benchmarks</a>, a plugin for collecting DIMACS 
 files that SATLINK sends to the SAT solver. You could use this to gather 
 benchmarks for evaluating SAT solvers or for the SAT solving competitions.</p> 
 
 <p>In <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a>, fixed a bug in <span class="v">trace-gl-interp</span>.</p> 
 
 
 
 <h3>VL Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>VL has undergone significant extensions and changes, mostly toward extending 
 VL to support a subset of SystemVerilog.  VL is intended to also still support 
 Verilog-2005, and in many cases its Verilog-2005 support has been improved as 
 new SystemVerilog features have been implemented.  Some highlights:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>VL now has a more extensive "systest" suite for checking its work against 
 NCVerilog and VCS, and a preliminary "failtest" suite for ensuring that 
 certain modules with bad constructs are properly rejected.</li> 
 
 <li>Added parsing support for many constructs such as interfaces, packages, 
 generate statements, structs, unpacked arrays, etc.  The parser functions now 
 pass around a "parse state" object and generates warnings in a more coherent 
 way.  This results in certain speedups to its certification and allows for 
 distinguishing the names of data types from other identifiers, which is 
 necessary for parsing certain constructs.</li> 
 
 <li>More comprehensive parameter support.  This involved reworking 
 unparameterization to handle SystemVerilog data types, and adding support for 
 richer expressions in wire ranges, etc., by reworking how constant expressions 
 are evaluated to handle many more operators and operands of mixed sizes/types. 
 Generate statements are also now supported to some degree.</li> 
 
 <li>Added support for fancier ports, e.g., ports with data types, module 
 instances with <span class="v">.name</span> and <span class="v">.*</span> style connections, and interface 
 ports.</li> 
 
 <li>Added support for combinational user-defined primitives, and at least basic 
 parsing support for sequential UDPs.</li> 
 
 <li>Added some support for SystemVerilog packages and imports.  A new 
 "scopestack" abstraction is now widely used to provide more comprehensive 
 handling of nested scopes (e.g., named begin/end blocks), packages, etc.  There 
 is now some support for functions defined at the global scope.</li> 
 
 <li>Sizing has been extended to handle unpacked arrays.  The sizing code has 
 been reorganized to be more modular, and extended to handle additional 
 operators.</li> 
 
 <li>Miscellaneous improvements.  The pretty-printer has been extended to handle 
 the new SystemVerilog constructs, ansi-style ports, etc.  Some transforms are 
 more configurable, e.g., gate elimination can easily use alternate replacements 
 for gate instances.  There is better support for <span class="v">case</span> statements, 
 especially in <span class="v">always_comb</span> blocks.  Various operators are now supported to 
 various degrees, e.g., <span class="v">++</span>, casting operators, <span class="v">$bits</span>, streaming 
 concatenations.  The preprocessor now supports <span class="v">`define</span> macros with 
 arguments.  The hierarchy tools have been greatly simplified.</li> 
 
 <li>Numerous organizational changes, bug fixes, and updates to existing tools 
 and transforms to keep things working.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Besides these improvements to the core library, there have been various 
 user interface improvements.  For instance, the <a href="VL____VL-SERVER.html">vl::vl-server</a> has been 
 entirely rewritten and is now included in the <a href="VL____KIT.html">vl::kit</a>; it allows you to 
 view Verilog modules in a web browser.  The loader has been made more 
 user-friendly and more gracefully handles search paths, errors, etc.  The 
 <a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl::vl-lint</a>er has been tweaked to provide better output and to run more 
 quickly.</p>
