<p>Re-defining undone <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>s</p><p>Suppose <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "pkg" imports)</span> is the most recently executed 
 successful definition of <span class="v">"pkg"</span> in this ACL2 session and that it has 
 since been undone, as by <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span>.  Any future attempt in this 
 session to define <span class="v">"pkg"</span> as a package must specify an identical imports 
 list.</p> 
 
 <p>The restriction stems from the need to implement the reinstallation of 
 saved logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s as in error recovery and the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OOPS.html">oops</a></span> 
 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>.  Suppose that the new <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> attempts to import some 
 symbol, <span class="v">a::sym</span>, not imported by the previous definition of <span class="v">"pkg"</span>. 
 Because it was not imported in the original package, the symbol <span class="v">pkg::sym</span>, 
 different from <span class="v">a::sym</span>, may well have been created and may well be used in 
 some saved <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s.  Those saved <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s are Common Lisp objects 
 being held for you ``behind the scenes.''  In order to import <span class="v">a::sym</span> into 
 <span class="v">"pkg"</span> now we would have to unintern <span class="v">pkg::sym</span>, rendering those 
 saved <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s ill-formed.  It is because of saved <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s that we 
 do not actually clear out a package when it is undone.</p> 
 
 <p>At one point we thought it was sound to allow the new <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> to 
 import a subset of the old.  But that is incorrect.  Suppose the old 
 definition of <span class="v">"pkg"</span> imported <span class="v">a::sym</span> but the new one does not. 
 Suppose we allowed that and implemented it simply by setting the imports of 
 <span class="v">"pkg"</span> to the new subset.  Then consider the conjecture <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a> a::sym
 pkg::sym)</span>.  This ought not be a theorem because we did not import 
 <span class="v">a::sym</span> into <span class="v">"pkg"</span>.  But in fact in AKCL it is a theorem because 
 <span class="v">pkg::sym</span> is read as <span class="v">a::sym</span> because of the old imports.</p>
