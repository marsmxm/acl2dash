<p>Fixtype of statement types.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>return-types — <a href="C____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>variables — <a href="C____VAR-TABLE.html">var-table</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><h5>Additional Requirements</h5><p>The following invariant is enforced on the fields:</p><pre class="code">(not (empty return-types))</pre><p>Here we use the word ``type'' in a broad sense, 
     namely to describe the information inferred by the static semantics 
     about a statement (or block item or block). 
     The information consists of:</p><ul>
<li>A non-empty set of types that describes 
      the possible values returned by the statement. 
      These are determined by the <span class="v">return</span> statements; 
      in the presence of conditionals, 
      the possible types in the two branches are merged (i.e. unioned). 
      The type <span class="v">void</span> is used to describe statements 
      that do not return a value, 
      but instead transfer control to the next statement (if any).</li>
<li>A possibly updated variable table. 
      This is updated by block items that are declarations. 
      We actually only need to return possibly updated variable tables 
      from the ACL2 function <span class="tt"><a href="C____CHECK-BLOCK-ITEM.html">check-block-item</a></span>; 
      the ACL2 functions <span class="tt"><a href="C____CHECK-STMT.html">check-stmt</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="C____CHECK-BLOCK-ITEM-LIST.html">check-block-item-list</a></span> 
      could just return a set of optional types (see above). 
      However, for uniformity we have all three functions 
      return also a possibly updated variable table.</li>
</ul>
