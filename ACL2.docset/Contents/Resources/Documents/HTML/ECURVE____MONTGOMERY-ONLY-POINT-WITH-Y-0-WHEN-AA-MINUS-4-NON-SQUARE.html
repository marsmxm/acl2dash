<p>Theorem about the only point with zero ordinate 
          for certain Montgomery curves.</p><p>If A^2 - 4 is not a square, 
     then (0,0) is the only point on a Montgomery curve 
     with y = 0. 
     The proof is carried out via a series of lemmas 
     that explain it. 
     It requires some algebraic manipulations that are not simplifications; 
     thus, it would be interesting to see whether and how it is possible 
     to carry out the proofs more automatically 
     via sufficiently general rules.</p><p>This theorem has some significance, in particular, for the <a href="ECURVE____BIRATIONAL-MONTGOMERY-TWISTED-EDWARDS.html">birational equivalence between 
                     Montgomery and twisted Edwards curves</a>: points with y = 0 on a Montgomery curve 
     are not amenable to the rational mapping, 
     because they make a denominator zero; 
     thus, they have to be treated specially for the mapping. 
     This theorem, under the aforementioned condition on A, 
     tells us that there is just one such point.</p>
