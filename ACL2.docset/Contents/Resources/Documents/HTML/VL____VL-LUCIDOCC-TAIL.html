<p>An occurrence of an identifier with something fancy.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-LUCIDOCC.html">vl-lucidocc</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>ctx  <a href="VL____VL-LUCIDCTX.html">vl-lucidctx</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The general context where the usage occurred.  Knowing where the 
            occurrence came from is useful when we need to report about 
            multiply driven signals.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>We use this to record occurrences of a variable where there is 
additional indexing or some kind of struct field referencing.  For instance, if 
we have a variable, <span class="v">myinst</span>, which is an <span class="v">instruction_t</span> structure, then 
we might have reads or writes of individual fields, like <span class="v">myinst.opcode</span> or 
<span class="v">myinst.arg1</span>.  We don't currently record what the tail is or analyze it in 
any sensible way, but this at least allows us to see that something has been 
read/written.</p>
