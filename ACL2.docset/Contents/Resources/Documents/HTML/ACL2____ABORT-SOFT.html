<p>Control how interrupts are handled in proofs</p><p>ACL2 arranges by default that when a proof is interrupted (with 
 <span class="v">Control-C</span>), a ``soft'' abort occurs in the following sense: the message 
 below is printed and then the proof attempt continues temporarily before 
 ultimately failing (usually very soon thereafter).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">***********************************************
Note:  interrupt signal
  Will attempt to exit the proof in progress;
  otherwise, the next interrupt will abort the proof.
  For an immediate abort see :DOC abort-soft.
***********************************************</pre> 
 
 <p>This default behavior supports proper operation of the utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REDO-FLAT.html">redo-flat</a></span>, when a proof is interrupted.  It also supports more complete 
 summaries than would be obtained with an immediate abort.  If you nevertheless 
 want proofs to abort immediately, you may evaluate the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a>
 abort-soft nil)</span>.  To restore the default behavior, evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a>
 abort-soft t)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Remarks for system hackers.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>An important effect of having evaluated <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> abort-soft nil)</span> is 
 that an interrupt will send you immediately back to the ACL2 read-eval-print 
 loop, in contrast to the default behavior where the prover returns an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a> whose error component is non-<span class="v">nil</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>It may be preferable to bind <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global <span class="v">abort-soft</span> rather 
 than to assign it globally.  See the implementation of <a href="ACL2____PROVE_42.html">prove$</a> (specifically, the definition of <span class="v">prove$-fn</span> in <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a> <span class="v">books/tools/prove-dollar.lisp</span>) for an example.</li>
