<p>A model of C pointers for ATC.</p><p>For now we use a simple model of pointers, 
     which suffices for our current purposes. 
     A pointer in our model is either null or an address, 
     where an address is an essentially opaque entity 
     whose sole purpose is to identify an object (in the C sense) 
     allocated in some (externally populated) memory.</p>
