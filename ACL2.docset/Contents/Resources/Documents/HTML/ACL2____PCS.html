<p>Print the sequence of <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s between two <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptors</p><pre class="code">Examples:
:pcs 1 5              ; print commands 1 through 5
:pcs 5 1              ; same as above
:pcs :x (:x -3)       ; print the 3 most recently executed commands
:pcs fn assoc-of-fn   ; print the commands between the one that introduced
                      ; fn and the one that introduced assoc-of-fn</pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Pcs</span> takes two arguments, both of which are <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptors, 
 and prints the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s between them with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a></span>.  The order of the 
 two descriptors is irrelevant.  See <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a> for a 
 description of <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptors.  See <a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a> for a description of 
 the format in which <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s are displayed.</p> 
 
 <p>For a related utility that simply returns a sequence of commands, see <a href="ACL2____GET-COMMAND-SEQUENCE.html">get-command-sequence</a>.</p>
