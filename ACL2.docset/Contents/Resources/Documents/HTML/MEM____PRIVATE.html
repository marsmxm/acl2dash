<p>Redundantly define, then serverely restrict the usage of some function.</p><p>Example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="MEM____PRIVATE.html">private</a> foo (x y)
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> x)
       ...))</pre> 
 
<p><span class="v">private</span> is a macro which may be useful for authors of libraries, or to 
users who want to enforce severe discipline upon themselves.</p> 
 
<p>The macro is similar to <a href="ACL2____DEFUND.html">defund</a> in that it first introduces a defun 
and then immediately disables its definition.  However, <span class="v">private</span> goes 
further: it also disables the resulting type-prescription rule and sets up 
<a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a>s that prohibit the user from ever enabling the 
definition or the type prescription.</p> 
 
<p>Why would we want such a thing?  A nice way to develop libraries is to use 
<a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">ACL2::redundant-events</a> in an interface file, so that users never even 
see the local lemmas and so forth that you used to get the proofs to go 
through.  This gives you the freedom to change and remove those definitions at 
will.</p> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot do the same for functions, because ACL2 needs the 
functions available in the interface book if they are ever used.  With 
<span class="v">private</span>, you can identify functions that you want to keep control over and 
that the user should either (1) not be using at all, or (2) only be reasoning 
about using the theorems your have provided.</p> 
 
<p>To use private, simply copy your <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo ...)</span> form into your 
interface file, then replace <span class="v">defun</span> with <span class="v">private</span>.</p>
