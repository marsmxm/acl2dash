<p>Eliminate unused parameters from modules.</p><p>Parameter-cleaning is an optional transformation which is intended 
to reduce the number of modules introduced by unparameterization.</p> 
 
<p>We find that many frequently-instantiated, low-level modules often have 
parameters that are not actually used in the RTL model.  For instance, a module 
might have a size or delay parameter that does not affect its RTL-level 
semantics.</p> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, every time the module is instantiated with, say, a different 
delay, <a href="VL2014____UNPARAMETERIZATION.html">unparameterization</a> will produce a new instance of it that is 
specialized for that particular delay.  This can lead us to make a lot of 
copies of identical modules, with different names.  And, each of these modules 
then has to go through the rest of the transformation process, which can be 
slow.</p> 
 
<p>So, our idea in this transformation is to cut out irrelevant parameters 
before unparameterization is invoked.</p>
