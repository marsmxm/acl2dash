<p>ACL2-2018 Workshop paper on AIJ and ATJ.</p><p>The <a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/paper.cgi?ACL22018.1" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2-2018 Workshop paper on AIJ and ATJ<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/paper.cgi?ACL22018.1"></nobr></a> provides an overview of AIJ and ATJ, 
     along with some performance measurements. 
     The presentation of the Workshop talk is available <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/program.html" target="_blank"><nobr>here<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2018/program.html"></nobr></a>.</p><p>As AIJ and ATJ are being extended and improved over time, 
     some of the contents of the paper and presentation are becoming outdated. 
     This manual provides up-to-date information about AIJ and ATJ. 
     The following differences exist 
     between the current version of AIJ and ATJ 
     and the version described in the paper and presentation:</p><ul>
<li>The Java class <span class="v">Acl2Constant</span> 
      has been renamed to <span class="v">Acl2QuotedConstant</span>.</li>
<li>The Java class <span class="v">Acl2Cons</span> 
      has been renamed to <span class="v">Acl2ConsPair</span>.</li>
<li>The Java class <span class="v">Acl2FunctionApplication</span> 
      has been renamed to <span class="v">Acl2FunctionCall</span>.</li>
<li>AIJ's evaluator has been extended 
      to recognize a ``pseudo-function'' <span class="v">or</span> 
      and to execute it non-strictly, 
      as an optimized version of an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> 
      whose test and `then' branch are the same. 
      Accordingly, ATJ has been extended 
      to recognize translated terms of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> a a b)</span> 
      and to generate Java code to represent them as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> a b)</span>.</li>
<li>The Java representation of ACL2 variables 
      has been optimized to include numeric indices 
      derived from the position of variables 
      in the lists of parameters 
      in named function definitions and lambda expressions. 
      These indices are set in the body of each function definition 
      as the function definition is added to 
      the Java representation of the ACL2 environment. 
      The AIJ evaluator has been optimized to use 
      Java arrays of ACL2 values as bindings, 
      instead of hash maps from ACL2 symbols to values, 
      enabling faster lookup of variables in bindings.</li>
<li>The Java representation of ACL2 named functions 
      has been changed to consist of native and defined functions. 
      The former have a native Java implementation, 
      while the latter have a definition 
      in the Java representation of the ACL2 environment. 
      All the ACL2 primitive functions are represented as native functions, 
      the ``pseudo-function'' <span class="v">or</span> is represented like that as well, 
      and other built-in ACL2 functions could be represented like that as well 
      in the future. 
      Each native function has its own unique Java class and instance: 
      its application to values is now handled via Java's dynamic dispatch 
      rather than by cases analysis, thus optimizing evaluation. 
      Each defined function has its own unique instance as well 
      (so, all the ACL2 named functions are interned), 
      and its representation includes its definition, 
      so that evaluation no longer needs to 
      look up the function definition in the environment, 
      resulting in increased execution speed.</li>
<li>The Java class <span class="v">Acl2Environment</span> has been eliminated. 
      The information about the function definitions 
      is now stored directly with the function themselves. 
      The information about the package definitions 
      is now stored directly into instances of a Java class <span class="v">Acl2Package</span> 
      that has been added for this purpose; 
      this class also contains the information about the package witness name.</li>
<li>The package witness name, 
      i.e. the content of the <span class="v">*pkg-witness-name*</span> constant, 
      is now stored in a final static field, 
      which therefore no longer needs to be initialized 
      by code external to AIJ. 
      The consistency of this Java value with the actual ACL2 value 
      is checked via an assertion in a newly added file 
      <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/java/aij/assumptions.lisp</span>.</li>
<li>The return types of some of the native Java implementation methods 
      of the ACL2 primitive functions in AIJ 
      have been made more precise than the general type <span class="v">Acl2Value</span>, 
      e.g. now the method for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> returns <span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span>.</li>
<li>Some native Java implementations of ACL2 primitive functions 
      have been optimized.</li>
<li>Public static methods have been added 
      to execute the native implementations of ACL2 functions 
      from outside AIJ. 
      This is in support of the shallow embedding approach (see below).</li>
<li>Some variant native implementations of ACL2 functions 
      have been added that assume the satisfaction of the guards. 
      This is in support of the shallow embedding approach (see below) 
      when assuming that the guards are satisfied (see below).</li>
<li>AIJ has been extended with the ability to validate statically that 
      all the function calls reference existing functions 
      and have a number of arguments that matches the function arity. 
      AIJ provides a new public API method 
      to validate all the currently defined functions. 
      AIJ can thus avoid these checks at run time, 
      resulting in increased execution speed.</li>
<li>ATJ has been extended with a facility to generate Java code 
      to execute tests that compare 
      results obtained via evaluation in ACL2 
      with results obtained via evaluation in AIJ.</li>
<li>ATJ has been extended with a facility to generate Java code 
      according to a shallow embedding approach, 
      in addition to the deep embedding approach described in the paper.</li>
<li>ATJ has been extended with a facility to generate Java code 
      assuming that all the guards are satisfied. 
      This facility is available for 
      both the deep and shallow embedding approaches.</li>
</ul><p>The last two bullet points above provide a major extension of ATJ, 
     which produces much more readable and efficient Java code, 
     including Java code that manipulates Java primitive types and arrays.</p>
