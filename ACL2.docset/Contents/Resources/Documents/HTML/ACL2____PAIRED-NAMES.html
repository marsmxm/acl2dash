<p>Utilities for paired names.</p><p> 
   A <i>paired name</i> is a symbol consisting of three parts, in this order: 
   </p> 
   <ol> 
     <li> 
     A non-empty sequence of characters that is the first name of the pair. 
     </li> 
     <li> 
     A non-empty sequence of characters 
     that separates the two names of the pair. 
     This character sequence is global but customizable. 
     </li> 
     <li> 
     A non-empty sequence of characters that is the second name of the pair. 
     </li> 
   </ol> 
   <p> 
   Examples of paired names are: 
   </p> 
   <ul> 
     <li> 
     <span class="v">F-~&gt;-G</span>, where 
     <span class="v">F</span> is the first name, 
     <span class="v">-~&gt;</span> is the separator, and 
     <span class="v">G</span> is the second name. 
     </li> 
     <li> 
     <span class="v">LOGIC-SORT-IS-EXEC-SORT</span>, where 
     <span class="v">LOGIC-SORT</span> is the first name, 
     <span class="v">-IS-</span> is the separator, and 
     <span class="v">EXEC-SORT</span> is the second name. 
     </li> 
   </ul> 
   <p> 
   Note that if the separator occurs in the first or second name, 
   the paired name cannot be uniquely decomposed 
   into its three constituents. 
   For instance, if the separator is <span class="v">&lt;-&gt;</span>, 
   there are two different ways to decompose 
   <span class="v">ABC&lt;-&gt;DEF&lt;-&gt;GHI</span>. 
   </p> 
   <p> 
   Paired names are useful, for instance, 
   to denote theorems that state certain kinds of relations 
   between functions (denoted by the first and second names of the pairs), 
   where the separator describes the relation, 
   e.g. <span class="v">F-~&gt;-G</span> could denote a theorem stating that 
   the function <span class="v">F</span> is transformed into an equivalent function <span class="v">G</span>.
