<p>Fixtype of variable tables.</p><p>These are symbol tables for variables. 
     For now a table is just a set of variable names (identifiers), 
     because there is no type information associated to variables 
     (cf. abstract syntax), 
     but we may extend this to an omap from variables to types in the future. 
     Currently this fixtype is equivalent to <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____IDENTIFIER-SET.html">identifier-set</a></span>, 
     but we make it a separate fixtype to facilitate 
     the aforementioned extension in the future.</p><p>A variable table as defined here consists of the variables that are 
     not only visible, but also accessible, 
     according to [Yul: Specification of Yul: Scoping Rules]: 
     a variable is visible in the rest of the block in which it is declared, 
     including sub-blocks, 
     but it is not accessible in 
     function definitions in the block or sub-blocks. 
     Variables that are visible but inaccessible 
     are not represented in the variable tables defined here.</p>
