<p>Special notes about using <span class="v">cert.pl</span> on Windows.</p><p>There are two main ways you can run <span class="v">cert.pl</span> (and for that 
matter ACL2) on Windows.</p> 
 
<h3>Option 1: Virtual Machine</h3> 
 
<p>A good way to run ACL2 on Windows may be to install an operating system like 
Linux inside of virtual machine.  Some options are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank"><nobr>VirtualBox<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.virtualbox.org/"></nobr></a> (free)</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/player/" target="_blank"><nobr>VMWare Player<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.vmware.com/products/player/"></nobr></a> (free 
for personal use)</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/" target="_blank"><nobr>VMWare 
Workstation<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation/"></nobr></a> (commercial)</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Using a virtual machine certainly has its downsides.  You're committing to a 
certain amount of configuration, sacrificing some disk space and memory, and 
probably losing some performance.  Even so, you may find this option to be 
generally more reliable than using Unix tools like <span class="v">make</span> and Lisp runtimes 
on a Windows system.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Option 2: Native Windows</h3> 
 
<p>If you prefer to avoid using a virtual machine, you may still be able to use 
<span class="v">cert.pl</span> on Windows.  Unlike other operating systems, Windows does not 
include a typical Unix environment with commands like <span class="v">ls</span>, <span class="v">rm</span>, 
<span class="v">grep</span>, etc, so using ACL2 on Windows typically means installing a Unix 
emulation layer such as <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/" target="_blank"><nobr>cygwin<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cygwin.com/"></nobr></a> or <a href="http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS" target="_blank"><nobr>msys<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
<p>We do not know which to recommend because we have experienced problems on 
both!  With msys, we have seen <span class="v">make</span> hang when we try parallel builds. 
With cygwin, we have sometimes seen "random" CCL crashes.  From time to time, 
we have successfully used <span class="v">cert.pl</span> on msys with a single-threaded 
build.</p> 
 
<p>Both cygwin and msys have their own Perl packages available.  For 
<span class="v">cert.pl</span> to work, please make sure you are using the Cygwin or Msys version 
of Perl.  Native Windows versions of Perl, such as Strawberry Perl, are <b>not 
known to work</b>.</p> 
 
<p>We intend for <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to work on Windows.  If you experience any 
problems that you believe are due to <span class="v">cert.pl</span> itself, rather than with 
<span class="v">make</span> or with your Lisp, then we would appreciate your help with 
beta-testing and with making it more robust.</p>
