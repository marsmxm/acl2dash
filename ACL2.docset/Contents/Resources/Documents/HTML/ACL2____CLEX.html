<p><b>C</b>entaur <b>Lex</b>er Library.</p><p>This is a rudimentary library for creating lexers for character 
data in ACL2.  It is an outgrowth and revision of lexer support routines that 
were originally developed as part of the <a href="ACL2____VL.html">ACL2::vl</a> library.</p> 
 
<p>These routines are based on ACL2 <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">ACL2::characters</a>.  They are, 
accordingly, suitable for processing text in ASCII or ISO-8859-1 or some other 
8-bit character set, but <b>not Unicode</b> or other wide character sets.  It 
would generally be a bad idea to use CLEX to write a lexer for a language like 
Java or XML that needs Unicode support.</p> 
 
<p>Many lexical analyzers like <a href="http://flex.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"><nobr>Flex<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://flex.sourceforge.net/"></nobr></a> 
are rather sophisticated and allow you to declare the syntax of your tokens at 
a relatively high level (e.g., via regular expressions); this description is 
then compiled into a full-blown scanner function.</p> 
 
<p>In comparison, CLEX is quite primitive.  Really, it is nothing more than 
some functions that tend to be useful when writing lexers "by hand." Even so, 
this is not so bad.  Here are the things that CLEX provides:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>A <a href="CLEX____SIN.html">stream input</a> mechanism that is somewhat 
efficient and conveniently tracks your position (for good error messages).</li> 
 
<li>A <a href="STR____DEFCHARSET.html">defcharset</a> macro for describing basic character types (e.g., 
whitespace, digits, letters, etc).</li> 
 
<li>Basic <a href="CLEX____MATCHING-FUNCTIONS.html">matching-functions</a> for tokenizing input.</li> 
 
<li>Macros like <a href="CLEX____DEF-SIN-PROGRESS.html">def-sin-progress</a> for proving that your lexers make 
progress.</li> 
 
<li>Lemmas about matching functions for proving basic "reconstruction" 
theorems.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h3>Getting Started</h3> 
 
<p>Most users should simply load the top book in the library as follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/clex/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>Besides this documentation, you may find it useful to see the <a href="CLEX____EXAMPLE-LEXER.html">example-lexer</a>, located in <span class="v">centaur/clex/example.lisp</span>; note that this 
example is not included in <span class="v">clex/top</span>.</p>
