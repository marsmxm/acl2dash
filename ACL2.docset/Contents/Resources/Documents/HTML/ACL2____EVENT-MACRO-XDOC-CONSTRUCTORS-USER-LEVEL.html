<p>Utilities to construct <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">XDOC</a> strings 
          to document <a href="ACL2____EVENT-MACROS.html">event macros</a> 
          at the user level.</p><p>The <span class="v">xdoc::evmac-section-...</span> utilities construct level-3 sections. 
     Some are relatively thin wrappers, 
     which precede their arguments 
     (which must be zero or more pieces of XDOC text) 
     with specific level-3 headings. 
     Other utilities provide more automation.</p><p>The <span class="v">xdoc::evmac-input-...</span> utilities construct 
     <a href="XDOC____DESC.html">descriptions</a> 
     of inputs that are expected to be common to multiple event macros. 
     Each such utility includes zero or more parameters 
     to customize the description, 
     as well as zero or more additional pieces of XDOC text (e.g. paragraphs) 
     that are appended after the automatically generated XDOC text.</p>
