<p>Computing advice to the theorem proving process</p><pre class="code">General Form of :hints:
(hint1 hint2 ... hintk)</pre> 
 
 <p>Each element, hinti, must be either a common hint or a computed hint.</p> 
 
 <p>A common hint is of the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a> :key1 val1 ... :keyn valn)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">goal-spec</span> is as specified in <a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a> and each 
 <span class="v">:keyi</span> and <span class="v">vali</span> is as specified in <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  Among the ``common 
 hints'' we include both the primitive hints and user-defined custom keyword 
 hints (see <a href="ACL2____CUSTOM-KEYWORD-HINTS.html">custom-keyword-hints</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>A computed hint may be a function symbol, <span class="v">fn</span>, of three, four or seven 
 arguments.  Otherwise, a computed hint is a term with the following 
 properties:</p> 
 
 <p>(a) the only free variables allowed in the term are <span class="v">ID</span>, <span class="v">CLAUSE</span>, 
 <span class="v">WORLD</span>, <span class="v">STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP</span>, <span class="v">HIST</span>, <span class="v">PSPV</span>, <span class="v">CTX</span>, 
 and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>;</p> 
 
 <p>(b) the output signature of the term is either <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">MV</a> * * STATE)</span>, which 
 is to be treated as an error triple (see below), or is <span class="v">*</span>, denoting a 
 single non-<a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> value; and</p> 
 
 <p>(c) in the former case of (b) above, the term is single-threaded in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If a computed hint is a function symbol <span class="v">fn</span>, whose arity n is therefore 
 three, four, or seven, then it is treated as the term resulting from applying 
 that <span class="v">fn</span> to the first n variables shown in (a) above.  Notice that it must 
 then return a single non-<a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> value, not an error triple, since 
 <span class="v">state</span> is not one of the first seven variables shown in (a).</p> 
 
 <p>Note: Error triples are an ACL2 idiom for implementing ``errors''; see 
 <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>.  If a computation returns <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val state)</span> in a 
 context in which ACL2 is respecting the error triple convention (see <a href="ACL2____LD-ERROR-TRIPLES.html">ld-error-triples</a> and see <a href="ACL2____LD-ERROR-ACTION.html">ld-error-action</a>), then an error is deemed to 
 have occurred if <span class="v">erp</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  The computation is expected to 
 have printed an appropriate error message to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> and further 
 computation is aborted.  On the other hand, if a computation returns an error 
 triple in which <span class="v">erp</span> is nil, then ``value'' of the computation is taken to 
 be the second component, <span class="v">val</span>, of the triple (along with the possibly 
 modified <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>), and computation continues.  For more information 
 about programming with error triples, see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING-WITH-STATE.html">programming-with-state</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The function symbol cases are treated as abbreviations of the term <span class="v">(fn
 ID CLAUSE WORLD)</span>, <span class="v">(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP)</span>, or 
 <span class="v">(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP HIST PSPV CTX)</span> as 
 appropriate for the arity of <span class="v">fn</span>.  (Note that this tells you which 
 argument of <span class="v">fn</span> is which.)  Moreover, in these cases the value returned 
 must be a single ordinary (non-<a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>) value, not an error triple.  In 
 the discussion below we assume all computed hints are of the term form. 
 Indeed, we almost assume all computed hints are of the 3 and 4 argument forms. 
 We only comment briefly on the 7 argument form in <a href="ACL2____USING-COMPUTED-HINTS-8.html">using-computed-hints-8</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The semantics of a computed hint term is as follows.  On every subgoal, the 
 term is evaluated in an environment in which the variables mentioned in (a) 
 above are bound to context-sensitive values explained below.  Either the 
 computed hint signals an error, in which the proof attempt aborts, or else it 
 returns a value, <span class="v">val</span> and a new state, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.  Any changes to 
 those parts of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> that affect logical soundness are undone; more 
 specifically, the values of symbols (sometimes called ``state global 
 variables'') in the list <span class="v">*protected-system-state-globals*</span> in the global 
 table of the state (see <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>) are restored when changed during 
 evaluation.  The value, <span class="v">val</span>, of a non-erroneous computed hint calculation 
 is either <span class="v">nil</span>, which means the computed hint did not apply to the subgoal 
 in question, or it is an alternating list of <span class="v">:keyi vali</span> pairs as 
 specified in <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  With one exception, those new hints are applied to 
 the given subgoal as though the user had typed them explicitly.</p> 
 
 <p>The exception is that the first keyword in the returned <span class="v">val</span> is allowed 
 to be <span class="v">:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</span>.  Its value should be <span class="v">nil</span>, <span class="v">t</span>, 
 or a list of terms.  If this keyword is not present, the default value of 
 <span class="v">nil</span> is provided.  We explain <span class="v">:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</span> below.</p> 
 
 <p>The evaluation of a hint term is done with guard checking turned off (see 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>); e.g., the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 23)</span> in a computed hint 
 returns <span class="v">nil</span> as per the axioms.</p> 
 
 <p>When a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value is returned, the keyword/value pairs (other than 
 the optional <span class="v">:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</span>) are used as the hint for the 
 subgoal in question.  Thus, your job as the programmer of computed hints is 
 either to cause an error, typically by invoking <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a></span>, or to return a 
 non-erroneous value triple whose value is the list of keys and values you 
 would have typed had you supplied a common hint for the subgoal. (In 
 particular, any theory expressions in it are evaluated with respect to the 
 global current-theory, not whatever theory is active at the subgoal in 
 question.)  If the generated list of keywords and values is illegal, an error 
 will be signaled and the proof attempt will be aborted.</p> 
 
 <p>The purpose of the <span class="v">:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</span> keyword and its value, 
 <span class="v">chr</span>, is to change the list of hints.  If <span class="v">chr</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, then the 
 computed hint which was applied is removed from the list of hints that is 
 passed down to the children of the subgoal in question.  This is the default. 
 If <span class="v">chr</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, then the computed hint is left in the list of hints. 
 This means that the same computed hint may act on the children of the subgoal. 
 Otherwise, <span class="v">chr</span> must be a list of terms, each of which is treated as a 
 computed hint.  The computed hint which was applied is deleted from the list 
 of hints and the computed hints in <span class="v">chr</span> are added to the list of hints 
 passed to the children of the subgoal.  The ability to generate new computed 
 hints and pass them down allows strange and wonderful behavior.  Notice that 
 certain hints, for example <span class="v">:in-theory</span> and <span class="v">:expand</span> hints, which 
 appear in the computed hint will continue to take effect even when <span class="v">chr</span> is 
 <span class="v">nil</span>.  This might give one the false impression that a removed computed 
 hint still hangs around.  See <a href="ACL2____HINTS-AND-THE-WATERFALL.html">hints-and-the-waterfall</a> for a more 
 detailed discussion about how <span class="v">:in-theory</span> and other hints are handled in 
 the waterfall.</p> 
 
 <p>For these purposes, the goals produced by induction and the top-level goals 
 of forcing rounds are not considered children; all original hints are 
 available to them.</p> 
 
 <p>Only the first hint applicable to a goal, as specified in the user-supplied 
 list of <span class="v">:hints</span> followed by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-HINTS-TABLE.html">default-hints-table</a></span>, will be 
 applied to that goal.  (For an advanced exception, see <a href="ACL2____OVERRIDE-HINTS.html">override-hints</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p>It remains only to describe the bindings of the free variables.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose the theorem prover is working on some clause, clause, named by some 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a></span>, e.g., "Subgoal *1/2'''" in some logical world, world. 
 Corresponding to the printed <span class="v">goal-spec</span> is an internal data structure 
 called a ``clause identifier'' id.  See <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-IDENTIFIER.html">clause-identifier</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>In the case of a common hint, the hint applies if the goal-spec of the hint 
 is the same as the goal-spec of the clause in question.</p> 
 
 <p>In the case of a computed hint, the variable <span class="v">ID</span> is bound to the clause 
 id, the variable <span class="v">CLAUSE</span> is bound to the (translated form of the) clause, 
 and the variable <span class="v">WORLD</span> is bound to the current ACL2 world.  The variable 
 <span class="v">STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP</span> is bound to <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>.  It is bound 
 to <span class="v">t</span> only if the clause is known to be stable under simplification.  That 
 is, the simplifier has been applied to the clause and did not change it.  Such 
 a clause is sometimes known as a ``simplification checkpoint.''  It is 
 frequently useful to inject hints (e.g., to enable a rule or provide a 
 <span class="v">:use</span> hint) only when the goal in question has stabilized.  If a hint is 
 provided, the processing of the clause starts over with simplification.</p> 
 
 <p>As for <span class="v">CTX</span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>, they are provided so that you can pass 
 them to the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a></span> macro to print error messages.  We recommend not 
 writing computed hints that otherwise change <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>!</p> 
 
 <p>The remaining variables, <span class="v">HIST</span> and <span class="v">PSPV</span> are not documented yet. 
 Only users familiar with the internals of ACL2 are likely to need them or 
 understand their values.</p>
