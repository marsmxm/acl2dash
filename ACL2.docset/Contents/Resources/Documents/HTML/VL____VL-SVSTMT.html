<p>Discussion of creating svex assignments from combinational/latch-style 
          always blocks.</p><p>Verilog and SystemVerilog don't always cleanly translate to a 
finite-state-machine semantics, especially when it comes to always blocks that 
behave as latches.  We discuss some of the choices we made in this translation.</p> 
 
<h2>Difference between <span class="v">always_comb</span>, <span class="v">always_latch</span>, and plain <span class="v">always</span>
</h2> 
 
<p>It isn't clear how Verilog simulators distinguish between these constructs. 
For a simple latch of the form</p> 
<pre class="code">always_latch if (en) q = d;</pre> 
 
<p>Verilog simulators produce identical results if the <span class="v">always_latch</span> is 
replaced by any of <span class="v">always_comb</span>, <span class="v">always @*</span>, or <span class="v">always @(en or d)</span>. 
However, we treat it differently in the <span class="v">always_comb</span> case, 
because... (BOZO)</p>
