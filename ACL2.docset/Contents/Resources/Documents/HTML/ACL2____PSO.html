<p>Show the most recently saved output</p><p>Evaluate <span class="v">:pso</span> in order to print output that was generated in 
 an environment where output was being saved, as in <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a>, which is 
 active when ACL2 is invoked.  Also see <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Example Forms:

:pso                        ; Print saved output.

                            ; for '"Subgoal *1/2'5'" and ending just
                            ; before the output for "Subgoal *1/2'14'".

(<a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a> '("Subgoal *1/2'5'"  "Subgoal *1/2''")

General Form:

(<a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a> start-goals-spec ; optional: default is :ALL
     stop-goals-spec  ; optional: default is NIL
     )</pre> 
 
 <p>where both arguments are optional and have the defaults shown above.  Thus, 
 the keyword command <span class="v">:pso</span> is equivalent to each of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a>)</span>, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a> :all)</span>, and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a> :all nil)</span>; see <a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-COMMANDS.html">keyword-commands</a>.  The 
 optional arguments restrict the output to specified goals, as follows; but the 
 examples above probably provide an easier way to understand those arguments 
 than the following explanation.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">Start-goals-spec</span> represents <i>the set of start goal names</i>.  Its 
 effects are described below.  The value <span class="v">:all</span> represents the set of all 
 goal names, a string represents the set consisting of just that one goal name, 
 and a list represents the set of all goal names in that list.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">Stop-goals-spec</span> represents <i>the set of stop goal names</i>.  Its 
 effects are described below, following the same conventions as above except 
 that <span class="v">:all</span> is not allowed.</li> 
 
 <li>Printing begins immediately if <span class="v">start-goals-spec</span> is <span class="v">:all</span>, else 
 begins with the first goal whose name is in the set of start goal names.</li> 
 
 <li>If the set of stop goal names is empty (as is the case when the second 
 optional argument is omitted), then printing takes place only for the first 
 goal whose name is in the set of start goal names.  Otherwise, printing 
 continues starting with that goal, stopping only when a goal in the list of 
 stop goal names is encountered, without any printing for that goal.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Note that saved prover output is cleared at every top-level prover call, 
 including such calls made by: <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> (e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>), <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span>, and <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> commands that invoke the 
 prover.  A single event can make more than one top-level prover call, for 
 example: in the case of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, one call made for termination and 
 another for guard verification; and in the case of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, one call 
 made for the proposed theorem and one for each <a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a>. If you want 
 to see more than one proof log for a single top-level form, then instead of 
 using <span class="v">:pso</span>, first evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> nil)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The ``Time'' printed in the summary shows the original times for the proof 
 attempt, not the times for processing the <span class="v">:pso</span> command.</p>
