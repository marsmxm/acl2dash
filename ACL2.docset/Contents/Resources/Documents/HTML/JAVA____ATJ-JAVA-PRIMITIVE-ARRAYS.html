<p>ATJ's representation of Java primitive arrays and operations on them.</p><p>In order to have ATJ generate Java code 
     that manipulates Java primitive arrays, 
     we use an approach similar to <a href="JAVA____ATJ-JAVA-PRIMITIVES.html">the one for Java primitive values</a>. We use ACL2 functions that correspond to 
     the Java primitive arrays and operations on them: 
     when ATJ encounters these specific ACL2 functions, 
     it translates them to corresponding Java constructs 
     that operate on Java primitive arrays; 
     this happens only when <span class="v">:deep</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">t</span>.</p><p>The discussion in <a href="JAVA____ATJ-JAVA-PRIMITIVES.html">atj-java-primitives</a> 
     about derivations targeting 
     the ACL2 functions that represent Java primitive values 
     applies to Java primitive arrays as well.</p><p>As discussed in <a href="JAVA____ATJ-JAVA-PRIMITIVE-ARRAY-MODEL.html">atj-java-primitive-array-model</a>, 
     currently the ACL2 functions that represent Java primitive arrays 
     are part of ATJ, but (perhaps some generalization of them) could be 
     part of the <a href="JAVA____LANGUAGE.html">language formalization</a> at some point.</p>
