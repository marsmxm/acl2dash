<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____MONITOR">Click for Monitor in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>To monitor the attempted application of a rule name</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> '(:rewrite assoc-of-app) 't)
:monitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app) t
(<a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> '(:r assoc-of-app) t)
:monitor (:r assoc-of-app) t
:monitor assoc-of-app t
:monitor (:definition app) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a> :target) '(app c d))
:monitor (:linear rule3) t</pre> 
 
 <p>In the examples above, the first four forms are equivalent; see <a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-COMMANDS.html">keyword-commands</a> and see <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>.  Those are equivalent to the fifth form 
 if the event <span class="v">assoc-of-app</span> corresponds to a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule, or more 
 precisely, to a single <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>, <span class="v">(:rewrite assoc-of-app)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> x condition)
:monitor y z ; same as (<a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> 'y 'z)
(<a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> x condition t) ; same as above, but avoiding output</pre> 
 
 <p>where we focus below on the first form, in which the arguments are 
 evaluated.  The second form quotes its arguments; see <a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-COMMANDS.html">keyword-commands</a>. 
 The third form is a quiet version of the first that avoids the need to invoke 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a></span> explicitly, as discussed below.</p> 
 
 <p>Above, <span class="v">x</span> (or more precisely, the result of evaluating <span class="v">x</span>) is a 
 runic designator (see <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>) other than a theory name (see <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>) and (the value of) <span class="v">condition</span> is a term, called the ``break 
 condition.'' If <span class="v">x</span> is not a symbol then it must designate a <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> 
 corresponding to a rule of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>, or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>.  If <span class="v">x</span> is a symbol then it 
 represents all such runes that it designates, and there must be at least one 
 such.  (Thus, <span class="v">x</span> cannot name an event that generates only rules of classes 
 other than those three.)</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Monitor</span> does not affect proof attempts until the <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> 
 utility is turned on with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a></span>, for example, using <span class="v">:brr t</span>.  For a 
 shortcut that does this automatically while avoiding output, see <a href="ACL2____MONITOR_12.html">monitor!</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When a <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> is <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed any attempt to apply it may result 
 in an interactive break in an ACL2 ``<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.''  There 
 you will get a chance to see how the application proceeds.  Whether an 
 interactive break occurs depends on the value of the break condition 
 expression associated with the <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>.  See <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> for a description of the interactive loop entered, and in 
 particular, for discussion of what happens if you monitor or unmonitor a rune 
 while inside a break (in short: the effect disappears when existing the break, 
 unless it is a top-level break).  Also see <a href="ACL2____SET-BRR-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-brr-evisc-tuple</a> for how 
 to see output in full.</p> 
 
 <p>NOTE: Some <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rules are considered ``simple abbreviations''; see 
 <a href="ACL2____SIMPLE.html">simple</a>.  These can be be monitored, but only at certain times during 
 the proof.  Monitoring is carried out by code inside the rewriter but 
 abbreviation rules may be applied by a special purpose simplifier inside the 
 so-called <i>preprocess</i> phase of a proof.  If you desire to monitor an 
 abbreviation rule, a warning will be printed suggesting that you may want to 
 supply the hint <span class="v">:DO-NOT '(PREPROCESS)</span>; see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  Without such a 
 hint, an abbreviation rule can be applied during the preprocess phase of a 
 proof, and no such application will cause an interactive break.</p> 
 
 <p>To remove a <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> from the list of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s, use 
 <span class="v">unmonitor</span>.  To see which <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s are <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed and what their 
 break conditions are, evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MONITORED-RUNES.html">monitored-runes</a>)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Monitor</span>, <span class="v">unmonitor</span> and <span class="v">monitored-runes</span> are macros that 
 expand into expressions involving <span class="v">state</span>.  While these macros appear to 
 return the list of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s this is an illusion.  They 
 all print <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> information to the comment window and 
 then return <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>s instructing <span class="v">ld</span> to print nothing.  It is 
 impossible to return the list of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s because it 
 exists only in the <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> with which you interact when a 
 break occurs.  This allows you to change the <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s and 
 their conditions during the course of a proof attempt without changing the 
 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> in which the the proof is being constructed.</p> 
 
 <p>Unconditional break points are obtained by using the break condition 
 <span class="v">t</span>.  We now discuss conditional break points.  The break condition, 
 <span class="v">condition</span>, must be a term that contains no free variables other than 
 <span class="v">state</span> and that returns a single non-<span class="v">state</span> result.  In fact, the 
 result should be <span class="v">nil</span>, <span class="v">t</span>, or a true list of commands to be fed to the 
 resulting interactive break.  Whenever the system attempts to use the 
 associated rule, the break condition (that is, <span class="v">condition</span>) is evaluated in 
 the <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> interaction <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  A break occurs only if the 
 result of evaluating <span class="v">condition</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  If the result is a true 
 list, that list is appended to the front of <span class="v">standard-oi</span> and hence is 
 taken as the initial user commands issued to the interactive break.</p> 
 
 <p>In order to develop effective break conditions it must be possible to 
 access context sensitive information, i.e., information about the context in 
 which the <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> is being tried.  The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a></span> macro 
 may be used in break conditions to access such information as the term being 
 rewritten and the current governing assumptions.  This information is not 
 stored in the proof <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> but is transferred into the <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> 
 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> when breaks occur.  The macro form is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a> :sym)</span> where 
 <span class="v">:sym</span> is one of several keyword symbols, including <span class="v">:target</span> (the term 
 being rewritten), <span class="v">:unify-subst</span> (the substitution that instantiates the 
 left-hand side of the conclusion of the rule so that it is the target term), 
 and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-ALIST.html">type-alist</a></span> (the governing assumptions).  See <a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For example,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:monitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app)
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a> :target) '(app a (app b c)))</pre> 
 
 <p>will monitor <span class="v">(:rewrite assoc-of-app)</span> but will cause an interactive 
 break only when the target term, the term being rewritten, is <span class="v">(app a (app b
 c))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Because break conditions are evaluated in the interaction environment, the 
 user developing a break condition for a given <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> can test candidate 
 break conditions before installing them.  For example, suppose an 
 unconditional break has been installed on a <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>, that an interactive 
 break has occurred and that the user has determined both that this particular 
 application is uninteresting and that many more such applications will likely 
 occur.  An appropriate response would be to develop an expression that 
 recognizes such applications and returns <span class="v">nil</span>.  Of course, the hard task 
 is figuring out what makes the current application uninteresting.  But once a 
 candidate expression is developed, the user can evaluate it in the current 
 context simply to confirm that it returns <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Recall that when a break condition returns a non-<span class="v">nil</span> true list that 
 list is appended to the front of <span class="v">standard-oi</span>.  For example,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:monitor (:rewrite assoc-of-app) '(:go)</pre> 
 
 <p>will cause <span class="v">(:rewrite assoc-of-app)</span> to be <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed and will 
 make the break condition be <span class="v">'(:go)</span>.  This break condition always 
 evaluates the non-<span class="v">nil</span> true list <span class="v">(:go)</span>.  Thus, an interactive break 
 will occur every time <span class="v">(:rewrite assoc-of-app)</span> is tried.  The break is fed 
 the command <span class="v">:go</span>.  Now the command <span class="v">:go</span> causes <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> to 
 (a) evaluate the attempt to apply the lemma, (b) print the result of that 
 attempt, and (c) exit from the interactive break and let the proof attempt 
 continue.  Thus, in effect, the above <span class="v">:monitor</span> merely ``traces'' the 
 attempted applications of the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> but never causes an interactive 
 break requiring input from the user.</p> 
 
 <p>It is possible to use this feature to cause a conditional break where the 
 effective break condition is tested <b>after</b> the lemma has been tried. 
 For example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:monitor (:rewrite lemma12)
                '(:unify-subst
                  :eval$ nil
                  :ok-if (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a> :wonp))
                             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a> :rewritten-rhs) '(foo a))))
                  :rewritten-rhs)</pre> 
 
 <p>causes the following behavior when <span class="v">(:rewrite lemma12)</span> is tried.  A 
 break always occurs, but it is fed the commands above.  The first, 
 <span class="v">:unify-subst</span>, causes <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> to print out the unifying 
 substitution.  Then in response to <span class="v">:eval$</span> <span class="v">nil</span> the lemma is tried but 
 with all <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s temporarily <a href="ACL2____UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a>ed.  Thus no breaks will 
 occur during the rewriting of the hypotheses of the lemma.  When the attempt 
 has been made, control returns to <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> (which will print the 
 results of the attempt, i.e., whether the lemma was applied, if so what the 
 result is, if not why it failed).  The next command, the <span class="v">:ok-if</span> with its 
 following expression, is a conditional exit command.  It means exit 
 <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> if either the attempt was unsuccessful, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a>
 :wonp))</span>, or if the result of the rewrite is any term other than <span class="v">(foo
 a)</span>.  If this condition is met, the break is exited and the remaining break 
 commands are irrelevant.  If this condition is not met then the next command, 
 <span class="v">:rewritten-rhs</span>, prints the result of the application (which in this 
 contrived example is known to be <span class="v">(foo a)</span>).  Finally, the list of supplied 
 commands is exhausted but <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> expects more input.  Therefore, 
 it begins prompting the user for input.  The end result, then, of the above 
 <span class="v">:monitor</span> command is that the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> in question is elaborately 
 traced and interactive breaks occur whenever it rewrites its target to <span class="v">(foo
 a)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We recognize that the above break condition is fairly arcane.  We suspect 
 that with experience we will develop some useful idioms.  For example, it is 
 straightforward now to define macros that monitor <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s in the ways 
 suggested by the following names: <span class="v">trace-rune</span>, <span class="v">break-if-target-is</span>, 
 and <span class="v">break-if-result-is</span>.  For example, the last could be defined as</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> break-if-result-is (<a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> term)
  `(<a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> ',rune
            '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a> (:eval :ok-if
                           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a> :rewritten-rhs) ',term))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>(Note however that the submitted term must be in translated form.)</p> 
 
 <p>Since we don't have any experience with this kind of control on lemmas we 
 thought it best to provide a general (if arcane) mechanism and hope that the 
 ACL2 community will develop the special cases that we find most 
 convenient.</p>
