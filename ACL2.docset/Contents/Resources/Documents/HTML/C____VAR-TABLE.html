<p>Fixtype of variable tables, i.e. symbol tables for variables.</p><p>This keeps track of all the variables in scope [C:6.2.1], 
     organized according to block scopes. 
     The list has one element for each nested block, 
     where the first element (the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>) 
     corresponds to the innermost block: 
     this order is natural, as blocks are added via <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span>. 
     The list is never empty: 
     we always initialize the variable table one (empty) block.</p><p>Currently we do not support variables with file scope. 
     Thus, all the scopes here are block scopes.</p><p>It is possible for two scopes in the list to have overlapping keys, 
     when a variable in an inner block hides one in an outer block 
     [C:6.2.1/4].</p>
