<p>Notes about <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>, especially pertaining to expensive resizing 
 operations</p><p>Certain ``Hons-Notes'' are printed to the terminal to report 
 implementation-level information about the management of <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a> 
 structures.  Some of these may be low-level and of interest mainly to system 
 developers.  But below we discuss what users can learn from a particular 
 hons-note, ``ADDR-LIMIT reached''.  In short: If you are seeing a lot of such 
 hons-notes, then you may be using a lot of memory.  (Maybe you can reduce that 
 memory; for certain BDD operations, for example (as defined in community books 
 <span class="v">books/centaur/ubdds/</span>), variable ordering can make a big difference.)</p> 
 
 <p>By way of background:</p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p>The ADDR-HT is the main hash table that lets us look up <a href="ACL2____NORMED.html">normed</a> conses, i.e., <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>es.  It is an ordinary Common Lisp hash 
 table, so when it starts to get too full the Lisp will grow it.  It can get 
 really big.  (It has been seen to take more than 10 GB of memory just for the 
 hash table's array, not to mention the actual conses!)</p> 
 
 <p>Hons-Notes may be printed when the ADDR-HT is getting really full.  This 
 growth can be expensive and can lead to memory problems.  Think about what it 
 takes to resize a hash table:</p> 
 
 <p>(1) allocate a new, bigger array<br> 
 
   (2) rehash elements, copying them into the new array<br> 
 
   (3) free the old array</p> 
 
 <p>Until you reach step (3) and a garbage collection takes place, you have to 
 have enough memory to have both the old and new arrays allocated.  If the old 
 array was 10 GB and we want to allocate a new one that's 15 GB, this can get 
 pretty bad.  Also, rehashing the elements is expensive time-wise when there 
 are lots of elements.</p> 
 
 <p>Since resizing a hash table is expensive, we want to avoid it.  There's a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-RESIZE.html">hons-resize</a></span> command for this.  You may want your books to start with 
 something like the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> (<a href="ACL2____SET-MAX-MEM.html">set-max-mem</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 30 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 30))))      ; 30 GB heap
(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> (<a href="ACL2____HONS-RESIZE.html">hons-resize</a> :addr-ht #u_100_000_000)) ; 100M honses</pre> 
 
 <p>Basically, if you roughly know how many honses your book will need, you can 
 just get them up front and then never to resize.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>The Hons-Notes about ``ADDR-LIMIT reached'' are basically there to warn you 
 that the ADDR-HT is being resized.  This can help you realize that your <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-RESIZE.html">hons-resize</a></span> command had too small of an ADDR-HT size, or might suggest that 
 your book should have a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-RESIZE.html">hons-resize</a></span> command.  There are also commands 
 like <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-SUMMARY.html">hons-summary</a></span><span class="v">)</span>, <a href="ACL2____SET-MAX-MEM.html">set-max-mem</a>, and defined in 
 community book <span class="v">books/centaur/misc/memory-mgmt-logic.lisp</span>, 
 <span class="v">(hons-analyze-memory nil)</span>.  These can show you how many honses you 
 currently have, how much space they are taking, and that sort of thing.  (A 
 nice trick is to call <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-SUMMARY.html">hons-summary</a></span> at the end of a book, to get an 
 idea of how many honses you should ask for in your <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-RESIZE.html">hons-resize</a></span> 
 command).</p>
