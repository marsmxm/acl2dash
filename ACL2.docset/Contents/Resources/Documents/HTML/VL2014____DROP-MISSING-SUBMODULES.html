<p>(Unsound transform) Remove instances of missing submodules.</p><p>In our ordinary transformation process, e.g., <a href="VL2014____VL-SIMPLIFY.html">vl-simplify</a>, 
modules that instance an undefined submodule are thrown out with fatal 
errors.</p> 
 
<p>In <a href="VL2014____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a>, we still want to analyze them as much as we can.  So, in 
this transformation, we simply delete any instances of missing submodules, 
perhaps leaving us with "partial" superior modules.</p> 
 
<p>This is obviously unsound and should never be used in our ordinary 
transformation process.</p>
