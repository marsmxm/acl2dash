<p>List of compound recognizer rules for the proofs generated by ATC.</p><p>The type prescription rules in <span class="tt"><a href="C_____A2ATC-TYPE-PRESCRIPTION-RULES_A2.html">*atc-type-prescription-rules*</a></span> 
     cover all the shallowly embedded C expressions except for variables. 
     In the scenarios explained in <span class="tt"><a href="C_____A2ATC-TYPE-PRESCRIPTION-RULES_A2.html">*atc-type-prescription-rules*</a></span>, 
     we may need to establish that a variable is not <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     which must follow from the guard hypotheses. 
     For this, we use the compound recognizer rule below. 
     The fact that the type is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span> is actually not important; 
     what is important is that it does not include <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     i.e. it is logically true.</p><p><b>Definition: </b>*atc-compound-recognizer-rules*</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a>
