 <p>where <span class="v">fn</span> is the symbol you wish to define and is a new symbolic <a href="ACL2____NAME.html">name</a>, <span class="v">(var1 ... varn)</span> is its list of formal parameters, the optional 
 <span class="v">dcl_i</span> forms are <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> forms, and <span class="v">body</span> is its body, which 
 must be quantified as described below.  The other arguments are explained 
 below.</p> 
 
 <p>For a simple example, see <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">defun-sk-example</a>.  For a more elaborate 
 example, see <a href="ACL2____TUTORIAL4-DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">Tutorial4-Defun-Sk-Example</a>.  See <a href="ACL2____QUANTIFIER-TUTORIAL.html">quantifier-tutorial</a> for a careful beginner's introduction that takes you 
 through typical kinds of quantifier-based reasoning in ACL2.  Also see <a href="ACL2____QUANTIFIERS.html">quantifiers</a> for an example illustrating how the use of recursion, rather than 
 explicit quantification with <span class="v">defun-sk</span>, may be preferable.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we describe the <span class="v">defun-sk</span> event precisely.  First, let us 
 consider the examples above.  The first example, again, is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> exists-x-p0-and-q0 (y z)
  (<a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a> x
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z)
               (q0 x y z))))</pre> 
 
 <p>It is intended to represent the predicate with formal parameters <span class="v">y</span> and 
 <span class="v">z</span> that holds when for some <span class="v">x</span>, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))</span> 
 holds.  In fact <span class="v">defun-sk</span> is a macro, and the call above adds the 
 following two <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, as shown just below.  The first event guarantees 
 that if this new predicate holds of <span class="v">y</span> and <span class="v">z</span>, then the term shown, 
 <span class="v">(exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness y z)</span>, is an example of the <span class="v">x</span> that is 
 therefore supposed to exist.  (Intuitively, we are axiomatizing 
 <span class="v">exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness</span> to pick a witness if there is one.  We comment 
 below on the use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a></span>; for now, consider <span class="v">defun-nx</span> to be 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.)  Conversely, the second event below guarantees that if there 
 is any <span class="v">x</span> for which the term in question holds, then the new predicate 
 does indeed hold of <span class="v">y</span> and <span class="v">z</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a> exists-x-p0-and-q0 (y z)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((x (exists-x-p0-and-q0-witness y z)))
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> exists-x-p0-and-q0-suff
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))
           (exists-x-p0-and-q0 y z)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now let us look at the third example from the introduction above:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
  (<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (x y)
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z)
               (q0 x y z))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The intention is to introduce a new predicate <span class="v">(forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z)</span> 
 which states that the indicated conjunction holds of all <span class="v">x</span> and all <span class="v">y</span> 
 together with the given <span class="v">z</span>.  This time, the axioms introduced are as shown 
 below.  The first event guarantees that if the application of function 
 <span class="v">forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-witness</span> to <span class="v">z</span> picks out values <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span> 
 for which the given term <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))</span> holds, then the new 
 predicate <span class="v">forall-x-y-p0-and-q0</span> holds of <span class="v">z</span>.  Conversely, the 
 (contrapositive of) the second axiom guarantees that if the new predicate 
 holds of <span class="v">z</span>, then the given term holds for all choices of <span class="v">x</span> and 
 <span class="v">y</span> (and that same <span class="v">z</span>).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a> forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
  (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a> (x y)
          (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-witness z)
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z)))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The examples above suggest the critical property of <span class="v">defun-sk</span>: it 
 indeed does introduce the quantified notions that it claims to introduce.</p> 
 
 <p>Notice that the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event just above, 
 <span class="v">forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc</span>, may not be of optimal form as a rewrite rule. 
 Users sometimes find that when the quantifier is <span class="v">forall</span>, it is useful to 
 state this rule in a form where the new quantified predicate is a hypothesis 
 instead.  In this case that form would be as follows:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> forall-x-y-p0-and-q0-necc
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 z)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z) (q0 x y z))))</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 will turn this into one <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule for each conjunct, 
 <span class="v">(p0 x y z)</span> and <span class="v">(q0 x y z)</span>, with hypothesis <span class="v">(forall-x-y-p0-and-q0
 z)</span> in each case.  In order to get this effect, use <span class="v">:rewrite :direct</span>, in 
 this case as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> forall-x-y-p0-and-q0 (z)
  (<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (x y)
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p0 x y z)
               (q0 x y z)))
  :rewrite :direct)</pre> 
 
 <p>We now turn to a detailed description of <span class="v">defun-sk</span>, starting with a 
 discussion of its arguments as shown in the "General Form" above.</p> 
 
 <p>The third argument, <span class="v">body</span>, must be of the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____Q.html">Q</a> bound-vars term)</pre> 
 
 <p>where: <span class="v">Q</span> is the symbol <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a></span>, in the 
 "ACL2" package; <span class="v">bound-vars</span> is a variable or true list of variables 
 disjoint from <span class="v">(var1 ... varn)</span> and not including <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>; and 
 <span class="v">term</span> is a term.  The case that <span class="v">bound-vars</span> is a single variable 
 <span class="v">v</span> is treated exactly the same as the case that <span class="v">bound-vars</span> is 
 <span class="v">(v)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The result of this event is to introduce a ``Skolem function,'' whose name 
 is the keyword argument <span class="v">skolem-name</span> if that is supplied, and otherwise is 
 the result of modifying <span class="v">fn</span> by suffixing "-WITNESS" to its name.  The 
 following definition (or a corresponding rule; see the discussion of 
 <span class="v">:constrain</span> below) and one of the following two theorems (as indicated) 
 are introduced for <span class="v">skolem-name</span> and <span class="v">fn</span> in the case that 
 <span class="v">bound-vars</span> (see above) is a single variable <span class="v">v</span>.  The name of the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event may be supplied as the value of the keyword argument 
 <span class="v">:thm-name</span>; if it is not supplied, then it is the result of modifying 
 <span class="v">fn</span> by suffixing "-SUFF" to its name in the case that the quantifier is 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a></span>, and "-NECC" in the case that the quantifier is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a> fn (var1 ... varn)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((v (skolem-name var1 ... varn)))
    term))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> fn-suff ;in case the quantifier is EXISTS
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> term
           (fn var1 ... varn)))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> fn-necc ;in case the quantifier is FORALL
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> term)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (fn var1 ... varn))))</pre> 
 
 <p>In the <span class="v">forall</span> case, however, the keyword pair <span class="v">:rewrite :direct</span> 
 may be supplied after the body of the <span class="v">defun-sk</span> form, in which case the 
 contrapositive of the above form is used instead:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> fn-necc ;in case the quantifier is FORALL
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (fn var1 ... varn)
           term))</pre> 
 
 <p>This is often a better choice for the "-NECC" rule, provided ACL2 can 
 parse <span class="v">term</span> as a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule.  A second possible value of 
 the <span class="v">:rewrite</span> argument of <span class="v">defun-sk</span> is <span class="v">:default</span>, which gives the 
 same behavior as when <span class="v">:rewrite</span> is omitted.  Otherwise, the value of 
 <span class="v">:rewrite</span> should be the term to use as the body of the <span class="v">fn-necc</span> 
 theorem shown above; ACL2 will attempt to do the requisite proof in this case. 
 If that term is weaker than the default, the properties introduced by 
 <span class="v">defun-sk</span> may of course be weaker than they would be otherwise.  Finally, 
 note that the <span class="v">:rewrite</span> keyword argument for <span class="v">defun-sk</span> only makes 
 sense if the quantifier is <span class="v">forall</span>; it is thus illegal if the quantifier 
 is <span class="v">exists</span>.  Enough said about <span class="v">:rewrite</span>!</p> 
 
 <p>In the case that <span class="v">bound-vars</span> is a list of at least two variables, say 
 <span class="v">(bv1 ... bvk)</span>, the definition above (with no keywords) is the following 
 instead, but the theorem remains unchanged.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a> fn (var1 ... varn)
  (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a> (bv1 ... bvk)
          (skolem-name var1 ... varn)
          term))</pre> 
 
 <p>In order to emphasize that the last element of the list, <span class="v">body</span>, is a 
 term, <span class="v">defun-sk</span> checks that the symbols <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a></span> 
 do not appear anywhere in it.  However, on rare occasions one might 
 deliberately choose to violate this convention, presumably because <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a></span> is being used as a variable or because a macro call 
 will be eliminating ``calls of'' <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a></span>.  In these 
 cases, the keyword argument <span class="v">quant-ok</span> may be supplied a non-<span class="v">nil</span> 
 value.  Then <span class="v">defun-sk</span> will permit <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a></span> in 
 the body, but it will still cause an error if there is a real attempt to use 
 these symbols as quantifiers.</p> 
 
 <p>The use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a></span> above, rather than <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, disables 
 certain checks that are required for evaluation, for example in the passing of 
 multiple values.  However, there is a price: calls of these defined functions 
 cannot be evaluated; see <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a>.  Normally that is not a problem, 
 since these notions involve quantifiers.  But if you prefer that <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> 
 be used instead of <span class="v">defun-nx</span>, you can arrange that using <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> 
 forms, given as the <span class="v">dcl_i</span> as shown above.  These will become the 
 <span class="v">declare</span> forms in the generated <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.  If the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARATION.html">declaration</a> form <span class="v">:non-executable nil</span> is supplied, then <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> 
 will be used in place of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">Guard</a> verification is performed for <span class="v">defun-sk</span> events under the 
 same conditions as for <span class="v">defun</span> events.  (An exception, ignored here but 
 discussed in a later paragraph below, occurs when keyword argument 
 <span class="v">:constrain t</span> is supplied.)  Thus, by default, guard verification will be 
 attempted exactly when at least one of <span class="v">type</span>, <span class="v">:guard</span>, or 
 <span class="v">:verify-guards t</span> is specified in a declaration (that is, in some 
 <span class="v">dcl_i</span>.  This default behavior can be modified just as it is for 
 <span class="v">defun</span>; see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-VERIFY-GUARDS-EAGERNESS.html">set-verify-guards-eagerness</a></span>.  Technical note: such 
 guard verification is implemented through a generated call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> after the <span class="v">encapsulate</span> that surrounds the definitions 
 introduced; use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS1.html">trans1</a></span> to see the expansion.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Defun-sk</span> is a macro implemented using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span>.  Hence, it 
 should only be executed in <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>; see <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>.  You can use the command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PCB_12.html">pcb!</a></span> to see the event generated by a call of the <span class="v">defun-sk</span> macro.  If you 
 want to watch the subsidiary events (including the <span class="v">defchoose</span> event) as 
 they are being executed, use keyword option <span class="v">:verbose t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>An advanced feature is argument <span class="v">:strengthen t</span>, which generates the 
 extra constraint that is generated for the corresponding <span class="v">defchoose</span> event; 
 see <a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>.  The name of that generated theorem will be obtained by 
 adding the suffix <span class="v">"-STRENGTHEN"</span> to the function symbol being defined, 
 in the same package.</p> 
 
 <p>If you find that the rewrite rules introduced with a particular use of 
 <span class="v">defun-sk</span> are not ideal, even when using the <span class="v">:rewrite</span> keyword 
 discussed above (in the <span class="v">forall</span> case), then at least two reasonable 
 courses of action are available for you.  Perhaps the best option is to prove 
 the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules you want.  If you see a pattern for creating rewrite 
 rules from your <span class="v">defun-sk</span> events, you might want to write a macro that 
 executes a <span class="v">defun-sk</span> followed by one or more <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> events. 
 Another option is to write your own variant of the <span class="v">defun-sk</span> macro, say, 
 <span class="v">my-defun-sk</span>, for example by modifying a copy of the definition of 
 <span class="v">defun-sk</span> from the ACL2 sources.</p> 
 
 <p>There is one more keyword argument not explained above: <span class="v">:constrain</span>. 
 The default is <span class="v">nil</span>; otherwise this argument must be a symbol, which we 
 call <span class="v">name-def</span>, except that in the case of <span class="v">t</span>, <span class="v">name-def</span> is 
 obtained by adding the suffix <span class="v">"-DEFINITION"</span> to <span class="v">fn</span>.  For a 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> <span class="v">:constrain</span> argument, this <span class="v">name-def</span> is the name of a 
 rule of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> that equates <span class="v">(fn var1 ... varn)</span> 
 with the body of the definition of <span class="v">fn</span>.  Furthermore, in this case of a 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> <span class="v">:constrain</span> value the definition of <span class="v">fn</span> is local to the 
 surrounding <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, which contains a signature for <span class="v">fn</span>.  As 
 usual, the simplest way to see the effects of <span class="v">:constrain</span> may be to apply 
 <span class="v">:trans1</span> to your <span class="v">defun-sk</span> form.  Note that constraining the function 
 can make it possible to attach to it (see <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>) and to introduce 
 it as a <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified function.  Also note that when <span class="v">:constrain t</span> 
 is specified: the guard of <span class="v">fn</span> will automatically be <span class="v">t</span>, no guard 
 verification will be performed, and <span class="v">fn</span> will nevertheless be a 
 guard-verified (and constrained) function.</p> 
 
 <p>If you want to represent nested quantifiers, you can use more than one 
 <span class="v">defun-sk</span> event.  For example, in order to represent</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> x (<a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a> y (p x y z)))</pre> 
 
 <p>you can use <span class="v">defun-sk</span> twice, for example as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> exists-y-p (x z)
  (<a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a> y (p x y z)))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> forall-x-exists-y-p (z)
  (<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> x (exists-y-p x z)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Some distracting and unimportant warnings are inhibited during 
 <span class="v">defun-sk</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note for ACL2(r) users (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>): In ACL2(r), the keyword 
 <span class="v">:CLASSICALP</span> is also supported.  Its legal values are <span class="v">t</span> (the default) 
 and <span class="v">nil</span>, and it determines whether or not (respectively) ACL2(r) will 
 consider <span class="v">fn</span> to be a classical function.  It must be the case that the 
 value is <span class="v">t</span> (perhaps implicitly, by default) if and only if <span class="v">body</span> is 
 classical.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that this way of implementing quantifiers is not a new idea.  Hilbert 
 was certainly aware of it in the first half of the 20th century!  Also see 
 <a href="ACL2____CONSERVATIVITY-OF-DEFCHOOSE.html">conservativity-of-defchoose</a> for a technical argument that justifies the 
 logical conservativity of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> event in the sense of the 
 paper by Kaufmann and Moore entitled ``Structured Theory Development for a 
 Mechanized Logic'' (Journal of Automated Reasoning 26, no. 2 (2001), 
 pp. 161–203).</p>
