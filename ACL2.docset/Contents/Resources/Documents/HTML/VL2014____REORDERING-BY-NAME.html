<p>Functions for reordering lists of parsed objects by their names.</p><p>We implement functions for rearranging design elements into a 
different order.</p> 
 
<p>In most ways, these functions are similar to the functions for <a href="VL2014____FILTERING-BY-NAME.html">filtering-by-name</a>.  However, the name filtering functions preserve the order 
of the input list, whereas these functions explicitly reorder the elements to 
match the order of the names.</p> 
 
<p>This can be useful in various places, e.g., dependency ordering for modules 
or functions, reordering for port declarations in UDPs, etc.</p> 
 
<p>These functions are reasonably efficient, i.e., if the list to reorder is 
long, we build a temporary fast alist to speed up the lookups.  This 
optimization is logically invisible via <a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a>.</p>
