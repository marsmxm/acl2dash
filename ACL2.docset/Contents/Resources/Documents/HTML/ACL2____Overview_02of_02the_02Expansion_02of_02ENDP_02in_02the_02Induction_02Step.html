<p>Overview of the Expansion of ENDP in the Induction Step</p><p>In this message the system is saying that <span class="v">Subgoal *1/2</span> has 
 been rewritten to the <span class="v">Subgoal *1/2'</span>, by expanding the definition of 
 <b>endp</b>.  This is an example of <b>simplification</b>, one of the main 
 proof techniques used by the theorem prover.</p>
