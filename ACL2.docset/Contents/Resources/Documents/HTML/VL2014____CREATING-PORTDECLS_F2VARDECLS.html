<p>Utilities for the initial creation of port declarations and (if the 
port declaration is complete) corresponding net declarations.</p><p>The creation of port declarations and net declarations is very 
subtle.  See also <a href="VL2014____PORTDECL-SIGN.html">portdecl-sign</a> and <a href="VL2014____MAKE-IMPLICIT-WIRES.html">make-implicit-wires</a>.</p> 
 
<p>From Verilog-2005, page 174:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>If a port declaration includes a net or variable type, then the port is 
considered completely declared and it is an error for the port to be declared 
again in a variable or net data type declaration...</li> 
 
<li>If the port declaration does NOT include a net or variable type, then the 
port can be declared again in a net or variable declaration.  If the net or 
variable is declared as a vector, the range specification between the two 
declarations shall be identical.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>So if the parser encounters a port declaration with a net or variable type, 
the port is completely declared and we are going to generate both (1) a port 
declaration and (2) the corresponding net declaration.</p> 
 
<p>However, if we have no net type, then we'll instead only add the port 
declaration, which we will mark with the attribute 
<span class="v">VL_INCOMPLETE_DECLARATION</span>.  The corresponding net will either be found 
later in the module, or will be added automatically with the <a href="VL2014____MAKE-IMPLICIT-WIRES.html">make-implicit-wires</a> transform.  Signedness is handled last, by <a href="VL2014____PORTDECL-SIGN.html">portdecl-sign</a>.</p>
