<dd>Any attribute associated with this expression.  As with literals, 
             these attributes are not accessible in the Verilog or 
             SystemVerilog grammars.  However, it is generally convenient to be 
             able to associate attributes with any expression, so we include an 
             attributes field in our internal representation.</dd>
