<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2-PC____BASH">Click for ACL2-pc::bash in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>(atomic macro) 
call the ACL2 theorem prover's simplifier</p><pre class="code">Examples:
bash -- attempt to prove the current goal by simplification alone
(<a href="ACL2____BASH.html">bash</a> ("Subgoal 2" :by foo) ("Subgoal 1" :use bar))
     -- attempt to prove the current goal by simplification alone,
        with the indicated hints

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____BASH.html">bash</a> &amp;rest hints)</pre> 
 
 <p>Call the theorem prover's simplifier, creating a subgoal for each resulting 
 goal.</p> 
 
 <p>Notice that unlike <span class="v">prove</span>, the arguments to <span class="v">bash</span> are spread out, 
 and are all hints.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Bash</span> is similar to <span class="v">reduce</span> in that neither of these allows 
 induction.  But <span class="v">bash</span> only allows simplification, while <span class="v">reduce</span> allows 
 processes <span class="v">eliminate-destructors</span>, <span class="v">fertilize</span>, <span class="v">generalize</span>, and 
 <span class="v">eliminate-irrelevance</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> All forcing rounds will be skipped (unless there are more 
 than 15 subgoals generated in the first forcing round, an injustice that 
 should be rectified, but might remain unless there is pressure to fix 
 it).</p>
