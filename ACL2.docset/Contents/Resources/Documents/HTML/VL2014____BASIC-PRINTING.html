<p>Primitive routines for printing objects.</p><p>Our printer is intended to support both text and html output. 
Printing HTML is subtle because one may wish to write:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<b>HTML markup</b> (e.g., &lt;b&gt;, &lt;code&gt;, ...), wherein the 
special characters like &lt; are not to be changed, are going to be invisible 
to the user, and should not affect the column number,</li> 
 
<li>
<b>Parts of URLs</b> (e.g., filenames), which must be "percent encoded" 
per RFC 3986, e.g., spaces become %20.  These, too, do not affect the column 
number because they take part only in tags such as &lt;a href="..."&gt;, 
and</li> 
 
<li>
<b>Encoded HTML text</b>, where special characters like &amp; and &lt; 
become &amp;amp; and &amp;lt;, and where tabs become a litany of &amp;nbsp; 
characters, and where the column should be advanced as the text is 
printed.</li> 
 
</ul>
