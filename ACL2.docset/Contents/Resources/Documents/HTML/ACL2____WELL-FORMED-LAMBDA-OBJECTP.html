  <p><span class="v">Well-formed-lambda-objectp</span> is a <span class="v">:program</span> mode function that 
  checks the well-formedness of an arbitrary ACL2 object being used as a 
  <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <p>Before we tell you what ``well-formedness'' means in this context we 
  collect some random related facts that we consider more important than its 
  precise meaning!</p> 
 
  <p><span class="v">Lambda$</span> terms always translate to quoted well-formed <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
  objects unless translate signals an explanatory error.  Don't try to type 
  well-formed <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects as explicitly quoted constants.  Use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a></span>!</p> 
 
  <p>Only well-formed <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects can be compiled.  Use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <p>But the compiled code is not necessarily always run when a well-formed 
  <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object is <span class="v">apply$</span>d!  The object must additionally be guard 
  verified and its guards must be satisfied by the arguments supplied by 
  <span class="v">apply$</span>.  Well-formedness does not do guard verification.</p> 
 
  <p>The definitional axiom for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> knows nothing about 
  well-formedness.  It checks that the purported <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object satisfies 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAMEP-LAMBDAP.html">tamep-lambdap</a></span>, which is a simpler <span class="v">:logic</span> mode concept.  If you 
  are writing a definition or theorem about an arbitrary object to be used as a 
  <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object by <span class="v">apply$</span>, and want to restrict it to the kind of 
  objects handled as <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects by <span class="v">apply$</span>, use the predicate 
  <span class="v">tamep-lambdap</span> to characterize the object.  (Since 
  <span class="v">well-formed-lambda-objectp</span> is in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode and requires 
  access to the world, using it in a <span class="v">:logic</span> mode context would involve a 
  lot of work!)</p> 
 
  <p>Well-formedness implies tameness.  So if you write your <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
  objects with <span class="v">lambda$</span> <span class="v">apply$</span> will be able to handle them. But 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> can handle more objects than the Common Lisp compiler can.  Some 
  tame <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects can be applied faster than others.  The fast ones 
  are recognized by <span class="v">well-formed-lambda-objectp</span> -- but also have to be 
  guard verified and guard checked.  Applications of ill-formed but tame 
  <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects are evaluable, but the evaluation is done more slowly. 
  See the performance comparison in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PRINT-CL-CACHE.html">print-cl-cache</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <p>We compare well-formedness to tameness at the end of this topic.</p> 
 
  <p>You can't call this predicate on a <span class="v">lambda$</span> term, as by</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____WELL-FORMED-LAMBDA-OBJECTP.html">well-formed-lambda-objectp</a> (<a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a> (x) x) (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</pre> 
 
  <p>because <span class="v">lambda$</span> can only be called in slots of ilk <span class="v">:FN</span>. 
  Furthermore, there's no point!  <span class="v">Lambda$</span> terms always translate to 
  well-formed <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects unless an explanatory error is signalled by 
  translation.</p> 
 
  <p>If you want to <i>see</i> the translation of a <span class="v">lambda$</span> term, e.g., to 
  copy the text and modify it to produce some similar <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object, 
  use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANSLAM.html">translam</a></span>.  We sometimes do this to explore by example the 
  restrictions on well-formedness.</p> 
 
  <p>If you have a <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object, e.g., one printed by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PRINT-CL-CACHE.html">print-cl-cache</a></span>, that you suspect is ill-formed, this function won't tell you 
  <i>why</i> it is ill-formed!  It will just tell you whether it's ill-formed. 
  If you want to know why, translate the quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object with 
  <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANSLAM.html">translam</a></span>, which generates sometimes verbose error messages.</p> 
 
  <p>The global setting of <span class="v">set-ignore-ok</span> has no effect on well-formedness 
  of <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects.  <span class="v">IGNORE</span> and <span class="v">IGNORABLE</span> declarations inside the 
  <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> are effective.</p>

  <p>There should be very few occasions on which you need to know what this 
  predicate checks!</p> 
 
  <p>That said, here are the rules enforced.</p> 
 
  <p>An object is a well-formed <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object iff it has one of the 
  following two forms:</p> 
  <pre class="code">(LAMBDA vars tbody)          ; ``simple''  LAMBDA object 
(LAMBDA vars tdcl tbody)     ; ``declared'' LAMBDA object 
</pre> 
 
  <p>where</p> 
 
  <ul> 
  <li><p><span class="v">vars</span> is a list of distinct legal variable names</p></li> 
 
  <li><p><span class="v">tdcl</span>, if present, is a <span class="v">DECLARE</span> form containing, at most, 
      <span class="v">TYPE</span>, <span class="v">IGNORE</span>, <span class="v">IGNORABLE</span>, and <span class="v">XARGS</span> keys.  The user of 
      <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a></span> may provide multiple <span class="v">DECLARE</span> forms but when 
      translated they are combined into one as shown here.</p></li> 
 
  <li><p>If an <span class="v">XARGS</span> key is present it has exactly this form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">XARGS</a>
      :GUARD tguard :SPLIT-TYPES T)</span>, where <span class="v">tguard</span> is a <i>fully 
      translated</i> logic mode term involving only the formal variables, 
      <span class="v">vars</span>.  Note that the user of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a></span> may supply 
      <span class="v">:SPLIT-TYPES</span> <span class="v">NIL</span> and may do so before or after the <span class="v">:GUARD</span>, 
      and the guard term need not be in translated form, but the resulting 
      <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object has the form described here.</p></li> 
 
  <li>
<p>The <span class="v">:GUARD</span> specified in <span class="v">XARGS</span> must include as a conjunct 
      every <span class="v">TYPE</span> expression generated by any <span class="v">TYPE</span> specs.  E.g., 
      <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">INTEGERP</a> x)</span> must be a conjunct of <span class="v">tguard</span> if <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">TYPE</a> INTEGER
      ... x ...)</span> is declared.  That is consistent with the <span class="v">:SPLIT-TYPES</span> 
      <span class="v">T</span> setting and means the guard does not need to be extended any 
      further with the <span class="v">TYPES</span>.  The point of this restriction is to 
      guarantee that the guard implies the types declared to the compiler.  But 
      this is a purely syntactic check and so may at times require entering 
      silly-looking guards.  For example, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">type</a> rational x) (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a>
      :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> x) :split-types t))</span> is ruled ill-formed because 
      <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> x)</span> is not a conjunct of the guard, even though it is 
      logically implied by the guard.  So you'd have to use <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">type</a>
      rational x) (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> x)
      'nil) :split-types t))</span>.  Note also that the guard is a fully translated 
      conjunction, i.e., an <span class="v">IF</span>, not an <span class="v">AND</span>!  Order of the conjuncts 
      does not matter.</p> 
 
      <p>Note: The guard need not be tame (or even fully badged) because guards 
      are irrelevant to the axioms of <span class="v">apply$</span>.  But guards must be in 
      <span class="v">:logic</span> mode from the outset because we may have to prove guard 
      obligations on-the-fly in evaluation (we do not want to try to convert 
      functions used in the guard from from <span class="v">:program</span> to <span class="v">:logic</span> mode 
      while doing an evaluation of an <span class="v">apply$</span>).</p>
</li> 
 
  <li>
<p><span class="v">tbody</span> is a fully translated, <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a> term, involving no free 
      variables and respecting the declared <span class="v">IGNORE</span> and <span class="v">IGNORABLE</span> 
      declarations.</p> 
 
      <p>Furthermore, in the case of a lambda object generated by <span class="v">lambda$</span>, 
      <span class="v">tbody</span> is a ``tagged'' version of the translation of the body used in 
      the <span class="v">lambda$</span> expression.  Tagging involves use of a special form 
      generated by <span class="v">tag-translated-lambda$-body</span> and recognized by 
      <span class="v">lambda$-bodyp</span>.  This form contains the untranslated <span class="v">lambda$</span> 
      expression as well as the translation of its body.  For example, 
      <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a> (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 x))</span> translates to the tagged lambda object 
      <span class="v">'(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">LAMBDA</a> (X) (<a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">RETURN-LAST</a> 'PROGN 'orig-form tbody))</span>, where 
      <span class="v">orig-form</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">LAMBDA$</a> (X) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 X))</span> and <span class="v">tbody</span> is 
      <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> '1 X)</span>.</p> 
 
      <p>It may be helpful to use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANSLAM.html">translam</a></span> to inspect examples of 
      the translations of <span class="v">lambda$</span> expressions.</p>
</li> 
 
  </ul> 
 
  <h3>The Differences Between Well-Formed and Merely Tame Lambda Objects</h3> 
 
  <p>Roughly put, tame <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects have to have one of the two basic 
  shapes described above (simple or declared), the listed formals merely have 
  to be symbols -- not necessarily variable symbols and not necessarily 
  distinct.  The declaration, if present, is completely irrelevant and the body 
  merely has to be a tame expression -- not necessarily closed with respect to 
  the formals or respecting of the any <span class="v">IGNORE</span> or <span class="v">IGNORABLE</span> 
  declarations.  The meaning assigned to such an object when applied to some 
  arguments is just the result delivered by <span class="v">ev$</span> under an alist formed by 
  pairing the formals -- including non-variables and any duplicates -- with the 
  actuals.  If a free variable is encountered, <span class="v">ev$</span> gives it the value 
  <span class="v">NIL</span> courtesy of <span class="v">assoc</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>This behavior is implemented by compiled Common Lisp only when 
  well-formedness, guard verification, and guard checking approve of the object 
  and its application.</p>
