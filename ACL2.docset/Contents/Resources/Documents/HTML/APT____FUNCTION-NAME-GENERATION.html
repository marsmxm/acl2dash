<p>How APT transformations generate function names.</p><p>APT transformations generate transformed functions from existing functions. 
     The names of the generated functions may be specified explicitly, 
     or may be automatically generated from the names of the existing functions, 
     according to some rules. 
     Certain APT transformations do that according to the rules described here. 
     These rules apply only to the APT transformations 
     whose user documentation explicitly references this XDOC topic.</p><p>The name generation rules described here are based on <a href="ACL2____NUMBERED-NAMES.html">numbered names</a>: see their topic first. 
     Roughly speaking, the application of an APT transformation 
     to a target function whose name is a numbered name 
     generates a new function with the next numbered name, 
     i.e. the numbered name with the same base as the target function 
     and with the smallest index greater than the one of the target function 
     that makes the new function's name fresh, i.e. valid for a new function. 
     Such an index is often one plus the index of the target function, 
     but in general it may be larger if that name already happens to exist 
     (which would not be a recommended way to organize an APT derivation, 
     but cannot be prevented in general). 
     If the target function name is not actually a numbered name, 
     for the purpose of generating a function with the next numbered name, 
     the non-existent index of the target function name is regarded to be 0; 
     thus, the next numbered name has often index 1 in this case.</p><p>Certain APT transformations, when applied to a target function, 
     generate a single new function. 
     These transformations have a <span class="v">:new-name</span> input, which is 
     either <span class="v">:auto</span> (the default) to specify automatic name generation, 
     or an explicitly specified symbol to use for the new function. 
     When the <span class="v">:new-name</span> input is <span class="v">:auto</span>, 
     the name of the new function is determined 
     just as explained in the previous paragraph.</p><p>Certain APT transformations may generate, besides the new function, 
     also an additional wrapper function, 
     This happens when the new function has different arguments 
     (different in number and/or in types) 
     from the target function: 
     the wrapper function has 
     the same number and types of arguments as the target function, 
     and calls the new function with suitable arguments, 
     i.e. it ``wraps'' the new function to match the old function, 
     ``bridging'' between the two sets of arguments. 
     The wrapper function is optional: 
     these transformations have a <span class="v">:wrapper</span> boolean input 
     that specifies whether the wrapper function is generated (<span class="v">t</span>) 
     or not (<span class="v">nil</span>, the default). 
     When the <span class="v">:wrapper</span> input is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     only the new function is generated, 
     and when the <span class="v">:new-name</span> input is <span class="v">:auto</span> 
     its name is again generated as explained above.</p><p>If instead the <span class="v">:wrapper</span> input is <span class="v">t</span>, 
     then another input of the transformation, <span class="v">:wrapper-name</span>, 
     becomes relevant 
     (this input may be present only if <span class="v">:wrapper</span> is <span class="v">t</span>). 
     Similarly to <span class="v">:new-name</span>, also <span class="v">:wrapper-name</span> may be 
     either <span class="v">:auto</span> to specify automatic name generation, 
     or a symbol to use as the wrapper function name. 
     Note that it is possible for 
     just one of <span class="v">:new-name</span> and <span class="v">:wrapper-name</span> to be <span class="v">:auto</span>, 
     not necessarily both. 
     The rules for automatic name generation are as follows:</p><ul>
<li>If neither <span class="v">:new-name</span> nor <span class="v">:wrapper-name</span> is <span class="v">:auto</span>, 
      then there is actually no automatic name generation.</li>
<li>If <span class="v">:new-name</span> is <span class="v">:auto</span> but <span class="v">:wrapper-name</span> is not, 
      the name of the new function is determined as above, 
      with the additional constraint that the new index must be such that 
      the resulting name is distinct from 
      the explicitly specified wrapper function name. 
      In a well-structured APT derivation, 
      this additional constraint is expected to be normally satisfied 
      by one plus the index of the target function.</li>
<li>If <span class="v">:wrapper-name</span> is <span class="v">:auto</span> but <span class="v">:new-name</span> is not, 
      the rules are the same as the previous case, 
      but with the roles of the new and wrapper function names swapped. 
      That is, the wrapper function name is a numberd name 
      whose base is the same as the target function, 
      and whose index is the smallest one that is 
      greater than the index of the target function 
      and also distinct from the explicitly specified new function name.</li>
<li>If both <span class="v">:new-name</span> and <span class="v">:wrapper-name</span> are <span class="v">:auto</span>, 
      then both the new and wrapper function names are numbered names, 
      determined as follows. 
      The base of the new function's name is 
      the concatenation of the target function's name followed by <span class="v">-aux</span>. 
      The base of the wrapper function's name is 
      the same as the target function's name. 
      The index of both new and wrapper function names is the smallest one 
      that is greater than the one of the target function 
      and that makes both the new and wrapper function names fresh. 
      In well-structured APT derivations, 
      this index is normally expected to be 
      just one plus the target function's index.</li>
</ul><p>The <span class="v">-aux</span> in the new function name in the last case above 
     means `auxiliary', which is a common naming convention 
     for the ``loop'' of a function (in this case, the non-wrapper 
     function).</p>
