<p>Functions to display or change contents of the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a></p><p>ACL2 keeps track of the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s that you have executed that 
 have extended the logic or the rule database, as by the definition of macros, 
 functions, etc.  Using the facilities in this section you can review the 
 sequence of commands executed so far.  For example, you can ask to see the 
 most recently executed command (by issuing <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a></span> <span class="v">:x</span>), or the 
 preceding 10 commands (by issuing <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PBT.html">pbt</a></span> <span class="v">:x-10</span>), or the 
 command that introduced a given function symbol, <span class="v">fn</span> (by issuing <span class="v">:pc
 fn</span>).  You can also undo back through some previous command (see <a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a>), 
 restoring the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> to what it was before the given 
 command.</p> 
 
 <p>The annotations printed in the margin in response to some of these commands 
 (including `P', `L', `V', `D', `d', 'M', and 'm') are explained in the 
 documentation for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Several technical terms are used in the documentation of the history 
 commands.  You must understand these terms to use the commands.  These terms 
 are documented with <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> entries of their own.  See <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>, see <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, see <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>, and see <a href="ACL2____LOGICAL-NAME.html">logical-name</a>.</p>
