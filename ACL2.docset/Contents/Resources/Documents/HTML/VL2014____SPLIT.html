<p>Split up expressions by generating new wires.</p><p>The basic idea of this transformation is to introduce temporary 
variables for sub-expressions, e.g., we might split up:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign w = a + b * c + d;</pre> 
 
<p>into a series of simpler assignments, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign t1 = b * c;
assign t2 = a + t1;
assign w = t2 + d;</pre> 
 
<p>Almost true: we split up expressions until they involve either 0 or 1 
operations.  The twist is that we don't split up expressions that consist of 
"mere wiring", e.g., concatenation and bit- or part-selects.  More precisely, 
we don't split up expressions that are already atomic or <i>sliceable</i>; see 
<a href="VL2014____EXPR-SLICING.html">expr-slicing</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Splitting up expressions involves creating new wire declarations and 
assignments to those wires.  Sometimes the new modules are much bigger than the 
old modules.  We have seen cases where tens of thousands of new wires are 
introduced.  In fact, this transform was one of our initial motivations for 
<a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-P.html">name factories</a>.</p> 
 
<p><b>Context.</b> I usually think of expression splitting as a kind of 
preprocessing step that leads toward <a href="VL2014____OCCFORM.html">occform</a>; occform replaces simple 
assignments (e.g., like those to the temporary wires above) with module 
instances, but can't deal with complex expressions.</p> 
 
<p><b>Prerequisites.</b> We expect that <a href="VL2014____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> has been run and that 
<a href="VL2014____EXPRESSION-SIZING.html">expression-sizing</a> has already been done.  Unsized expressions or named 
arguments will generally lead to fatal <a href="VL2014____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> being added to the 
module.</p> 
 
<p><b>Soundness Concerns.</b> If submodule ports are mislabeled, we might end 
up splitting up an input to a module instance that has backflow.  That is, we 
could do somethign like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">submod foo ( ..., .i(a + b), ...);
  ---&gt;
wire[3:0] tmp = a + b;
submod foo ( ..., .i(tmp), ...);</pre> 
 
<p>And if <span class="v">foo</span> drives <span class="v">i</span>, then we might end up with <span class="v">tmp</span> being X 
sometimes.  Worse would be if the expression was somethign like <span class="v">a ? b :
1'bz</span>, in which case the submodule could actually end up putting out a value 
onto <span class="v">tmp</span>.</p> 
 
<p>I don't really think this is a problem.  I think we're saved because, since 
a new, fresh temporary wire is going to be used, whether or not that temporary 
is driven from both sides isn't really relevant.  It can't be used anywhere 
else in the module or affect anything except for exactly this port.</p>
