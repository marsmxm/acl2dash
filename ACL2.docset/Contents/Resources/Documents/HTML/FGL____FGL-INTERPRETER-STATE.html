<p>Description of FGL's interpreter state object.</p><p>The FGL interpreter state is a stobj containing, as the name suggests, 
essentially the entire state of the FGL interpreter.  We list and describe 
several of the major components of this object.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">stack</span>: a representation of the interpreter stack; see <a href="FGL____FGL-STACK.html">fgl-stack</a>.  This is a nested abstract stobj whose logical representation is a 
<a href="FGL____MAJOR-STACK.html">major-stack</a> object but whose implementation uses arrays for efficiency.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">logicman</span>: a nested stobj containing several subfields geared toward 
Boolean logic: primarily an AIG (see <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a>), an array of <a href="IPASIR____IPASIR.html">ipasir::ipasir</a> incremental SAT solver objects, and the mappings between AIG 
literals and CNF literals for each of the ipasir instances.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">bvar-db</span>: a mapping between Boolean variable indices (AIG primary input 
numbers) and the symbolic objects they represent.  See <a href="FGL____FGL-GETTING-BITS-FROM-OBJECTS.html">fgl-getting-bits-from-objects</a> for a discussion of how and when Boolean 
variables are derived from terms.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">pathcond</span>: a stack of Boolean constraints (AIG literals) representing 
the current path condition.  May or may not be used as a constraint on SAT 
checks.</li> 
 
</ul>
