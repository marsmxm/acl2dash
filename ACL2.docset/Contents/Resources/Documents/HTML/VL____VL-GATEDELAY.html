</dl><p><b>WARNING</b>.  We have not paid much attention to delays, and our 
transformations probably do not handle them properly.</p> 
 
<p>Delays are mainly discussed in 7.14 and 5.3, with some other discussion in 
6.13 and the earlier parts of Section 7.  In short:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>A "delay expression" can be an arbitrary expression.  Of particular note, 
    mintypmax expression such as 1:2:3 mean "the delay is at least 1, usually 
    2, and at most 3."</li> 
 
<li>Up to three delay expressions are associated with each gate.  These are, 
    in order, 
      <ol> 
        <li>a "rise delay",</li> 
        <li>a "fall delay", and</li> 
        <li>for regular gates, a "high impedence" delay; <br> 
            for triregs, a "charge decay time" delay</li> 
      </ol>
</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The parser does not attempt to determine (3) in some cases, so it may be 
left as <span class="v">nil</span>.  Simulators that care about this will need to carefully 
review the rules for correctly computing these delays.</p>
