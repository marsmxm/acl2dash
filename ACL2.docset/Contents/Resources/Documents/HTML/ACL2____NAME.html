 <p>Many different ACL2 entities have names, e.g., functions, macros, 
 variables, constants, packages, theorems, <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>, etc.  Package names 
 are strings.  All other names are symbols and may not be in the 
 <span class="v">"KEYWORD"</span> package.  Moreover, names of functions, macros, constrained 
 functions, and constants, other than those that are predefined, must not be in 
 the ``main Lisp package'' (which is (<span class="v">"LISP"</span> or <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span>, 
 according to whether we are following CLTL1 or CLTL2).  An analogous 
 restriction on variables is given below.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">T</span>, <span class="v">nil</span>, and all names above except those that begin with 
 ampersand (&amp;) are names of variables or constants.  <span class="v">T</span>, <span class="v">nil</span>, and 
 those names beginning and ending with star (*) are constants.  All other such 
 names are variables.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that names that start with ampersand, such as <span class="v">&amp;rest</span>, may be 
 lambda list keywords and are reserved for such use whether or not they are in 
 the CLTL constant <span class="v">lambda-list-keywords</span>.  (See pg 82 of CLTL2.)  That is, 
 these may not be used as variables.  Unlike constants, variables may be in the 
 main Lisp package as long as they are in the original list of imports from 
 that package to ACL2, the list 
 <span class="v">*common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*</span>, and do not belong to a list 
 of symbols that are potentially ``global.''  This latter list is the value of 
 <span class="v">*common-lisp-specials-and-constants*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Our restrictions pertaining to the main Lisp package take into account that 
 some symbols, e.g., <span class="v">lambda-list-keywords</span> and <span class="v">boole-c2</span>, are 
 ``special.''  Permitting them to be bound could have harmful effects.  In 
 addition, the Common Lisp language does not allow certain manipulations with 
 many symbols of that package.  So, we stay away from them, except for allowing 
 certain variables as indicated above.</p>
