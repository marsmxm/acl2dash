<p>Computed hints to prove the execution theorems.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, 
     the main theorems are proved by mutual execution, 
     using the flag approach.</p><p>The current proof uses some <span class="v">:use</span> and <span class="v">:expand</span> hints 
     for certain cases of the induction proof. 
     For robustness and efficiency, 
     we prefer to apply these hints only to those cases. 
     (In earlier version of this proof, which was more complex at the time, 
     attempting to apply these hints to all cases uniformly 
     caused the proof to be too slow, if it worked at all, 
     presumably due to many unnecessary case splits.) 
     There may be actually ways to avoid the <span class="v">:use</span> hints, 
     by proving and enabling suitable rules. 
     It is less clear whether the <span class="v">:expand</span> hints could be avoided, 
     given that the functions in question are already enabled, 
     but ACL2's heuristics prevent their expansion, 
     even though forcing the expand with the <span class="v">:expand</span> hints 
     leads to a successful proof in the end. 
     Perhaps they might be applied uniformly to all subgoals, 
     but this may cause proof brittleness or inefficiency. 
     Thus, limiting these <span class="v">:use</span> and <span class="v">:expand</span> hints to the needed cases 
     seems to be the right thing at this moment.</p><p>We also want to limit the enabling of certain functions 
     to certain cases of the induction proof. 
     We need to study this in more detail, 
     but initial experiments 
     (actually in an earlier, more complex version of this proof) 
     suggested that those enablements 
     may cause adverse effects in the cases in which they are not needed. 
     So, again, limiting the enablements to the needed proof cases 
     seems to be the right thing at this moment.</p><p>To avoid the brittleness and unreadability of subgoal hints, 
     we use computed hints to robustly and readably designate 
     the proof cases to which specific hints must apply. 
     We do that with the function below, 
     which uses two macros for conciseness. 
     The proof cases are denoted based on 
     the flag value and possibly the kind of statement; 
     these are expressed in terms of occurrences of terms in the clauses.</p>
