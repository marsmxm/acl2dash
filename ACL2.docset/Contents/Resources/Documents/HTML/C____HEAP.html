<p>Fixtype of heaps.</p><p>The heap is the memory area manipulated by <span class="v">malloc</span> and <span class="v">free</span>. 
     [C] does not actually use the term `heap'; 
     in fact, [C] does not appear to use a specific term for this memory area. 
     However, `heap' is sufficiently commonly used 
     that it seems adequate to use it here.</p><p>For now we model the heap just as a finite map from addresses to values.</p>
