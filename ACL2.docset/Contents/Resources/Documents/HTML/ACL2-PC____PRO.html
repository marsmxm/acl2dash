<p>(atomic macro) 
repeatedly apply promote</p><pre class="code">Example and General Form:
pro</pre> 
 
 <p>Apply the <span class="v">promote</span> command until there is no change.  This command 
 ``succeeds'' exactly when at least one call of <span class="v">promote</span> ``succeeds''.  In 
 that case, only a single new proof-builder state will be created.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: The <span class="v">split</span> command is probably more helpful in many cases than 
 <span class="v">pro</span>.</p>
