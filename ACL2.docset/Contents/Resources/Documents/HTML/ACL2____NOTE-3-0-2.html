<p>ACL2 Version  3.0.2 (December, 2006) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the 
 documentation has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed soundness bugs in the handling of primitive function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PKG-WITNESS.html">pkg-witness</a></span>, and improved its documentation.  (The executable counterpart 
 returned an incorrect default value, and the axiom 
 <span class="v">symbol-package-name-pkg-witness-name</span> needed <span class="v">pkg-name</span> to be other 
 than <span class="v">""</span> in order to avoid the default value of "ACL2".)  As fallout, 
 a new built-in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> rule, 
 <span class="v">symbol-package-name-of-symbol-is-not-empty-string</span>, now asserts that the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> of a symbol is never <span class="v">""</span>.  Thanks to Mike 
 Gordon for bringing these soundness bugs to our attention by attempting to 
 prove translations of ACL2 axioms in HOL4.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a soundness bug in linear arithmetic, due to incomplete tracking of 
 forced assumptions while deriving inequalities.  Thanks to Robert Krug for 
 providing a fix and a proof of <span class="v">nil</span> before the fix.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a soundness bug in the redundancy criterion for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> events, 
 which has been modified; see <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>.  This bug is illustrated 
 below.  Thanks to Peter Dillinger and Jared Davis for contributions to an 
 email thread that led us to discover this bug.  The solution is that for a 
 definition to be redundant with an earlier definition, ACL2 no longer ignores 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEASURE.html">measure</a></span> <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> except when skipping proofs (e.g., during 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>).  However, a new ``measure'', <span class="v">(:? v1 ... vk)</span>, is 
 supported, for specifying a measured subset of the set of formals, i.e., a set 
 of formals that serves as the set of parameters for some valid measure.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 ()

 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x y)
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :measure (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> y)))
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> y))
              (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> y))
            y)))

; So the following is redundant -- but it guesses a measure
; of (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> x), which isn't right!
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x y)
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> y))
       (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> y))
     y)))

; end of encapsulate

; Now we prove a non-theorem by exploiting the bug above,
; erroneously replacing formal y by a constant in the induction
; scheme hinted below.  (This should not be allowed, as y should be
; labeled as a measured formal.)

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bad
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> x)
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints (("Goal" :induct (foo x '(3)))))

; It's easy to get a contradiction by instantiating the
; non-theorem just above.
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> contradiction
  nil
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints (("Goal" :use ((:instance bad (x '(7)))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span> and the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>'s 
 <span class="v">show-rewrites</span> (<span class="v">sr</span>) command that was causing a Lisp break.  For 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span>, also improved the display of unifying substitutions, 
 modified output to take binding hypotheses <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> var term)</span> into account 
 properly, and arranged for inclusion of <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> rules that modify the 
 given term.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing these issues to our 
 attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Introduced new utilities for undoing <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBU.html">ubu</a></span> and 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBU_12.html">ubu!</a></span>, which are analogous to <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT_12.html">ubt!</a></span>  (respectively) except that they only undo back up to, but not 
 including, the indicated command.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a performance bug, pointed out by Eric Smith, that was negating 
 efforts made for the preceding release to avoid computation for disabled 
 warnings.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span> and <span class="v">value-triple</span> to <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>.  Thanks 
 to Bob Boyer and Erik Reeber (respectively) for bringing these issues to our 
 attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the automatic proclaiming of function types for GCL and OpenMCL, 
 specifically to use an output format consistent with the Common Lisp spec. 
 Thanks to Bob Boyer for bringing this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <span class="v">books/misc/transfinite.lisp</span>, which deals with transfinite 
 induction in ACL2.  Thanks to Eric Smith for contributing this book.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <span class="v">books/misc/process-book-readme.lisp</span> to the distribution.  Thanks 
 to Sandip Ray for pointing out its omission.</p> 
 
 <p>Added contributions <span class="v">books/concurrent-programs/bakery/</span> and 
 <span class="v">books/concurrent-programs/german-protocol/</span>.  These contributions can be 
 used as tutorials, especially by new ACL2 users, for learning how to model 
 concurrent protocols in ACL2 and the steps involved in reasoning about their 
 correctness.  Thanks to Sandip Ray for these contributions.  See the 
 <span class="v">Readme.lsp</span> files in these directories.</p> 
 
 <p>Theory invariants may now involve the variable <span class="v">ENS</span> instead of the 
 variable <span class="v">THEORY</span>.  The practical effect of this change is that any 
 expression of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">MEMBER-EQUAL</a> rune THEORY)</span> occurring in a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></span> expression should be replaced by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACTIVE-RUNEP.html">ACTIVE-RUNEP</a> rune)</span>. 
 See <a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a>.  Thanks to Eric Smith and Dave Greve for pointing 
 out an inefficiency in the handling of theory invariants that led to this 
 change, which can speed up their handling by orders of magnitude on large 
 examples, and to Eric for testing this change and pointing out problems with 
 an early implementation of it.</p> 
 
 <p>Theory invariants (see <a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a>) are no longer checked on 
 theories defined by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  After all, one can 
 define a theory with <span class="v">deftheory</span> that is not intended to be used as the 
 current theory, but rather is intended to be combined with other <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a> (see <a href="ACL2____THEORY-FUNCTIONS.html">theory-functions</a>).  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing 
 this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">Theory-invariant</a></span> errors had been reported with very little detail 
 when warnings were inhibited.  This problem has been fixed; thanks to Eric 
 Smith for bringing it to our attention and providing an example.  We have also 
 improved the handling of redundancy for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> now has a new optional keyword, <span class="v">rewrite</span>, 
 that can be used to change the form of the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule 
 generated when the quantifier is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a></span>.  Thanks to Eric Smith and 
 Sandip Ray for useful discussions on this topic.  We have also slightly 
 modified the <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> for the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event underneath a 
 <span class="v">defun-sk</span> in order to make the proof more reliably efficient.</p> 
 
 <p>A new event, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a></span>, allows setting of a barrier before 
 which undoing is illegal.  An argument to this macro allows the barrier to be 
 made permanent; otherwise, it can be removed with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT-PREHISTORY.html">ubt-prehistory</a></span>.  Thanks to Peter Dillinger for useful conversations leading 
 to the addition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new query, <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-P.html">wormhole-p</a></span><span class="v"> </span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span><span class="v">)</span>, allows 
 users to determine whether or not they are in a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a></span>.  Thanks to 
 Peter Dillinger for providing this utility.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Value-triple</span> no longer evaluates its form during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, 
 and in raw Lisp its calls trivially macroexpand to <span class="v">nil</span>, without any 
 consideration of its argument.  This change avoids errors and warnings when 
 <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> names occur in the argument.</p> 
 
 <p>We fixed what could be considered a soundness hole that could occur by 
 exploiting redefinition in a particular way.  Thanks to Peter Dillinger for 
 raising a question that led to discovery of this hole.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug has been fixed in handling of illegal <a href="ACL2____THEORY.html">theory</a> expressions. 
 Thanks to Eric Smith, who reported this problem and provided the example 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> '((:definition natp) (:rewrite doesntexist)))</span> to show how a 
 hard error could occur.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved error reporting by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> when the certification 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> contains inadmissible forms.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> to add two new keyword arguments.  There is now 
 a <span class="v">:doc</span> keyword argument; previously, an optional documentation string 
 (see <span class="v">doc-string</span>) was to be placed just before the body, without a 
 keyword.  There is also a <span class="v">:strengthen</span> argument that strengthens the axiom 
 added, which allows for the definition of ``fixing'' functions for equivalence 
 relations that choose canonical representatives of equivalence classes.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>.  Thanks for Dave Greve for useful discussions that led us to 
 this <span class="v">:strengthen</span> enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <span class="v">books/misc/bash.lisp</span>, which provides utilities for simplifying a 
 goal into a list of subgoals (as documented at the top of that file).  Thanks 
 to Dave Greve for requesting this utility and suggesting refinements to its 
 functionality, which have been incorporated.</p> 
 
 <p>(For Emacs users only) The command <span class="v">meta-x new-shell</span> provided by file 
 <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> now puts you in shell-mode, which for example 
 supports directory tracking.  Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting this 
 change.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed some mishandling of <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> 
 expansion.</p> 
 
 <p>Introduced a new event, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></span>, that introduces a ``trust tag'' 
 (``ttag'') allowing for extensions of ACL2 and for the use of generally unsafe 
 ACL2 constructs.  Thanks to Peter Dillinger, Sandip Ray, and Erik Reeber for 
 useful discussions on <span class="v">defttag</span> and the following related items.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>A new event, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-UNTOUCHABLE.html">remove-untouchable</a></span>, can be used to give users access 
 to system functions and data structures.  We also fixed a bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a></span>; and, it no longer is a no-op in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode. 
 Thanks to Peter Dillinger for proposing <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-UNTOUCHABLE.html">remove-untouchable</a></span> and 
 suggesting that it and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a></span> be functional in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode.</p> 
 
 <p>Raw-mode (see <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a>) no longer disables <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>. 
 However, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a></span> is now disallowed unless there is an active ttag 
 (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>).  If you want to execute <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a></span><span class="v">
 t)</span> and there is no active ttag, consider executing <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE-ON_12.html">set-raw-mode-on!</a></span><span class="v">)</span> instead.</p> 
 
 <p>Redefinition of system functions is disallowed unless there is an active 
 ttag.  However, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REDEF_12.html">redef!</a></span> now introduces <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> :redef!)</span> in order 
 to allow redefinition of system functions.</p> 
 
 <p>A new event, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_12.html">progn!</a></span>, is a legal embedded event form that can go in 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> and both <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> forms (see <a href="ACL2____EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>), and is similar to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> except that it allows 
 arbitrary forms.  Thus, a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_12.html">progn!</a></span> form is potentially dangerous and can 
 only be evaluated if there is an active ttag.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____TTAGS-SEEN.html">ttags-seen</a> for information about how to find the ttags known in 
 the current ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, and for related caveats.</p> 
 
 <p>A new book created with Peter Dillinger, <span class="v">books/misc/hacker.lisp</span> (added 
 after Version_3.3: now <span class="v">books/hacking/hacker.lisp</span>), uses <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_12.html">progn!</a></span> to 
 define utilities <span class="v">with-raw-mode</span> and <span class="v">with-redef-allowed</span>, which 
 respectively allow raw Lisp evaluation and redefinition to take place within a 
 certifiable book (!).</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>Macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a></span> is no longer allowed in function bodies because 
 it does not have (and has never had) any effect in raw Lisp.  See <a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> for a workaround.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in redundancy of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> in raw Lisp, which caused an 
 error when certifying a book with a redundant <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> event whose 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span> had already been modified.  Here is an example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st fld)
(update-fld 3 st)
(<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> "foo" 1) ; where foo.lisp contains (<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st fld)</pre> 
 
 <p>New books illustrating <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> have been contributed in 
 directory <span class="v">books/make-event/</span>: <span class="v">dotimes.lisp</span> (David Rager), 
 <span class="v">stobj-test.lisp</span>, and <span class="v">logical-tangent.lisp</span> (Peter Dillinger).</p> 
 
 <p>Modified <span class="v">print-object$</span> (see <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a>) so that it no longer prints an 
 extra space at the end.</p> 
 
 <p>Replaced the ``draconian restriction to avoid capture'' that had prevented 
 some <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> from being legal.  The 
 corresponding check now only requires that no variable free in the functional 
 substitution is captured by a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> (or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span>) binding.  See <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added new extended metafunction, <span class="v">mfc-rw+</span>, which is equivalent to 
 <span class="v">mfc-rw</span> except that it takes an alist argument, which may be useful for 
 efficiency.  See <a href="ACL2____EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>.  Thanks to Robert Krug for 
 suggesting this more efficient variant of <span class="v">mfc-rw</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added support for the <span class="v">ignorable</span> <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> form.</p> 
 
 <p>We now cause an error on a call of <span class="v">open-input-channel</span> (see <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a>) 
 with an argument string whose first character is the <span class="v">|</span> character.  Thanks 
 to Bob Boyer for providing an example (several months ago) showing the danger 
 of such calls, namely that the following command would log you out and kill 
 all of your processes when running on top of GCL in Linux:<br> 
 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____OPEN-INPUT-CHANNEL.html">open-input-channel</a> "|kill -9 -1" :object state)</span></p> 
 
 <p>Restricted the use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> to contexts in which it can be 
 tracked properly, under legal <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> (see <a href="ACL2____EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>). 
 Thanks to Peter Dillinger for bringing an example to our attention that led to 
 this fix.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was avoiding <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-checking for the functions 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPRESS1.html">compress1</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPRESS2.html">compress2</a></span>.  Thanks to David Rager for bringing 
 this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Added an error message when a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> 
 event fails, to clarify whether failure is for the <a href="ACL2____MEASURE.html">measure</a> conjecture 
 or for the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> conjecture.  Thanks to David Rager for requesting 
 clarification for such failures.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in reporting of <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> violations (hard Lisp error) when 
 certain macros (for example, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a></span>) are used in the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>. 
 Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing this problem to our attention and providing 
 assistance with the solution, in particular by providing a helpful 
 example.</p> 
 
 <p>Grant Passmore has contributed a resolution/paramodulation prover written 
 in ACL2, in directory <span class="v">books/deduction/passmore/</span>.  Thanks, Grant.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the error message when illegal theories are encountered.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the suppression of output for <span class="v">inhibit-output</span> arguments of 
 routines in the book <span class="v">books/misc/expander.lisp</span>.  Thanks to Qiang Zhang for 
 pointing out the possibility for improvement here.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a new directory <span class="v">books/arithmetic-3/extra/</span> that extends 
 <span class="v">books/arithmetic-3</span> with additional rules, contributed by Alex Spiridonov 
 with guidance from Robert Krug.  WARNING: This directory is under development. 
 It may undergo large changes in future releases, so please consider it 
 experimental and subject to change.  Feedback is welcomed.</p> 
 
 <p>As part of the work mentioned just above, Robert Krug and Alex Spiridonov 
 contributed improvements to <span class="v">books/arithmetic-3/</span>:</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>o A new rule <span class="v">|(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____F2.html">/</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____F2.html">/</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> x n)))|</span> in 
 <span class="v">bind-free/collect.lisp</span>, which is important for reducing <span class="v">collect-*</span> 
 expressions though it slowed down one proof (see comment above this rule in 
 <span class="v">bind-free/collect.lisp</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>o Slight improvements of rules <span class="v">integerp-mod</span> and <span class="v">rationalp-mod</span> in 
 <span class="v">floor-mod/floor-mod.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>o To avoid conflict with <span class="v">books/rtl/rel6/arithmetic/</span>, renamed rule 
 <span class="v">mod-minus</span> to <span class="v">mod-neg</span> in <span class="v">floor-mod/floor-mod.lisp</span>, and renamed 
 <span class="v">integerp-+-reduce-leading-constant</span> to 
 <span class="v">integerp-+-reduce-leading-rational-constant</span> in 
 <span class="v">bind-free/integerp.lisp</span>.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>(GCL on Windows only) Made a low-level change to avoid multiplying stacks 
 for GCL on Windows, since GCL 2.6.6 broke while doing this.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed bugs in linear arithmetic (rarely evidenced, it seems) involving 
 using <span class="v">&lt;</span> to compare complex rational constants.  Thanks to Robert Krug for 
 helping with the fixes.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a new event, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSERT-EVENT.html">assert-event</a></span>, for checking that forms evaluate 
 to non-<span class="v">nil</span> values.  Thanks to Peter Dillinger for suggesting and 
 collaborating on this addition.</p>
