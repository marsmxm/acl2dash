<p>Naive compiler from Hons AIGs into C/C++ code fragments.</p><p>The idea here is to be able to take an AIG and embed it in a C or 
C++ program.  You can tweak various aspects of the code that gets generated, 
but some basic example output is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">const uint32_t n_8 = inputs.a;     // prologue: initializes temp variables
const uint32_t n_2 = inputs.b;     //   you can control the rhs'es here
const uint32_t n_4 = inputs.c;

const uint32_t n_3 = ~n_4;         // main aig contents
const uint32_t n_1 = n_2 &amp; n_3;    //   never try to understand this
const uint32_t n_7 = ~n_8;
const uint32_t n_6 = n_4 &amp; n_7;
const uint32_t n_5 = n_6 &amp; n_1;

out1 = n_1;                        // epilogue: extracts aigs to outputs
out2 = n_5;                        //   you can control the lhs'es here</pre> 
 
<p>We try to make relatively few assumptions about how you might actually use 
this code.  Toward that goal, you may <a href="ACL2____AIG2C-CONFIG-P.html">configure</a>, e.g., the names and types of the temporary 
variables, and the operators used to carry out each AND and NOT operation.</p> 
 
<p>Some high level notes:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We basically turn each AIG node into one line of C/C++ code.</li> 
 
<li>We do at least take advantage of shared structure in the AIG, and avoid 
recomputing an AND node just because it has multiple fanouts.</li> 
 
<li>We don't even do basic optimizations like using <span class="v">|</span> or <span class="v">^</span> operators, 
but doing so might be useful.</li> 
 
<li>We do nothing to smartly collapse the AIG into vectors to take advantage 
of, e.g., 32-bit bitwise ANDs, or anything like that.</li> 
 
</ul>
