<p>Fixtype of lengths of integer constants [C:6.4.4.1].</p><p>This is a tagged union type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">fty::deftagsum</a>.</p>

<p>An integer constant may have 
     (i) an <span class="v">l</span> or <span class="v">L</span> suffix, 
     or (ii) an <span class="v">ll</span> or <span class="v">LL</span> suffix, 
     or (iii) no such suffix. 
     This fixtype captures these three possibilities, 
     without distinguishing between the lowercase and uppercase variants 
     (given the similarity between `l' and `1' and `I' in many fonts, 
     it could be argued that one should always use the uppercase variants, 
     as recommended in the Java language specification for Java).</p><p>Since the grammar in [C] refers to these as <i>long-suffix</i>, 
     it seems appropriate to call these the `length' of an integer constant, 
     which justifies the name of this fixtype.</p>
