<p>Automatically generated usage message.</p><pre class="code">    -h,--help             Show a brief usage message and exit. 
--readme              Show a more elaborate README and exit. 
-o,--output=FILE      Write output to FILE.  Default: "foo.v.json", 
                      where "foo.v" is the basename of the first 
                      Verilog file provided. 
-s,--search=DIR       Control the search path for finding modules. 
                      You can give this switch multiple times, to 
                      set up multiple search paths in priority 
                      order. 
-I,--incdir=DIR       Control the list of directories for `include 
                      files.  You can give this switch multiple 
                      times.  By default, we look only in the 
                      current directory. 
--searchext=EXT       Control the search extensions for finding 
                      modules.  You can give this switch multiple 
                      times.  By default we just look for files 
                      named "foo.sv" and "foo.v" in the --search 
                      directories.  If you have Verilog files with 
                      different extensions, this won't work, so you 
                      can add these extensions here. 
-D,--define=VAR       Set up definitions to use before parsing 
                      begins.  For instance, "--define foo" is 
                      similar to "`define foo" and "--define foo=3" 
                      is similar to "`define foo 3".  Note: these 
                      defines are "sticky" and will override 
                      subsequent `defines in your Verilog files 
                      unless your Verilog explicitly uses `undef. 
                      You can give this option multiple times. 
--edition=EDITION     Which edition of the Verilog standard to 
                      implement?  Default: "SystemVerilog" (IEEE 
                      1800-2012).  You can alternately use 
                      "Verilog" for IEEE 1364-2005, i.e., 
                      Verilog-2005. 
--strict              Disable VL extensions to Verilog. 
-m,--mem=GB           How much memory to try to use.  Default: 4 
                      GB.  Raising this may improve performance by 
                      avoiding garbage collection.  To avoid 
                      swapping, keep this below (physical_memory - 
                      2 GB).
