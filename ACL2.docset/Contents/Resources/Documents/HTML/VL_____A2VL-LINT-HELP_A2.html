<p>Usage message for vl lint.</p><p><b>Value:</b></p><pre class="code">"
vl lint:  A linting tool for Verilog.  Scans your Verilog files for things
          that look like bugs (size mismatches, unused wires, etc.)

Example:  vl lint engine.v wrapper.v core.v \\
            --search ./simlibs \\
            --search ./baselibs

Usage:    vl lint [OPTIONS] file.v [file2.v ...] [+mymode ...]

Options:

    -h,--help             Show a brief usage message and exit.
    --readme              Show a more elaborate README and exit.
    -s,--search=DIR       Control the search path for finding modules.
                          You can give this switch multiple times, to
                          set up multiple search paths in priority
                          order.
    --searchext=EXT       Control the search extensions for finding
                          modules.  You can give this switch multiple
                          times.  By default we just look for files
                          named \"foo.v\" in the --search directories.
                          But if you have Verilog files with different
                          extensions, this won't work, so you can add
                          these extensions here.  EXT should not
                          include the period, e.g., use \"--searchext
                          vv\" to consider files like \"foo.vv\", etc.
    -I,--incdir=DIR       Control the list of directories for `include
                          files.  You can give this switch multiple
                          times.  By default, we look only in the
                          current directory.
    --topmod=MOD          Limit the scope of the report to MOD.  By
                          default we include all warnings for any
                          module we encounter.  But if you say
                          \"--topmod foo\", we suppress all warnings for
                          modules that foo does not depend on.  You can
                          give this switch multiple times, e.g.,
                          \"--topmod foo --topmod bar\" means: only show
                          warnings for foo, bar, and modules that they
                          depend on.
    -q,--quiet=MOD        Suppress all warnings that about MOD.  You
                          can give this switch multiple times, e.g.,
                          \"-q foo -q bar\" will hide the warnings about
                          modules foo and bar.
    -d,--drop=MOD         Delete MOD from the module hierarchy before
                          doing any linting at all.  This is a gross
                          (but effective) way to work through any bugs
                          in the linter that are triggered by certain
                          modules.  The dropped modules are removed
                          from the module list without destroying
                          modules above them.  This may occasionally
                          lead to false warnings about the modules
                          above (e.g., it may think some wires are
                          unused, because the module that uses them has
                          been removed.)
    -i,--ignore=TYPE      Ignore warnings of this TYPE.  For instance,
                          \"--ignore oddexpr\" will suppress
                          VL_WARN_ODDEXPR warnings.  Note that there
                          are much finer-grained ways to suppress
                          warnings; see \"vl lint --readme\" for more
                          information.
    --ignore-file=FILENAME
                          Ignore warnings from modules in filename.
                          For instance, \"--ignore-file foo.v\" will
                          suppress all warnings from modules in foo.v
                          (from any directory).  You can also give
                          absolute paths, in which case only exact
                          matches will be suppressed.  Note that there
                          are much finer-grained ways to suppress
                          warnings; see \"vl lint --readme\" for more
                          information.
    -D,--define=VAR       Set up definitions to use before parsing
                          begins.  For instance, \"--define foo\" is
                          similar to \"`define foo\" and \"--define foo=3\"
                          is similar to \"`define foo 3\".  Note: these
                          defines are \"sticky\" and will override
                          subsequent `defines in your Verilog files
                          unless your Verilog explicitly uses `undef.
                          You can give this option multiple times.
    --cclimit=N           Limit for the const check.  This is a beta
                          feature that is not yet released.  Setting N
                          to 0 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a> default) disables the check.
                          Otherwise, limit the scope of the check to at
                          most N sub-expressions.
    --global-package=PACKAGE
                          Consider the given package to be global for
                          purposes of the globalparams check; i.e.,
                          parameters defined in this package should not
                          be defined anywhere else.
    --elab-limit=N        Default 10000.  Recursion limit for
                          elaboration.  This usually shouldn't matter
                          or need tinkering.  It's a safety valve
                          against possible loops in elaboration, e.g.,
                          to resolve parameter P you need to evaluate
                          parameter Q, which might require you to
                          resolve R, which might depend hierarchically
                          on P, and so on.  So if you hit this there's
                          probably something wrong with your design.
    --stmt-limit=N        Default 80.  Recursion limit for compiling
                          statements, e.g., unrolling loops and
                          figuring out when they terminate.  For
                          linting we use a low default limit that is
                          meant to avoid wasting an inordinate amount
                          of time compiling troublesome loops.
                          Increasing this may avoid svex translation
                          warnings, but may result in bad performance
                          in some cases.
    --no-typo             Disable typo detection (it is sometimes
                          slow).
    --no-html             Reduce the file size of vl-warnings.json by
                          printing the warnings there in text-only
                          mode.
    --no-sv-use-set       Disable sv-use-set check.
    --edition=EDITION     Which edition of the Verilog standard to
                          implement?  Default: \"SystemVerilog\" (IEEE
                          1800-2012).  You can alternately use
                          \"Verilog\" for IEEE 1364-2005, i.e.,
                          Verilog-2005.
    --strict              Disable VL extensions to Verilog.
    -m,--mem=GB           How much memory to try to use.  Default: 4
                          GB.  Raising this may improve performance by
                          avoiding garbage collection.  To avoid
                          swapping, keep this below (physical_memory -
                          2 GB).
    --debug               Print extra information for debugging.
    --shell               Instead of running the linter, enter an ACL2
                          shell where the linter configuration has been
                          saved as constant
                          @('vl::*vl-user-lintconfig*').
    --post-shell          After running the linter, enter an ACL2 shell
                          where the linter configuration has been saved
                          as constant @('vl::*vl-user-lintconfig*').
