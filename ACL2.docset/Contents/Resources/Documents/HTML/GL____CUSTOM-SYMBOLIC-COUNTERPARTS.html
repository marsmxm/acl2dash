<p>The advanced GL user can write custom symbolic counterparts to get better 
performance.</p> 
 
<p>This is somewhat involved.  Generally, such a function operates by cases on 
what kinds of symbolic objects it has been given.  Most of these cases are 
easy; for instance, the symbolic counterpart for <a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> just returns 
<span class="v">nil</span> when given a <span class="v">:g-boolean</span> or <span class="v">:g-integer</span>.  But in other cases 
the operation can require combining the Boolean expressions making up the 
arguments in some way, e.g., the symbolic counterpart for <a href="ACL2____BINARY-_A2.html">binary-*</a> 
implements a simple binary multiplier.</p> 
 
<p>Once the counterpart has been defined, it must be proven sound with respect 
to the semantics of ACL2 and the symbolic object format.  This is an ordinary 
ACL2 proof effort that requires some understanding of GL's implementation.</p> 
 
<p>An example of a more sophisticated symbolic counterpart is an <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">aig</a> to 
<a href="ACL2____UBDDS.html">ubdd</a> conversion algorithm.  This function 
serves as a symbolic counterpart for AIG evaluation.  This algorithm and its 
correctness proof can be found in the book <span class="v">centaur/aig/g-aig-eval</span>.</p>
