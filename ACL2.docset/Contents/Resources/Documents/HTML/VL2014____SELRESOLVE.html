<p>Simplification of select expressions, e.g., <span class="v">mywire[3-1]</span>.</p><p>It is sometimes useful to statically evaluate indexes into wires 
and registers, particularly to deal with the results of <a href="VL2014____UNPARAMETERIZATION.html">unparameterization</a>.  For instance,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire a_msb = abus[width-1];</pre> 
 
<p>May have been converted into something like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire a_msb = abus[6-1];</pre> 
 
<p>And in this case it is much nicer to statically resolve this and know that 
we are talking about bit <span class="v">5</span> rather than to treat it as a dynamic bit 
select.  It is also here that we deal with resolving multiplicities on 
replication (multiple concatenation) operations.</p>
