<p>Prove a theorem using FGL with case-splitting.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">Def-fgl-param-thm</span> is similar to <a href="FGL____DEF-FGL-THM.html">def-fgl-thm</a>, but runs a clause 
processor prior to FGL that splits the goal into several cases based on the 
provided arguments.  It somewhat replicates the behavior of <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-PARAM-THM.html">ACL2::def-gl-param-thm</a>, but ignores the shape specifiers provided for the 
various cases.</p> 
 
<p>The usage of <span class="v">def-fgl-param-thm</span> is similar to that of <a href="FGL____DEF-FGL-THM.html">def-fgl-thm</a>, but it accepts several more keyword arguments:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:param-bindings</span> is the same as in <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-PARAM-THM.html">ACL2::def-gl-param-thm</a>, but 
the shape specifier alist in each entry is ignored.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:param-hyp</span> is the same as in <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-PARAM-THM.html">ACL2::def-gl-param-thm</a>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:split-params</span> provides the <a href="FGL____FGL-SAT-CHECK.html">fgl-sat-check</a> parameters object for 
proving that case split provided covers all cases.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:solve-params</span> provides the <a href="FGL____FGL-SAT-CHECK.html">fgl-sat-check</a> object for proving each case.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:repeat-concl-p</span> controls whether the conclusion is (if nil) 
rewritten/symbolically executed once and then solved separately for each case, 
or (if nonnil) rewritten/symbolically executed (and also solved) separately for 
each case.</li> 
 
</ul>
