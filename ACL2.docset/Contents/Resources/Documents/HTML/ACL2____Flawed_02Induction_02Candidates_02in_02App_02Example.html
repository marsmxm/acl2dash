<p>Flawed Induction Candidates in App Example</p><p>Induction on <b>a</b> is unflawed: every occurrence of <b>a</b> in 
 the conjecture</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(equal (app (app <b>a</b> b) c) 
       (app <b>a</b> (app b c))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>is in a position being recursively decomposed!</p> 
 
 <p>Now look at the occurrences of <span class="v">b</span>.  The first (shown in <b>bold</b> 
 below) is in a position that is held constant in the recursion of <span class="v">(app a
 b)</span>.  It would be ``bad'' to induct on <span class="v">b</span> here.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(equal (app (app a <b>b</b>) c) 
       (app a (app b c)))
