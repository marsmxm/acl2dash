<p>Tools for debugging FGL failures</p> 
<p>In this topic we list some techniques for debugging FGL failures.</p> 
 
<h3>Examining the Stack</h3> 
 
<p>FGL keeps almost all of the state of its interpreter inside its interpreter 
state stobj <span class="v">interp-st</span>.  In particular, it keeps a stack containing 
variable bindings, scratch objects, and debugging information inside this 
stobj. Examining this stack to see where FGL ran into an error or where it's 
spending time is one of the best tools for debugging FGL problems.</p> 
 
<p>The stack is contained in a nested stobj inside the interpreter state, but 
it can be dumped into a regular ACL2 object using the function 
<span class="v">(fgl::interp-st-extract-stack fgl::interp-st)</span>.  Usually when FGL encounters an error it will also save the stack into a state global <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> :fgl-interp-error-debug-stack)</span>.  The FGL clause 
processor is typically run on the live interp-st stobj, so if the clause processor is 
interrupted during a proof the stack can be retrieved from that stobj, either afterward 
from the ACL2 loop or within the raw Lisp break:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">;; From within the ACL2 loop, save the stack into a constant (using std/util/defconsts.lisp):
(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a> *my-stack* (fgl::interp-st-extract-stack fgl::interp-st))
;; Or put it in a state global, accessed as (<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> :my-stack):
(<a href="ACL2____F-PUT-GLOBAL.html">f-put-global</a> ':my-stack (fgl::interp-st-extract-stack fgl::interp-st) state)

;; From within a raw Lisp break, save the stack as a defparameter:
(defparameter *my-stack* (fgl::interp-st-extract-stack (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ASSOC.html">assoc</a> 'fgl::interp-st *user-stobj-alist*)))</pre> 
 
<p>Note: be sure NOT to do the latter when in a raw Lisp break resulting from a 
stack overflow! It may cause your Lisp to crash completely.</p> 
 
<p>The stack object's type is <a href="FGL____MAJOR-STACK.html">major-stack</a>, which is documented under 
<a href="FGL____FGL-STACK.html">fgl-stack</a>.  Essentially it is a nonempty list of <a href="FGL____MAJOR-FRAME.html">major-frame</a> 
objects representing scopes such as function calls and rewrite rules.  Each 
frame contains some variable bindings and debug info identifying what rule 
application that frame represents, as well as a minor stack representing a 
nesting of lambdas.</p> 
 
<p>A useful tool for examining a stack object is 
<span class="v">(fgl::major-stack-&gt;debugframes my-stack)</span>, which returns the debug info 
from each of the major frames paired with its index.  Often you can find the 
frames you're most interested in by looking at the debug info, and then examine 
those frames closer by indexing into the stack with <span class="v">nth</span> etc.</p> 
 
<p>It may be useful to set a lower recursion limit for the FGL interpreter. 
The default is 10000, but it may help to catch runaway rule applications to 
limit it to 1000 or less.  This can be adjusted by setting the state global 
<span class="v">:fgl-reclimit</span>.</p> 
 
<h3>Tracing Rewrite Rules</h3> 
 
<p>Most of the work of FGL is done by rewrite rules -- even the expansion of 
function definitions is just treated as an application of a rewrite rule. 
Tracing rewrites can help debug problems due to rule applications unexpectedly 
failing or recurring out of control, etc.  See <a href="FGL____FGL-REWRITE-TRACING.html">fgl-rewrite-tracing</a>.</p> 
 
<h3>Profiling</h3> 
 
<p>FGL provides <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated 
persistence</a>-style profiling of rewrite rules, concrete executions, and 
FGL primitive executions.  These may help debug performance problems by showing 
which rules are invoked many times and which rules cause other rules to be 
invoked many times.  As with ACL2's accumulated persistence, we count two 
numbers for each rule: tries, which simply measures the number of times the 
rule is attempted, and frames, which measures how many tries total, including 
other rules, happen during a top-level attempted application of the rule.</p>
