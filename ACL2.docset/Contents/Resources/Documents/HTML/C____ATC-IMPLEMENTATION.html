<p>Implementation of <span class="tt"><a href="C____ATC.html">atc</a></span>.</p><p>The implementation functions have arguments, 
                        as well as results (in the <a href="STD____RETURNS-SPECIFIERS.html"><span class="v">:returns</span> specifiers</a>), consistently named as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="v">state</span> is the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">wrld</span> is the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">ctx</span> is the <a href="ACL2____CTX.html">context</a> used for errors.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">fn1...fnp</span> is the list <span class="v">(fn1 ... fnp)</span> of inputs to <span class="tt"><a href="C____ATC.html">atc</a></span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">fn</span> is one of the symbols in <span class="v">fn1...fnp</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">fns</span> is <span class="v">fn1...fnp</span> or a suffix of it.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">inscope</span> is a list of alists from ACL2 variable symbols to C types. 
   These are the variables in scope 
   for the ACL2 term whose code is being generated, 
   organized in nested scopes from innermost to outermost. 
   This is like a symbol table for ACL2's representation of the C code.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">prec-fns</span> is an alist from ACL2 function symbols to function information. 
   The function symbols are the ones in <span class="v">fn1...fnp</span> that precede, 
   in the latter list, 
   the symbol <span class="v">fn</span> in <span class="v">fn1...fnp</span> for which code is being generated; 
   <span class="v">fn</span> is often also a parameter of 
   the ATC function that has <span class="v">prec-fns</span> as parameter. 
   According to the restrictions stated in the ATC user documentation, 
   <span class="v">prec-fns</span> consists of (information about) the target function symbols 
   that <span class="v">fn</span> is allowed to call.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">output-file</span> is the homonymous input to the event macro.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">proofs</span> is the homonymous input to the event macro.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">const-name</span> is the homonymous input to the event macro.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">print</span> is the homonymous input to the event macro.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">call</span> is the call of the event macro.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">fn-appconds</span> is an alist 
   from the recursive functions among <span class="v">fn1</span>, ..., <span class="v">fnp</span> 
   to the names (keywords) of the corresponding applicability conditions.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">prog-const</span> is the symbol specified by <span class="v">const-name</span>. 
   This is <span class="v">nil</span> if <span class="v">proofs</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">wf-thm</span> is the name of the generated program well-formedness theorem. 
   This is <span class="v">nil</span> if <span class="v">proofs</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">fn-thms</span> is an alist from <span class="v">fn1</span>, ..., <span class="v">fnp</span> 
   to the names of the generated respective correctness theorems. 
   This is <span class="v">nil</span> if <span class="v">proofs</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">typed-formals</span> is an alist 
   from the formal parameters of one of <span class="v">fn1</span>, ..., <span class="v">fnp</span> 
   to their C types. 
   The keys are unique and in the same order as the formal parameters.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">names-to-avoid</span> is a cumulative list of names of generated events, 
     used to ensure the absence of name clashes in the generated events.</li>
</ul><p>Implementation functions' arguments and results 
                        that are not listed above 
                        are described in, or clear from, 
                        those functions' documentation.</p>
