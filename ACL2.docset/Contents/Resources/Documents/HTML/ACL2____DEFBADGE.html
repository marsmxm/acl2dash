<p>Issue a badge for a function so <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> can evaluate with it</p><p>It is best to be somewhat familiar with the documentation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> before reading this topic.</p> 
 
  <p>Before using <span class="v">defbadge</span> or a utility like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a></span> that relies on 
  it:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "projects/apply/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
  <h3>Badges versus Warrants</h3> 
 
  <p>It is easy to confuse badges, which are issued by <span class="v">defbadge</span>, with 
  warrants, which are issued by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span>.  The thing to keep in mind 
  is that badges extend the syntax and evaluation capabilities of ACL2, while 
  warrants extend the proof theory.  Some user-defined function symbols may be 
  given badges even if they are in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode (see <a href="ACL2____MIXED-MODE-FUNCTIONS.html">mixed-mode-functions</a>).  If <span class="v">fn</span> has a badge, you are allowed to write 
  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a1 ... an))</span> and expect it evaluate ``correctly'' at 
  the top level of the ACL2 read-eval-print loop, just as you expect <span class="v">(fn a1
  ... an)</span> to evaluate.  But you cannot <i>prove</i> anything interesting 
  about <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a1 ... an))</span> without the warrant for <span class="v">fn</span>.  A 
  badged but unwarranted function symbol might as well be undefined as far as 
  the prover is concerned.  Warrants connect the quoted symbol to the axiomatic 
  behavior of <span class="v">apply$</span>, in particular, they constrain <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a>
  a1 ... an))</span> to be <span class="v">(fn a1 ... an)</span> under certain conditions.  Obviously, 
  the very first requirement on <span class="v">fn</span> to have a warrant is that <span class="v">fn</span> must 
  be in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.  But there are other requirements because 
  <span class="v">defwarrant</span> must make sure the extended proof theory is consistent.</p> 
 
  <h3>Requirements of <span class="v">Defbadge</span>
</h3> 
 
 
  <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFBADGE.html">defbadge</a> fn)</pre> 
 
  <p>where <span class="v">fn</span> is a defined function name in either <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> 
  or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.  This command analyzes the body of <span class="v">fn</span> to 
  determine whether it satisfies certain stringent syntactic conditions 
  discussed below.  If the conditions are not met, <span class="v">defbadge</span> signals an 
  error.  Otherwise, if records a <a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> for <span class="v">fn</span>.  Badges record the 
  input and output arities of <span class="v">fn</span> and specify which arguments are 
  ``functions'' that may be applied with <span class="v">apply$</span>, which are ``expressions'' 
  that may be evaluated with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EV_42.html">ev$</a></span>, and which are neither.  The 
  conditions checked are sufficient to allow <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> to run the function 
  safely at the top level of the ACL2 read-eval-print loop.  However, in order 
  to prove anything about the behavior of <span class="v">apply$</span> on <span class="v">fn</span> the function 
  will need a <a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a> as issued by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span>.  <span class="v">Defbadge</span> 
  does not issue warrants, just badges.  <span class="v">Defwarrant</span> can issue both badges 
  and warrants.</p> 
 
  <p>The first condition on <span class="v">fn</span> is that it must be a defined function 
  symbol that does not take or return <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> or any <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span>. 
  Since <span class="v">fn</span> must be defined it may not be a constrained function such as 
  one introduced by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>.  In addition, 
  <span class="v">fn</span> may not be one of a very few ``blacklisted'' symbols (see the value 
  of <span class="v">*blacklisted-apply$-fns*</span>) like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></span> (which requires a 
  trust tag) or an <a href="ACL2____UNTOUCHABLE.html">untouchable</a>.  (For technical reasons, untouchables 
  are disallowed even if they are on <span class="v">temp-touchable-fns</span>; see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-UNTOUCHABLE.html">remove-untouchable</a></span>.)</p> 
 
  <p>The other conditions depend on whether <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> is reachable from 
  <span class="v">fn</span>.  That is, can a call of <span class="v">fn</span> lead to a call of <span class="v">apply$</span>?  If 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> is not reachable from <span class="v">fn</span>, then there are no more conditions 
  on <span class="v">fn</span>.  A badge for fn is computed and stored.  We are more precise 
  about ``reachability'' later.</p> 
 
  <p>If <span class="v">apply$</span> is reachable from <span class="v">fn</span>, then there are additional 
  conditions that must be checked.  First, <span class="v">fn</span> must not have been 
  introduced with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span>.  The current badging machinery is 
  unable to enforce the syntactic restrictions for mutually-recursive cliques. 
  Another restriction is that every function mentioned in the body of <span class="v">fn</span>, 
  except <span class="v">fn</span> itself, must already have a badge.  Finally, <span class="v">fn</span> must 
  respect certain conventions regarding its use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> and other 
  <a href="ACL2____SCION.html">scion</a>s.  The basic idea of this last restriction is to make sure that 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> is always called on a ``known'' function symbol or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span> 
  object.  This restriction is enforced by checking the following 
  conditions:</p> 
 
  <p><i>(a)</i> It must be possible for each formal of <span class="v">fn</span> to be assigned 
  one of three <a href="ACL2____ILK.html">ilk</a>s, <span class="v">:FN</span>, <span class="v">:EXPR</span>, or <span class="v">NIL</span>, as described 
  below.  The basic idea is that a formal can be assigned ilk <span class="v">:FN</span> (or ilk 
  <span class="v">:EXPR</span>) iff it is sometimes passed into a <span class="v">:FN</span> (or <span class="v">:EXPR</span>) slot 
  in the body of <span class="v">fn</span> and is never passed into any other kind of slot.  A 
  formal can be be assigned ilk <span class="v">NIL</span> iff it is never passed into a slot of 
  ilk <span class="v">:FN</span> or <span class="v">:EXPR</span>, i.e., if it is used as an ``ordinary'' object. 
  We are more precise below.</p> 
 
  <p><i>(b)</i> Every <span class="v">:FN</span> and <span class="v">:EXPR</span> slot of every function called in 
  the body of <span class="v">fn</span> is occupied either by a formal of <span class="v">fn</span> of the same ilk 
  or, in the case of calls of functions other than <span class="v">fn</span>, a quoted <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a> function symbol or quoted tame (preferably well-formed) <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
  object.</p> 
 
  <p>This completes the list of restrictions imposed by <span class="v">defbadge</span>.</p> 
 
  <h3>Discussion and Examples</h3> 
 
  <p>Note that if <span class="v">apply$</span> is not reachable from <span class="v">fn</span>, the restrictions 
  imposed on <span class="v">fn</span> are comparatively generous.  Such a <span class="v">fn</span> could be 
  badged despite being defined mutually recursively or in terms of unbadged or 
  even unbadgeable functions.  (Functions with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span>s in their 
  signatures are unbadgeable but could be used with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-LOCAL-STOBJ.html">with-local-stobj</a></span> in 
  <span class="v">fn</span> and <span class="v">fn</span> could still be badged.)</p> 
 
  <p>After a successful <span class="v">defbadge</span> event for <span class="v">fn</span>, the function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> will return the computed badge and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> will be able to 
  accept the <span class="v">fn</span> as a functional argument.  Here is an annotated script. 
  First, carry out these two events, defining <span class="v">foldr</span> as a <span class="v">:program</span> 
  mode function.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "projects/apply/top" :dir :system)

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foldr (lst fn init)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :mode :program))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      init
      (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> fn
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)
                    (foldr (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst) fn init)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>Note the <span class="v">apply$</span> call in the definition.  We see that <span class="v">foldr</span> 
  treats its middle argument, <span class="v">fn</span>, as a function of arity 2.  We can run 
  <span class="v">foldr</span>, even without assigning a badge to <span class="v">foldr</span>, as long as we 
  supply a badged function symbol of arity 2 as the middle argument.  Since 
  the ACL2 primitive <span class="v">cons</span> has a badge and has arity 2, we can use it:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(foldr '(a b c) 'cons '(d e f))
(A B C D E F)</pre> 
 
  <p>Since <span class="v">foldr</span> has arity 3, we can try to apply it to a list of three 
  things.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'foldr (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> '(a b c) 'cons '(d e f)))

ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The value of APPLY$-USERFN is not specified
on FOLDR because FOLDR has not been badged.</pre> 
 
  <p>However, we can use <span class="v">defbadge</span> to compute the badge for <span class="v">foldr</span>. 
  The badge says foldr has input arity 3, output arity 1, and treats its middle 
  argument as a function.  We can recover the badge by calling the function 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span>.  We can successfully apply <span class="v">foldr</span>.  We can even use it in 
  a <span class="v">lambda</span> expression that we pass as the middle argument to 
  <span class="v">foldr</span>.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____DEFBADGE.html">defbadge</a> foldr)

FOLDR now has the badge (APPLY$-BADGE 3 1 NIL :FN NIL) but has no warrant.

                (foldr x 'cons y))
              nil)
(A B C D E F G H I J K)</pre> 
 
  <h3>The ``Reachability'' Test</h3> 
 
  <p>We now clarify the test that we colloquially described above as whether 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> is reachable from <span class="v">fn</span>.  The actual test is whether 
  <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span> is ancestral in <span class="v">fn</span>.  That is, does <span class="v">fn</span> call 
  <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span>, or a function that calls <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span>, or a 
  function that calls a function that calls <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span>, etc.</p> 
 
  <p>Since the only system functions that call <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span> are 
  <span class="v">apply$</span>, <span class="v">ev$</span>, and <a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a>s, and since it is very unusual for 
  a user-defined function to call directly <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span>, <span class="v">ev$</span>, or 
  warrants, we think of this test colloquially as whether <span class="v">apply$</span> is 
  ancestral in <span class="v">fn</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>The test and the onerous conditions imposed when the <span class="v">apply$</span> is 
  reachable is crucial to the soundness of the ACL2 proof theory.  We discuss 
  this further in the background material for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>, including <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/papers/apply/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>``Limited 
  Second-Order Functionality in a First-Order Setting''<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/papers/apply/index.html"></nobr></a> by Matt Kaufmann 
  and J Strother Moore and offer a fully fleshed out metalevel proof that 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> and all <span class="v">:logic</span>-mode scions can be modelled in the comment 
  titled <span class="tt">Essay on Admitting a Model for Apply$ and the Functions that Use 
  It</span> in the ACL2 source file <span class="v">apply-raw.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>But badges are more concerned with the evaluation theory than the proof 
  theory.  Even if we convert <span class="v">foldr</span> to <span class="v">:logic</span> mode we cannot prove 
  anything interesting about what happens when it is applied with 
  <span class="v">apply$</span>.</p>

  <p>In order to prove anything about applying <span class="v">foldr</span> we need the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a></span> for <span class="v">foldr</span>.  Warrants are issued by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <h3>How Ilks Are Assigned</h3> 
 
  <p>If a formal variable (or its slot among the actuals) has an ilk of 
  <span class="v">:FN</span> then the variable is ``used as a function'' in the sense that it 
  might eventually reach the first argument of a call of <span class="v">apply$</span> and is 
  never passed into an ``ordinary'' slot like those for <span class="v">cons</span>.  Similarly, 
  an ilk of <span class="v">:EXPR</span> means the variable is ``used as an expression'' and may 
  eventually reach the first argument of <span class="v">ev$</span>.  An ilk of <span class="v">NIL</span> means 
  the variable is never used as a function or an expression.  The correctness 
  of this algorithm is crucial to the safe evaluation of <span class="v">apply$</span> on 
  user-defined function symbols.  It also is crucial to the termination 
  argument justifying the consistency of the proof theory created if and when 
  <span class="v">fn</span> is warranted.</p> 
 
  <p>The key to the inductive correctness of the algorithm implicity described 
  below is the fact that initially the only function symbol with a slot of ilk 
  <span class="v">:FN</span> is <span class="v">apply$</span> and the only function with a slot of ilk <span class="v">:EXPR</span> 
  is <span class="v">ev$</span>.  In both functions it is the first argument slot that is so 
  distinguished.</p> 
 
  <p>Let <i>v </i> be the <i>i </i>th formal parameter of a defined function 
  <i>fn</i>.  Then the ilk of <i>v </i> is <span class="v">:FN</span> iff the value of <i>v </i> 
  eventually makes its way into the first argument of <span class="v">apply$</span>, either in 
  the definition of <span class="v">fn</span> or in some function ancestral to (i.e., eventually 
  called by) <span class="v">fn</span>.  Another way to say this is that there is an occurrence 
  of <i>v </i> in a slot of ilk <span class="v">:FN</span>.  Furthermore, <i>v </i> is never used 
  any other way: every place <i>v </i> occurs in the body of <i>fn </i> is in a 
  slot of ilk <span class="v">:FN</span>.  And finally, in every recursive call of <i>fn </i>, 
  <i>v </i> is passed identically in the <i>i </i>th argument position of the 
  call.  We say such a <i>v </i> is ``used (exclusively) as a function.''</p> 
 
  <p>The <i>i </i>th formal variable <i>v </i> has ilk <span class="v">:EXPR</span> under 
  analogous conditions except that instead of eventually getting into the first 
  argument of <span class="v">apply$</span> it eventually gets into the first argument of 
  <span class="v">ev$</span>.  We say such a <i>v </i> is ``used (exclusively) as an 
  expression.''  Note: <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EV_42.html">ev$</a></span> is the natural notion of expression 
  evaluation in this context: look up the values of variables in the alist 
  argument to <span class="v">ev$</span>, return quoted constants, and otherwise <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  function symbols and <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects to the recursively obtained list of 
  values returned by evaluating the actuals.  However, <span class="v">ev$</span> first checks 
  that the expression is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAMEP.html">tamep</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <p>The <i>i </i>th formal variable <i>v </i> has ilk <span class="v">NIL</span> if it never 
  occurs in a <span class="v">:FN</span> slot and never occurs in an <span class="v">:EXPR</span> slot.  We say 
  such a <i>v </i> is ``used (exclusively) as an ordinary object.''</p>
