<p>Conversions between natural numbers 
          and their representations as digits in arbitrary bases.</p><p>In these utilities, the digits are natural numbers below the base. 
     The base (a natural number above 1) is supplied as argument.</p><p>There are conversions for big-endian and little-endian representations. 
     There are conversions to represent natural numbers as lists of digits 
     of fixed length, of minimum length, and of minimum non-zero length.</p><p>The name of some functions in these utilities start with <span class="v">dab</span>, 
     which stands for `digits any base'. 
     Without this prefix, the names seem too ``general''.</p>
