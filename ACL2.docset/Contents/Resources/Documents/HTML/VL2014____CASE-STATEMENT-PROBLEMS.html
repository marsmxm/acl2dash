<p>The official behavior of <span class="v">case</span>, <span class="v">casez</span> and <span class="v">casex</span> is 
problematic with respect to X and Z values.</p><p>Generally speaking, Verilog's behavioral modeling constructs are 
rife with problems when it comes to the handling of unknown and high-impedence 
values.  Even the basic <span class="v">if</span> statement treats X values as false, which is 
deeply troubling—if we don't know what some value is, we certainly should 
not simply assume it is false.</p> 
 
<p>Verilog's <span class="v">case</span>, <span class="v">casex</span>, and <span class="v">casez</span> statements have especially 
bad behavior with regards to X and Z values.</p> 
 
<p>For basic <span class="v">case</span> statements, each match is compared against the test 
expression using case-equality <span class="v">===</span> instead of ordinary equality <span class="v">==</span>. 
This allows you to match precisely against X and Z, which can easily lead to an 
improper, non-conservative treatment of X.</p> 
 
<p>The fancier <span class="v">casez</span> and <span class="v">casex</span> statements are especially badly 
behaved.  At first glance these statements seem pretty convenient.  For 
instance, in <span class="v">casez</span> you are told that you can use <span class="v">Z</span> or (equivalently) 
<span class="v">?</span> as a pattern-matching character.  You might look at a code fragment like 
this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">casez (inst)
  5'b00001: out = a + b;
  5'b0001?: out = a - b;
  5'b001??: out = a &amp; b;
  5'b01???; out = a | b;
  default:  out = 16'hXXXX;
endcase</pre> 
 
<p>And think—<i>wow, that looks nice</i>.  You might expect that the 
second pattern here, <span class="v">5'b0001?</span>, will match:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>00010</li> 
<li>00011</li> 
<li>0001X</li> 
<li>0001Z</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>And you're right.  Unfortunately, what you probably did not expect, is that 
this pattern will <b>also</b> match many other values, like:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Z0010</li> 
<li>ZZ010</li> 
<li>ZZ0Z0</li> 
<li>ZZZZZ</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>And so on.  This is because Z values are treated as wildcards not only in 
your pattern, but also <i>in the data itself</i>, which is terrible and makes 
no sense at all.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">casex</span> statement is even worse.  Here, any X or Z values in the data 
will match anything you've written in your pattern.  So, for instance,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">casex (inst)
  5'b00001: out = GOOD;
  default:  out = BAD;
endcase</pre> 
 
<p>Will, quite unexpectedly, produce GOOD for instructions such as <span class="v">XXXXX</span>, 
<span class="v">ZZZZZ</span>, and so on.</p>
