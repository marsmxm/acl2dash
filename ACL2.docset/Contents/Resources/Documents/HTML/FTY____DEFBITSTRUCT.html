<p>Define a bitvector type with accessors for its fields.</p><p>This macto defines a bitstruct type.  A bitstruct can either be a 
base type, which is a single fixed-width integer, or a product type containing 
fields that are bits, Booleans, or other bitstructs.  Such a product is 
represented as a single integer produced by concatenating all the fields 
together, where the first field is least significant.</p> 
 
<h5>Examples:</h5> 
 
<p>A bitstruct can be made up of single bits and Booleans.  (The difference is 
only in the return type of the accessors and the input type of the updaters; 
the representation is the same.)  The fields are ordered LSB first, so <span class="v">a</span> 
is bit 0 of the representation and <span class="v">c</span> is bit 2.  This defines a predicate, 
fixing function, accessors, and a constructor similar to <span class="v">defprod</span>, but also 
updaters such as <span class="v">!foo-&gt;a</span>.</p> <pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> foo
  ((a bitp)
   (b booleanp)
   (c bitp)))</pre> 
 
<p>A bitstruct can also contain fields that are other bitstructs.  Here, the 
first field is a <span class="v">foo</span>, which is three bits wide, so the <span class="v">b</span> and <span class="v">c</span> 
fields are bits 3 and 4, respectively.  Also, since <span class="v">:signedp t</span> was 
specified, the representation is signed: the product is represented as a 5-bit 
signed integer rather than a 5-bit natural.</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> bar
  ((myfoo foo-p)
   (b booleanp)
   (c bitp))
  :signedp t)</pre> 
 
<p>A bitstruct can also be defined without any fields, giving only a 
width. These are mainly useful as fields of other bitstructs.  This makes sense 
when the individual bits aren't meaningful, and their combined value is what's 
important.  This defines a rounding-control as a 2-bit unsigned value.</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> rounding-control 2)</pre> 
 
<p>Sometimes we may want to nest one bitstruct inside another, but also 
directly access the fields of the internal struct.  Providing the 
<span class="v">:subfields</span> keyword causes defbitstruct to produce direct accessors and 
updaters for the subfields of the nested struct.  The following definition of 
<span class="v">mxcsr</span> produces the usual accesors and updaters including <span class="v">mxcsr-&gt;flags</span> 
and <span class="v">mxcsr-&gt;masks</span>, but also <span class="v">mxcsr-&gt;ie</span> and <span class="v">mxcsr-&gt;im</span>, etc.</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> fp-flags
  ((ie bitp)
   (de bitp)
   (ze bitp)
   (oe bitp)
   (ue bitp)
   (<a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a> bitp)))

(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> mxcsr
  ((flags fp-flags :subfields (ie de ze oe ue pe))
   (daz bitp)
   (masks fp-flags :subfields (im dm zm om um pm))
   (rc  rounding-control)
   (ftz bitp)))</pre> 
 
<h5>Syntax</h5> 
<p>A <span class="v">defbitstruct</span> form is one of:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> typename fields [ options ] )</pre> 
<p>or</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> typename width [ options ] ).</pre> 
<p>The syntax of fields is described below.</p> 
 
<h5>Top-level options</h5> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:pred</span>, <span class="v">:fix</span>, <span class="v">:equiv</span> -- override the default names (foo-p, 
foo-fix, and foo-equiv) for the predicate, fixing function, and equivalence 
relation.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:parents</span>, <span class="v">:short</span>, <span class="v">:long</span> -- provide xdoc for the bitstruct</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:signedp</span> -- when true, represents the structure as a signed integer 
rather than an unsigned one.  (Signed and unsigned fields can be used inside 
unsigned and signed bitstructs -- they are simply sign- or zero-extended as 
necessary when accessed.)</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h5>Field Syntax</h5> 
<p>A field has the following form:</p> 
<pre class="code">(fieldname type [ docstring ] [ options ... ] )</pre> 
 
<p>The type can be either a predicate or type name, i.e., <span class="v">bit</span> or 
<span class="v">bitp</span>, and must refer to either a single-bit type (bit or boolean) or a 
previously-defined bitstruct type.  The docstring is a string which may contain 
xdoc syntax.</p> 
 
<h5>Field Options</h5> 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:accessor</span>, <span class="v">:updater</span> -- override the default names 
<span class="v">struct-&gt;field</span>, <span class="v">!struct-&gt;field</span> for the accessor and updater 
functions.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:default</span> -- change the default value for the field in the 
<span class="v">make-foo</span> macro.  The default default is NIL for Boolean fields and 0 for 
everything else.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:rule-classes</span> -- override the rule classes of the accessor function's 
return type theorem.  The default is <span class="v">:rewrite</span>; it may be appealing to use 
<span class="v">:type-prescription</span>, but typically the type prescription for the accessor 
should be determined automatically anyway.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:subfields</span> -- Indicates that accessors and updaters should be created 
for subfields of this field, and gives their subfield names.  See the section 
on subfields below.</li> </ul> 
 
<h5>Subfields</h5> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">:subfields</span> field option may only be used on a field whose type is 
itself a bitstruct type containing fields.  The value of the <span class="v">:subfields</span> 
argument should be a list of <span class="v">subfield_entries</span>, according to the following 
syntax:</p> 
 <pre class="code">subfield_entry ::= name | ( name ( subfield_entry ... ) )</pre> 
 
<p>Each top-level entry corresponds to a subfield of the field type.  If the 
entry uses the second syntax, which itself has a list of entries, those entries 
correspond to sub-subfields of the subfield type.  For example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> innermost
  ((aa bitp)
   (bb bitp)))

(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> midlevel
  ((ii innermost :subfields (iaa ibb))
   (qq bitp)
   (jj innermost :subfields (jaa jbb))))

(<a href="FTY____DEFBITSTRUCT.html">defbitstruct</a> toplevel
  ((ss innermost :subfields (saa sbb))
   (tt midlevel  :subfields ((tii (tiaa tibb))
                             tqq
                             tjj))))</pre> 
 
<p>For the <span class="v">toplevel</span> bitstruct, this generates the following subfield 
accessors, in addition to the direct accessors <span class="v">toplevel-&gt;ss</span> and 
<span class="v">toplevel-&gt;tt</span>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(toplevel-&gt;saa x)    == (innermost-&gt;aa (toplevel-&gt;ss x))
(toplevel-&gt;sbb x)    == (innermost-&gt;bb (toplevel-&gt;ss x))
(toplevel-&gt;tii x)    == (midlevel-&gt;ii (toplevel-&gt;ss x))
(toplevel-&gt;tiaa x)   == (innermost-&gt;aa (midlevel-&gt;ii (toplevel-&gt;tt x)))
(toplevel-&gt;tibb x)   == (innermost-&gt;bb (midlevel-&gt;ii (toplevel-&gt;tt x)))
(toplevel-&gt;tqq x)    == (midlevel-&gt;qq (toplevel-&gt;tt x))
(toplevel-&gt;tjj x)    == (midlevel-&gt;jj (toplevel-&gt;tt x))</pre>
