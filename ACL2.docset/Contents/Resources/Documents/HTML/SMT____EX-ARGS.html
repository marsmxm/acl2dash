<p>Argument list for function expand</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>term-lst — <span class="tt">pseudo-term-list</span>
</dt> 
<dd>List of terms to be expanded. The function 
    finishes when all of them are expanded to given level.</dd> 
 
<dt>fn-lst — <a href="SMT____FUNC-ALIST.html">func-alist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>List of function definitions to use for 
      function expansion.</dd> 
 
<dt>fn-lvls — <a href="SMT____SYM-NAT-ALIST.html">sym-nat-alist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Levels to expand each functions to.</dd> 
 
<dt>wrld-fn-len — <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Number of function definitions in curent world.</dd> 
 
<dt>expand-lst — <a href="SMT____PSEUDO-TERM-ALIST.html">pseudo-term-alist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>An alist of expanded function symbols 
    associated with their function call</dd> 
 
</dl><p><span class="v">Ex-args</span> stores the list of arguments passed into the 
    function <a href="SMT____EXPAND.html">expand</a>. We design this product type so that we don't have a 
    long list of arguments to write down every time there's a recursive call. 
    This document describes what each argument is about and more specifically, 
    why they exist necessarily. This document comes out because every time when 
    I read the <a href="SMT____EXPAND.html">expand</a> function, I get confused and lost track about why I 
    designed such a argument in the first place.</p> 
 
    <p><span class="v">Term-lst</span> is easy, it stores the list of terms to be expanded. 
    Recursively generated new terms are stored in this argument and gets used 
    in recursive calls. Using a list of terms allows us to use a single 
    recursive function instead of <a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a>, even though every 
    time we call this function, we really just have one term to expand.</p> 
 
    <p><span class="v">Fn-lst</span> stores a list of function definitions for use of expansion. 
    This list comes from the <a href="SMT____SMTLINK-HINT.html">smtlink-hint</a> stored in function stub <a href="SMT____SMT-HINT.html">smt-hint</a>. Such a list initially comes from user inputs to <a href="SMT____SMTLINK.html">Smtlink</a>. 
    So it can be, for example, some functions that the user wants to get 
    expanded specially.</p> 
 
    <p><span class="v">Fn-lvls</span> stores a list of maximum number of times each function 
    needs to be expanded. This list doesn't take into account of functions that 
    are not specified by the user, which should oftenly be the case. In that 
    case, those functions will be expanded just once and a pair will be stored 
    into <span class="v">fn-lvls</span> indicating this function has already been expanded. This 
    is done by storing a level of 0 for such a function.</p> 
 
    <p><span class="v">Wrld-fn-len</span> is the hardest to explain. But given some thought, I 
    found it to be necessary to have this argument. <span class="v">wrld-fn-len</span> represents 
    the length of current ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, meaning the number of definitions 
    in total (might be more than that, I'm not completely sure about what the 
    <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> is composed of). This argument helps prove termination of 
    function <a href="SMT____EXPAND.html">expand</a>. See <a href="SMT____EXPAND-MEASURE.html">expand-measure</a> for a discussion about 
    the measure function for proving termimation.</p> 
 
    <p><span class="v">Expand-lst</span> stores all functions that are expanded in <a href="SMT____EXPAND.html">expand</a>. 
    This list gets used later for generating the <span class="v">:in-theory</span> hint for 
    proving that the expanded term implies the original unexpanded term.</p>
