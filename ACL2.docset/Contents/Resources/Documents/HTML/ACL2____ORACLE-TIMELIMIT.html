<p>Carry out some computation, returning (not just printing!) how long 
it took and (on supported Lisps) how many bytes were allocated, but aborting 
the execution if it takes too long.</p><p>The <span class="v">oracle-timelimit</span> macro is similar to <a href="ACL2____ORACLE-TIME.html">oracle-time</a> 
except that besides reporting times, it also allows you impose a limit on how 
long the form is allowed to run for and how much memory it is allowed to use. 
If execution takes too long or allocates too much memory, execution is 
aborted.</p> 
 
<p><b>Warning</b>.  This book is intended to be a practically useful tool, but 
it may not be entirely sound.  In particular:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>In case of a timeout, execution will (of course) not complete normally.  If 
the computation you are timing includes, for instance, updates to <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s 
or the <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, then the stobjs may have been only partially updated. 
This might especially pose a soundness problem for <a href="ACL2____DEFABSSTOBJ.html">abstract stobjs</a> since the stobj invariant might be ruined 
if a sequence of writes is interrupted.</li> 
 
<li>The internal, core, intermediate part of the computation makes use of a 
<a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a> style macro that will not return the right results when the 
computation is timed out.  The top-level <span class="v">oracle-timelimit</span> macro accounts 
for this, but in principle a malicious user could directly call the internal 
macro to easily cause unsoundness.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h5>Basic Example</h5> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ORACLE-TIMELIMIT.html">oracle-timelimit</a> 1/3 ; Fail if more than 1/3 second is needed
  (fib 35))           ; What to execute
--&gt;
(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> successp          ; Did the computation complete in time?
    seconds           ; Time taken (rational number of seconds)
    bytes             ; Bytes allocated (natural)
    ans               ; Answer on success, or NIL on timeout
    state)            ; Adjusted with changes to oracle</pre> 
 
<h5>Example with Multiple Return Values</h5> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ORACLE-TIMELIMIT.html">oracle-timelimit</a> 5        ; Fail if more than 5 seconds are needed
  (<a href="ACL2____RANDOM_42.html">random$</a> 100 state)      ; What to execute
  :ret    (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> ans state)   ; Return signature of the form to execute
  :onfail (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> :oops state) ; Alternate values to return on timeout
  )
--&gt;
(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> successp          ; Did the computation complete in time?
    seconds           ; Time taken (rational number of seconds)
    bytes             ; Bytes allocated (natural)
    ans               ; Answer on success, or :oops on timeout
    state)            ; Adjusted with changes to the oracle</pre>

<h5>General Form</h5> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ORACLE-TIMELIMIT.html">oracle-timelimit</a>
  timelimit            ; rational valued time limit
  form                 ; what to execute
  [:ret    retspec]    ; return signature for form
  [:onfail failspec]   ; return values for timeout case
  [:maxmem bytes]      ; maximum memory allocation to allow (CCL Only)

  ;; Special option to catch Lisp errors that arise during form
  [:suppress-lisp-errors bool]
  )</pre> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">timelimit</span> should evaluate to a rational number which is interpreted 
as some number of seconds.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">form</span> can be any arbitrary ACL2 form that you want to execute.  If 
this form returns an ordinary, single value, e.g., as in <span class="v">(fib 35)</span>, then 
the <span class="v">:ret</span> form is not needed.  Otherwise, <span class="v">:ret</span> should explain the 
return signature of form, as in <a href="ACL2____ORACLE-TIME.html">oracle-time</a>.</p> 
 
<p>(CCL Only) If provided, the <span class="v">:maxmem</span> should specify a memory ceiling in 
bytes; the default is <span class="v">nil</span>, in which case no memory ceiling is imposed. 
This is a very rough mechanism and its implementation may change in the future. 
The memory usage is checked only occasionally (i.e., once per second or 
similar).  Note that we check the global memory usage of the entire ACL2 
process, with no regard to which thread has allocated the memory or how much 
memory was allocated before the computation began.</p> 
 
<p>The return value of <span class="v">oracle-timelimit</span> extends the return value of 
<span class="v">form</span> with multiple values.  The basic idea is that <span class="v">oracle-timelimit</span> 
is going to macroexpand to something like the following:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a> retspec
    form
  (<a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> (((<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> &amp; successp state) (<a href="ACL2____READ-ACL2-ORACLE.html">read-acl2-oracle</a> state))
       ((<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> &amp; time state)     (<a href="ACL2____READ-ACL2-ORACLE.html">read-acl2-oracle</a> state))
       ((<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> &amp; bytes state)    (<a href="ACL2____READ-ACL2-ORACLE.html">read-acl2-oracle</a> state))
       ;; Fix time/bytes to sensible values
       (time     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> time) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> 0 time)) time 0))
       (bytes    (<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> bytes))
       ((unless successp)
        ;; execution timed out
        (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> nil time bytes failspec [state])))
     ;; Else, execution succeeded
     (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> t time bytes retspec [state])))</pre> 
 
<p>You can see here that the <span class="v">retspec</span> is used to explain how to bind the 
results of executing the form.  It is also, essentially, spliced into the 
return values for the success and failure cases.  The only twist is that if 
<span class="v">retspec</span> mentions <span class="v">state</span>, then we don't add an extra <span class="v">state</span> onto 
the end of the form.</p> 
 
<p>By default, if <span class="v">form</span> causes a raw Lisp error such as a type error, stack 
overflow, or causes some other non-local exit such as throwing to a tag, the 
error will propagate through the <span class="v">oracle-timelimit</span> call.  However, if you 
set <span class="v">:suppress-lisp-errors t</span>, then any such error will be treated as a 
timeout.  This may have any number of unsound consequences!</p>
