<p>Functions for recognizing and following well-formed hierarchical 
identifiers, scoped identifiers, and indexing expressions.</p><h3>VL Terminology</h3> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog provides a very rich syntax for referring to objects in 
different scopes and throughout the module hierarchy.  To deal with this rich 
syntax, we will need a bit of jargon.  These terms are well-defined notions in 
VL, but may not necessarily be found or used in the same way in the 
Verilog/SystemVerilog standards.</p> 
 
<p><u>Identifiers.</u> We say the following expressions are just 
<b>identifiers</b>.  Note that the Verilog/SystemVerilog standards sometimes 
distinguish between plain and escaped identifiers.  While our <a href="VL2014____LEXER.html">lexer</a> 
needs to understand these as different notions, internally there is no 
difference.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">foo
\foo$bar</pre> 
 
<p>Note that any indexing/selection operations after an identifier is 
<b>not</b> part of the identifier.  For instance, <span class="v">foo[3]</span> and <span class="v">foo[3:0]</span> 
are not identifiers: they are index/selection operations applied to the 
identifier <span class="v">foo</span>.  (This may seem obvious, but we draw your attention to it 
because it is less obvious for hierarchical identifiers.)</p> 
 
<p><u>Hierarchical identifiers</u>.  Identifiers can be chained together, 
perhaps with indexing, to form <b>hierarchical identifiers</b>.  Here are 
examples of hierarchical identifiers:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">foo                     // any ID is a HID
\foo$bar

foo.bar                 // fancier HIDs
foo.bar.baz

foo.bar[3].baz          // Verilog-2005 or SystemVerilog-2012
foo.bar[3][4].baz       // SystemVerilog-2012</pre> 
 
<p>Hierarchical identifiers may have internal indexing expressions.  However, 
any subsequent indexing/selection operations are <b>not</b> part of the HID 
itself.  For instance, we say that <span class="v">foo.bar[3].baz[2]</span> and 
<span class="v">foo.bar[3].baz[3:0]</span> are <b>not</b> a hierarchical identifiers.  Instead, 
these are indexing/selection operators applied to a HID.</p> 
 
<p><u>Scope expressions</u>.  Hierarchical identifiers can be prefixed with 
scoping operations, e.g., for packages.  Here are some examples of scope 
expressions:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">foo                             // any ID is a scope expression
\foo$bar

foo.bar                         // any HID is a scope expression
foo.bar.baz
foo.bar[3].baz
foo.bar[3][4].baz

mypkg::foo                      // fancier scope expressions
mypkg::foo.bar
$unit::foo::bar.baz[3].beep</pre> 
 
<p>As with ordinary identifiers and hierarchical identifiers, scope expressions 
do <b>not</b> have any indexing/selection operators.  For example, 
<span class="v">mypkg::foo[3]</span> is not a scope expression, but is instead an indexing 
operator applied to the scope expression <span class="v">mypkg::foo</span>.</p> 
 
<p><u>Index expressions</u>.  Scope expressions can be indexed into by some 
number of individual bit/array-indexing operations.  Here are some examples of 
index expressions:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">foo                             // any ID is an index expression
\foo$bar

foo.bar                         // any HID is an index expression
foo.bar.baz
foo.bar[3].baz
foo.bar[3][4].baz

mypkg::foo                      // any scope expression is an index expression
mypkg::foo.bar
$unit::foo::bar.baz[3].beep

foo[3]                          // fancier index expressions
foo[3][4][5]
foo.bar[3]
mypkg::foo[3][4][5]
$unit::foo::bar.baz[3].beep[2][1][0]</pre> 
 
<p>Note that an index expression does <b>not</b> have any part/range selects in 
it.  That is, an expression like <span class="v">foo[3][5:0]</span> is not an index expression; 
instead it is a part-selection operator applied to the index expression 
<span class="v">foo[3]</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Note that part/range selection operations, like <span class="v">foo[3:0]</span>, are just an 
ordinary operator and we do not give them any special designation.  Why, then, 
do we give special treatment to indexing?  In short, part-selection is simpler 
than indexing because there can be at most a single part-select.  In contrast, 
there can be many levels of array indexing, and so typically indexing needs to 
be handled recursively.</p> 
 
<h3>Low Level Representation</h3> 
 
<p>VL internally represents hierarchical identifiers as compound <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-P.html">vl-expr-p</a> objects.  To understand the structure, consider a very complex index 
expression such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">ape::bat::cat.dog[3][2][1].elf[7][6][5]</pre> 
 
<p>We expect to represent this sort of expression by nesting operations as 
suggested by the parentheses below.  This arrangement matches the jargon 
above.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">Indexing is the outermost operation:

  (((  ape::bat::cat.dog[3][2][1].elf     )[7] )[6] )[5]
       ------------------------------   -------------------
                a scopexpr              recursive indexing


Followed by scoping:

             ape::(bat::         (cat.dog[3][2][1].elf)  )
       ---------------------      --------------------
         recursive scoping              a hidexpr


Followed by hierarchy:

                     cat . ((dog [3][2][1]) . elf)
                           -----------------------
                                sub hidexpr

With hierarchical indexing going from outermost to innermost:

                           ((dog [3])[2])[1]
                           -----------------
                              a hidindex</pre> 
 
<p>Where each <span class="v">.</span> is represented by a <span class="v">:vl-hid-dot</span> operator, each 
<span class="v">[]</span> by a <span class="v">:vl-index</span> operator, each <span class="v">::</span> by a <span class="v">:vl-scope</span> 
operator, and the names are represented as <a href="VL2014____VL-HIDPIECE-P.html">vl-hidpiece-p</a> atoms.</p> 
 
<h3>Abstract Representation</h3> 
 
<p>The low-level <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-P.html">vl-expr-p</a> representation is not very strongly typed and 
permits nonsensical expressions like <span class="v">foo.5.bar.(1+2)</span>, which should never 
be produced by our parser or by well-behaving internal VL code.  Because of 
this, most functions for working with HIDs should not and do not use the 
internal representation directly.</p> 
 
<p>Instead, in <a href="VL2014____ABSTRACT-HIDS.html">abstract-hids</a>, we set up wrapper functions that provide 
an interface for working with hierarchical identifier expressions at a somewhat 
higher level.  These wrapper functions include stronger recognizers that ensure 
that an expression is a well-formed hierarchical identifier, scope expression, 
or index expression that meets our usual expectations.  It also provides 
convenient accessor functions for traversing well-formed expressions.</p> 
 
<h3>Following HIDs</h3> 
 
<p>For many kinds of transformation and analysis, the fundamental operation on 
hierarchical, scoped, or indexed expressions is to follow them to what they 
refer to.  To do this correctly requires an detailed understanding of both the 
concepts above and also <a href="VL2014____SCOPESTACK.html">scopestack</a>s for looking up identifiers.</p> 
 
<p>Due to this complexity, most code throughout VL should never try to follow 
hierarchical identifiers on its own.  Instead, most code should be make use of 
the high-level functions described in <a href="VL2014____FOLLOWING-HIDS.html">following-hids</a>.</p>
