<p>ATJ tutorial: Java Representation of the ACL2 Terms.</p><p>For the <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-DEEP.html">deep embedding approach</a>, <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-AIJ.html">AIJ</a> provides a Java representation of the ACL2 terms. 
    Since ACL2 terms are also ACL2 values, 
    in principle the <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-ACL2-VALUES.html">Java representation of the ACL2 values</a> provided by AIJ could be used to represent the ACL2 terms as well. 
    However, it is more convenient to use 
    a more specialized representation, 
    described in this tutorial page. 
    This tutorial page may be skipped at first reading.</p><h5>ACL2 Translated Terms</h5><p>The set of ACL2 <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">translated</a> terms consists of 
    (i) variables, 
    which are symbols, 
    (ii) quoted constants, 
    which are lists <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a> value)</span> where <span class="v">value</span> is a value, 
    and (iii) function applications, 
    which are lists <span class="v">(fn arg1 ... argn)</span> 
    where <span class="v">fn</span> is a function 
    and <span class="v">arg1</span>, ..., <span class="v">argn</span> are zero or more terms. 
    A function <span class="v">fn</span> used in a term is 
    (i) a named function, 
    which is a symbol, 
    or (ii) a lambda expression, 
    which is a list <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (var1 ... varm) body)</span> 
    where <span class="v">var1</span>, ..., <span class="v">varm</span> are zero or more symbols 
    and <span class="v">body</span> is a term, 
    whose free variables are all among <span class="v">var1</span>, ..., <span class="v">varm</span> 
    (i.e. lambda expressions are always closed).</p><h5>Java Classes</h5><p>AIJ represents ACL2 terms in a manner similar to ACL2 values, 
    as objects of class <span class="v">Acl2Term</span> and its subclasses in the <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-SIMPLIFIED-UML.html">simplified UML class diagram</a> below. 
    Functions are represented 
    as objects of class <span class="v">Acl2Function</span> and its subclasses 
    in the same diagram. 
    The classes with subclasses are abstract, 
    while classes without subclasses are concrete. 
    All these classes are public, except <span class="v">Acl2DefinedFunction</span>. 
    The information about the represented ACL2 terms (and functions) 
    is stored in private fields.</p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/kestrel-java-atj-images/term-classes.png"></div><p><span class="v">Acl2Variable</span> is a wrapper of <span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span>, and 
    <span class="v">Acl2QuotedConstant</span> is a wrapper of <span class="v">Acl2Value</span>; 
    these wrappers place <span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span> and <span class="v">Acl2Value</span> 
    into the class hierarchy of <span class="v">Acl2Term</span>, 
    given that Java does not support multiple class inheritance 
    (e.g. <span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span> could not be 
    both a subclass of <span class="v">Acl2Value</span> and a subclass of <span class="v">Acl2Term</span>). 
    An <span class="v">Acl2FunctionCall</span> stores 
    an <span class="v">Acl2Function</span> and zero or more <span class="v">Acl2Term</span>s.</p><p>An <span class="v">Acl2LambdaExpression</span> stores 
    zero or more <span class="v">Acl2Variable</span>s and an <span class="v">Acl2Term</span>. 
    <span class="v">Acl2NamedFunction</span> is a wrapper of <span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span>, 
    placing <span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span> into the class hierarchy of <span class="v">Acl2Function</span>. 
    AIJ's Java representation of named functions 
    differentiates between native and defined functions. 
    An <span class="v">Acl2DefinedFunction</span> stores a definition 
    consisting of zero or more formal parameters (<span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span>s) 
    and of a body (an <span class="v">Acl2Term</span>), 
    which are put together into a lambda expression 
    (as in a higher-order equality <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> ...))</span>). 
    An <span class="v">Acl2NativeFunction</span> represents an ACL2 function 
    that is <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-NATIVE-FUNCTIONS.html">implemented natively via Java code</a>, not via (a Java representation of) an ACL2 definiens. 
    Here `native' is with respect to ACL2, not Java; 
    it has nothing to do with <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/specs/jni" target="_blank"><nobr>JNI<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/specs/jni"></nobr></a>. There is an instance of <span class="v">Acl2NativeFunction</span> 
    for each <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">ACL2 primitive function</a>: these could not be instances of <span class="v">Acl2DefinedFunction</span>, 
    because they have no ACL2 definition. 
    There are also instances of <span class="v">Acl2NativeFunction</span> 
    for other built-in ACL2 functions, 
    and more may be added in the future, 
    particularly for execution efficiency.</p><h5>Java Factory and Getter Methods</h5><p>The classes for ACL2 terms (and functions) provide 
    public static factory methods to build instances of these classes, 
    but no public Java constructors, 
    similarly to <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-ACL2-VALUES.html">the classes for ACL2 values</a>. In the <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-DEEP.html">deep embedding approach</a>, the Java code generated by ATJ 
    uses these factory methods to build the terms in the definientia 
    of the ACL2 functions that are being translated to Java. 
    Note that since <span class="v">Acl2QuotedConstant</span> wraps <span class="v">Acl2Value</span>, 
    the ATJ-generated Java code also uses 
    the factory methods of the classes of ACL2 values.</p><p>The classes for ACL2 terms (and functions) do not provide 
    getter methods to extract information, 
    unlike the classes for the ACL2 values. 
    The reason is that code external to AIJ 
    (including the code generated by ATJ) 
    only needs to build terms, not unbuild them. 
    In contrast, code external to AIJ, 
    and to ATJ-generated code, 
    may need to unbuild the results obtained by evaluating 
    calls of ACL2 functions.</p><h5>More Information</h5><p>For more details on AIJ's implementation and API of ACL2 terms,
