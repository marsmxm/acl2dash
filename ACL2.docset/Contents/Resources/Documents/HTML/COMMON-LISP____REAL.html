<p>ACL2(r) support for real numbers</p><p>ACL2 supports rational numbers but not real numbers.  However, 
 starting with Version 2.5, a variant of ACL2 called ``ACL2(r)'' supports the 
 real numbers by way of non-standard analysis.  ACL2(r) was conceived and first 
 implemented by Ruben Gamboa in his Ph.D.  dissertation work, supervised by Bob 
 Boyer with active participation by Matt Kaufmann.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2(r) has the same source files as ACL2.  After you download ACL2, you 
 can build ACL2(r) by executing the following command on the command line in 
 your acl2-sources directory, replacing <span class="v">&lt;your_lisp&gt;</span> with a path to your 
 Lisp executable:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">make large-acl2r LISP=&lt;your_lisp&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>This will create an executable in your acl2-sources directory named 
 <span class="v">saved_acl2r</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that if you have fetched the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>, then you will 
 already have the books to be certified with ACL2(r).  They can 
 be certified from your acl2-sources directory, shown here as <span class="v">&lt;DIR&gt;</span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">make regression ACL2=&lt;DIR&gt;/saved_acl2r</pre> 
 
 <p>To check that you are running ACL2(r), see if the prompt includes the 
 string ``<span class="v">(r)</span>'', e.g.:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2(r) !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Or, look at <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> acl2-version)</span> and see if ``<span class="v">(r)</span>'' is a 
 substring.</p> 
 
 <p>In ACL2 (as opposed to ACL2(r)), when we say ``real'' we mean 
 ``rational.''</p> 
 
 <p>Caution: ACL2(r) should be considered experimental: although we (Kaufmann 
 and Moore) have carefully completed Gamboa's integration of the reals into the 
 ACL2 source code, our primary concern has been to ensure unchanged behavior 
 when ACL2 is compiled in the default manner, i.e., without the non-standard 
 extensions.  As for every release of ACL2, at the time of a release we are 
 unaware of soundness bugs in ACL2 or ACL2(r).</p> 
 
 <p>There is only limited documentation on the non-standard features of 
 ACL2(r).  We hope to provide more documentation for such features in future 
 releases.  Please feel free to query the authors if you are interested in 
 learning more about ACL2(r).  Gamboa's dissertation may also be helpful.</p> 
 
<p>ACL2(r) does not currently support the <a href="ACL2____USELESS-RUNES.html">useless-runes</a> feature.</p>
