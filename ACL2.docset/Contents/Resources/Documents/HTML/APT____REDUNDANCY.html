<p>Notion of redundancy for APT transformations.</p><p>A call of an APT transformation is redundant if and only if 
     it is identical to a previous successful call of the same transformation 
     whose <span class="v">:show-only</span> input is not <span class="v">t</span>, 
     except that the two calls may differ in 
     their <span class="v">:print</span> and <span class="v">:show-only</span> inputs. 
     These options do not affect the generated events, 
     and thus they are ignored for the purpose of redundancy.</p><p>A call of an APT transformation whose <span class="v">:show-only</span> input is <span class="v">t</span> 
     does not generate any event. 
     No successive call may be redundant with such a call.</p>
