<p>How to produce a <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for a book</p><p>Also see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for information about the 
 <span class="v">".cert"</span> file produced by <span class="v">certify-book</span>, in particular for 
 information about the use of <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> values to help ensure that the 
 corresponding book has not been modified since certification.  See <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK-DEBUG.html">certify-book-debug</a> for some potential remedies for failures of

 <p>where <span class="v">book-name</span> is a book name (see <a href="ACL2____BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a>), <span class="v">k</span> is used 
 to indicate your approval of the ``certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>,'' and 
 <span class="v">compile-flg</span> can control whether the book is to be compiled.  The defaults 
 for <span class="v">compile-flg</span>, <span class="v">skip-proofs-okp</span>, <span class="v">acl2x</span>, <span class="v">write-port</span>, 
 <span class="v">pcert</span>, and <span class="v">:useless-runes</span> can be affected by environment variables. 
 All of these arguments are described in detail below, except for <span class="v">:pcert</span> 
 and <span class="v">:useless-runes</span>: see <a href="ACL2____PROVISIONAL-CERTIFICATION.html">provisional-certification</a> and <a href="ACL2____USELESS-RUNES.html">useless-runes</a>, respectively, for the effects of these two arguments and their 
 corresponding environment variables, as we ignore those effects in the present 
 topic.</p> 
 
 <p>Certification occurs in some logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, called the 
 ``certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.''  That <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> must contain the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>s needed to read and execute the forms in the book.  The <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s necessary to recreate that <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> from the ACL2 initial <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> are called the ``<a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> commands,'' and will be copied into 
 the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> created for the book.  Those <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s will be 
 re-executed whenever the book is included, to ensure that the appropriate 
 packages (and all other names used in the certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>) are 
 correctly defined.  Note that Step 1 of <span class="v">certify-book</span> will fail if a 
 package mentioned in the book is not defined before attempting the 
 certification, i.e., defined by a portcullis command in the certification 
 world.  For example, suppose that your book contains the symbol <span class="v">FOO::X</span>, 
 but the package "FOO" is not currently defined.  Then an error message will 
 likely complain either about a missing package <span class="v">"FOO"</span>, or about a symbol 
 <span class="v">FOO::X</span> that is ``not in any of the packages known to ACL2.''  A solution 
 is to define the package "FOO", perhaps directly using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> or by 
 including a book that defines this package, before attempting the 
 certification.</p> 
 
 <p>The certified book will be more often usable if the certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> is kept to a minimal extension of the ACL2 initial <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> (for 
 example, to prevent name clashes with functions defined in other books, or to 
 avoid including undesired rules).  Alternatively, use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> to build your certification world, as these will be skipped when 
 including the certified book.  But perhaps it's simplest just to get into the 
 initial ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> (e.g., with <span class="v">:ubt 1</span> or by just starting a new 
 ACL2 run), then define the desired packages (directly with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> or 
 by including books that define the packages), and finally invoke 
 <span class="v">certify-book</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">k</span> argument to <span class="v">certify-book</span> has default value <span class="v">0</span>, and it 
 must be either a nonnegative integer or else the symbol <span class="v">?</span> in any package. 
 If <span class="v">k</span> is an integer, then it must be the number of <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s that 
 have been executed after the initial ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> to create the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> in which <span class="v">certify-book</span> was called.  One way to obtain this number 
 is by doing <span class="v">:pbt :start</span> to see all the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s back to the first 
 one.</p> 
 
 <p>Otherwise, <span class="v">k</span> is <span class="v">?</span> (or any symbol whose <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> is 
 <span class="v">"?"</span>).  In that case there is no check made on the certification world. 
 This can be a nice convenience but at the cost of eliminating a potentially 
 valuable check that the certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> may be as expected.</p> 
 
 <p>We next describe the meaning of <span class="v">compile-flg</span> and how it defaults.  If 
 explicit compilation has been suppressed by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-COMPILER-ENABLED.html">set-compiler-enabled</a> nil
 state)</span>, then <span class="v">compile-flg</span> is coerced to <span class="v">nil</span>; see <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a>.  Otherwise <span class="v">compile-flg</span> may be given the value of <span class="v">t</span> (or 
 <span class="v">:all</span>, which is equivalent to <span class="v">t</span> except during provisional 
 certification; see <a href="ACL2____PROVISIONAL-CERTIFICATION.html">provisional-certification</a>), indicating that the book 
 is to be compiled, or else <span class="v">nil</span>.  (Note that compilation initially creates 
 a compiled file with a temporary file name, and then moves that temporary file 
 to the final compiled file name obtained by adding a suitable extension to the 
 book name.  Thus, a compiled file will appear atomically in its intended 
 location.)  Finally, suppose that <span class="v">compile-flg</span> is not supplied (or is 
 <span class="v">:default</span>).  If environment variable <span class="v">ACL2_COMPILE_FLG</span> is defined and 
 not the empty string, then its value should be <span class="v">T</span>, <span class="v">NIL</span>, or <span class="v">ALL</span> 
 after converting to upper case, in which case <span class="v">compile-flg</span> is considered 
 to have value <span class="v">t</span>, <span class="v">nil</span>, or <span class="v">:all</span> (respectively).  Otherwise 
 <span class="v">compile-flg</span> defaults to <span class="v">t</span>.  Note that the value <span class="v">:all</span> is 
 equivalent to <span class="v">t</span> except for during the Convert procedure of provisional 
 certification; see <a href="ACL2____PROVISIONAL-CERTIFICATION.html">provisional-certification</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Two keyword arguments, <span class="v">:defaxioms-okp</span> and <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp</span>, 
 determine how the system handles the inclusion of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> events and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> events, respectively, in the book.  The value <span class="v">t</span> 
 allows such events, but prints a warning message.  The value <span class="v">nil</span> causes 
 an error if such an event is found.  <span class="v">Nil</span> is the default unless keyword 
 argument <span class="v">:acl2x t</span> is provided and state global <span class="v">'write-acl2x</span> is a 
 cons (see <a href="ACL2____SET-WRITE-ACL2X.html">set-write-ACL2x</a>), in which case the default is <span class="v">t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The keyword argument <span class="v">:ttags</span> may normally be omitted.  A few 
 constructs, used for example if you are building your own system based on 
 ACL2, may require it.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> for an explanation of this 
 argument.</p> 
 
 <p>When book <span class="v">B</span> is certified with value <span class="v">t</span> (the default, unless the 
 value used for <span class="v">pcert</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>) for keyword argument 
 <span class="v">:write-port</span>, a file <span class="v">B.port</span> is written by certification process. 
 This file contains all of the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s for <span class="v">B</span>, 
 i.e., all user commands present in the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> at the time 
 <span class="v">certify-book</span> is called.  If <span class="v">B.lisp</span> later becomes uncertified, say 
 because <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> from that file or an included book have been edited, 
 then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "B")</span> will consult <span class="v">B.port</span> to evaluate forms in 
 that file before evaluating the events in <span class="v">B.lisp</span>.  On the other hand, 
 <span class="v">B.port</span> is ignored when including <span class="v">B</span> if <span class="v">B</span> is certified.</p> 
 
 <p>If you use <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s, please note <span class="v">certify-book</span> is executed as 
 though <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> t)</span> has been evaluated; see <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>.  If you want to run with different guard-checking, 
 consider using <span class="v">ld</span> instead, or in addition; see <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For a general discussion of books, see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  <span class="v">Certify-book</span> is 
 akin to what we have historically called a ``proveall'': all the forms in the 
 book are ``proved'' to guarantee their admissibility.  More precisely, 
 <span class="v">certify-book</span> (1) reads the forms in the book, confirming that the 
 appropriate packages are defined in the certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>; (2) does 
 the full admissibility checks on each form (proving termination of recursive 
 functions, proving theorems, etc.), checking as it goes that each form is an 
 embedded event form (see <a href="ACL2____EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>); (3) may roll back the 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> (how far? — see below) and perform an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 to check for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> incompatibilities (see <a href="ACL2____LOCAL-INCOMPATIBILITY.html">local-incompatibility</a>); (4) writes a <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> recording not only 
 that the book was certified but also recording the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s necessary 
 to recreate the certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> (so the appropriate packages can be 
 defined when the book is included in other <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s) and a <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> for each of the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> involved (see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>); and 
 (5) compiles the book if so directed (and then loads the object file in that 
 case).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Certify-book</span> is a macro that returns an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>, where 
 success is indicated by an error component of <span class="v">nil</span> and has the effect of 
 extending the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> with a corresponding <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event. 
 If you don't want the included book's <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in your present <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, simply execute <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____U.html">u</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Technical Remark.  Step 3 above mentions rolling the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> 
 back to check for local incompatibilities.  For efficiency, this retraction to 
 an initial segment of the the world is skipped if a local event is not 
 encountered, and otherwise the world is rolled back through the first local 
 event past the boot-strap world — see <a href="ACL2____LOCAL-INCOMPATIBILITY.html">local-incompatibility</a> 
 — before the book is included to check for local incompatibilities. 
 Note that if that first local event is in the certification world, then all 
 commands from that event onward will be undone by the <span class="v">certify-book</span> call. 
 End of Technical Remark.</p> 
 
 <p>A utility is provided to assist in debugging failures of <span class="v">certify-book</span>; 
 see <a href="ACL2____REDO-FLAT.html">redo-flat</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Certify-book</span> requires that the default <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> (see <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a>) be <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> when certification is attempted. 
 If the mode is not <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>, an error is signaled.</p> 
 
 <p>An error will occur if <span class="v">certify-book</span> has to deal with any uncertified 
 book other than the one on which it was called.  For example, if the book 
 being certified includes another book, that sub-book must already have been 
 certified; that is, that sub-book must have a valid <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> 
 file.</p> 
 
 <p>If you have a certified book that has remained unchanged for some time you 
 might well not remember the appropriate <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>s for it, though they 
 are stored in the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> file and (by default) also in the 
 <span class="v">.port</span> file.  If you begin to change the book, don't throw away its <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> file just because it has become invalid!  It is an important 
 historical document until the book is re-certified.  More important, don't 
 throw away the <span class="v">.port</span> file, as it will provide the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> 
 commands when including the book as an uncertified book; see <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">certify-book</span> is directed to produce a compiled file, it calls the 
 Common Lisp function <span class="v">compile-file</span> on the original source file.  This 
 creates a compiled file with an extension known to ACL2, e.g., if the book is 
 named <span class="v">"my-book"</span> then the source file is <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span> and the 
 compiled file under GCL will be <span class="v">"my-book.o"</span> while under SBCL it will be 
 <span class="v">"my-book.fasl"</span>.  The compiled file is then loaded.  When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> is used later on <span class="v">"my-book"</span> it will automatically load the 
 compiled file, provided the compiled file has a later write date than the 
 source file.  The only effect of such <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> and loading is that 
 the functions defined in the book execute faster.  See <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> for a 
 discussion of the issues, and if you want more details about <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> and 
 compilation, see <a href="ACL2____BOOK-COMPILED-FILE.html">book-compiled-file</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">certify-book</span> is directed not to produce a compiled file, it will 
 delete any existing compiled file for the book, so as not to mislead <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> into loading the now outdated compiled file.  Otherwise, 
 <span class="v">certify-book</span> will create a temporary ``expansion file'' to compile, 
 obtained by appending the string "@expansion.lsp" to the end of the book 
 name.  Remark: Users may ignore that file, which is automatically deleted 
 unless <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global variable <span class="v">'save-expansion-file</span> has been set, 
 presumably by a system developer, to a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value; see <a href="ACL2____BOOK-COMPILED-FILE.html">book-compiled-file</a> for more information about hit issue, including the role 
 of environment variable <span class="v">ACL2_SAVE_EXPANSION</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>After execution of a <span class="v">certify-book</span> form, the value of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span> is restored to what it was immediately before that 
 <span class="v">certify-book</span> form was executed.  See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Those who use the relatively advanced features of trust tags (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>) and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> may wish to know how to create a <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> file that avoids dependence on trust tags that are used only 
 during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> expansion.  For this, including documentation of the 
 <span class="v">:acl2x</span> and <span class="v">:ttagsx</span> keyword arguments for <span class="v">certify-book</span>, see 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-WRITE-ACL2X.html">set-write-ACL2x</a>.</p>
