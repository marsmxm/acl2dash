<p>Where we look for translation data.</p><p>The constant <a href="VL2014_____A2VLS-ROOT_A2.html">*vls-root*</a> defines the root directory for our 
translation data.</p> 
 
<p>Each subdirectory of this directory is called a <b>base</b>.  At Centaur, we 
typically run the translator once per day, and we introduce a new base for each 
day's translations.  That is, the base <span class="tt">2010-05-31</span> contains the 
translations from May 31, 2010, etc.</p> 
 
<p>Note: as a special convenience, if the name of a base begins with 
<span class="tt">_temp_</span>, we regard it as currently being generated and do not include 
it in our file scans.  Our translation scripts put everything into a directory 
like <span class="tt">_temp_2010-05-31</span>, then finally rename this directory to 
<span class="tt">2010-05-31</span> when they're done.</p> 
 
<p>Each base should contain a collection of subdirectories called 
<b>models</b>.  Each model directory contains files like <span class="tt">model.sao</span> and 
<span class="tt">esims.sao</span>, which are created by the <span class="v">vl model</span> command.  Having 
multiple models is useful when you are translating many different chips.</p> 
 
<p>Given <span class="tt">*vls-root*</span>, the name of a particular base and model are 
sufficient for identifying where a particular translation exists on the 
disk.</p>
