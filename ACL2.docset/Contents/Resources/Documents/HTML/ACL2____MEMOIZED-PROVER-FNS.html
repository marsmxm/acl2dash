<p>Memoize some theorem prover functions</p><p>In the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>, the book 
 <span class="v">tools/memoize-prover-fns.lisp</span> arranges to <a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a> some functions 
 in the theorem prover.  Including this book MAY, in some cases, improve 
 performance; perhaps more likely, including this book may degrade performance! 
 So if you decide to include this book, it would serve you well to experiment 
 by changing the list of prover functions to memoize.  To do this you can 
 proceed as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a>
  (unmemoize-lst (<a href="ACL2____F-GET-GLOBAL.html">f-get-global</a> 'memoized-prover-fns state))
  (<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>
   (<a href="ACL2____PPROGN.html">pprogn</a> (<a href="ACL2____F-PUT-GLOBAL.html">f-put-global</a> 'memoized-prover-fns '(... &lt;your_list&gt; ...) state)
           (<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> '(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> nil))))
  (memoize-lst (<a href="ACL2____F-GET-GLOBAL.html">f-get-global</a> 'memoized-prover-fns state)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Of course, you can run experiments that compare times for your proofs with 
 different prover functions memoized (or, no prover functions memoized).  In 
 addition, as usual with memoization, you can evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MEMSUM.html">memsum</a>)</span> after 
 trying some proofs to see if the functions you have memoized result in good 
 ratios of hits to calls.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that this book automatically provides an attachment to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FINALIZE-EVENT-USER.html">finalize-event-user</a></span>.  So it might not work well with other books that provide 
 such an attachment.  For this book, the attachment clears the memoization 
 tables after each book not under <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  (That restriction 
 could easily be lifted, but perhaps it's useful for performance.  And perhaps 
 not â€” feel free to experiment!)</p> 
 
 <p>If you find a good set of prover functions to memoize, please consider 
 modifying the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____F-PUT-GLOBAL.html">f-put-global</a></span> call in the aforementioned book, 
 <span class="v">tools/memoize-prover-fns.lisp</span>, for your own set of prover 
 functions.</p>
