<p>Reading post-induction key checkpoints</p><p>Each post-induction key checkpoint is a theorem if and only if the 
 original conjecture was a theorem.  The reason is that each subgoal produced 
 by induction concludes with the original formula and simplification preserves 
 equivalence.</p> 
 
 <p>So if you see a post-induction key checkpoint that is not a theorem, stop 
 looking at the checkpoints!  Your original conjecture is not a theorem!  Fix 
 it.</p> 
 
 <p>If you're convinced all the post-induction conjectures are theorems, ask 
 whether each has the hypotheses you'd need to prove it.  If the case analysis 
 feels inappropriate or induction hypotheses seem to be missing, then ACL2 
 might have done the wrong induction.  Find the induction scheme it did by 
 reading the first induction message printed after the conjecture was 
 submitted.  If it is wrong, then extend ACL2's induction analysis or tell ACL2 
 what induction to do, as explained shortly.</p> 
 
 <p>But before you decide the induction hypothesis is missing, look closely for 
 contradictions among the hypotheses of the checkpoint formula.  For example, 
 perhaps one of the hypotheses is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> e x)</span> and another is <span class="tt">(NOT 
 (MEMBER e' x'))</span> where <span class="v">e</span>, <span class="v">x</span>, <span class="v">e'</span>, and <span class="v">x'</span> are possibly 
 complicated expressions.</p> 
 
 <p>Is it possible that <span class="v">e</span> and <span class="v">e'</span> are equal and <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">x'</span> are 
 equal?  If so, then the two hypotheses are contradictory and the checkpoint 
 would be proved if you could find rules that would simplify those expressions 
 to their common forms.  So look for theorems about those subexpressions.</p> 
 
 <p>Or maybe you can get <span class="v">e</span> and <span class="v">e'</span> to reduce to some common <span class="v">d</span> but 
 but find that <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">x'</span> are really different.  Then ask whether</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> d x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> d x'))</pre> 
 
 <p>If you could prove that, the key checkpoint would be proved.  Of course, 
 you may need other hypotheses from the checkpoint to state your theorems.</p>
