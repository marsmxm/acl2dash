<p>A model of C integers for ATC.</p><p>We define a model of the C standard signed and unsigned integer values, 
     except <span class="v">_Bool</span> for now, 
     based on their <a href="C____INTEGER-FORMATS.html">format definitions</a> and <a href="C____INTEGER-RANGES.html">range definitions</a>. As mentioned in the documentation of the integer formats, 
     the definitions of values we give here 
     should still work if the format definitions are changed.</p><p>For each C integer type covered by our model, 
     we define the C values as wrappers of ACL2 integers in appropriate ranges. 
     We also define lists of these C values, 
     and some operations between these lists 
     and lists of ACL2 integers in the corresponding ranges.</p><p>For the unsigned types, 
     we also introduce ACL2 functions 
     to turn ACL2 integers into values of those types 
     by reducing them modulo one plus the maximum value of the type. 
     These functions are used 
     to define certain C integer conversions and operations, 
     which are modular for unsigned integer types.</p>
