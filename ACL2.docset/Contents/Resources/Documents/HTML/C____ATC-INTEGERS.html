<p>A model of C integers for ATC.</p><p>We define a model of the C standard signed and unsigned integer values, 
     except <span class="v">_Bool</span> for now, 
     based on their <a href="C____ATC-INTEGER-FORMATS.html">format definitions</a>. As mentioned there, the definitions of values we give here 
     should still work if the format definitions are changed.</p><p>For each C integer type covered by our model, 
     we define ACL2 signed or unsigned integers corresponding to them 
     (via <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFBYTE.html">fty::defbyte</a></span>), and 
     we define the C values by wrapping those signed or unsigned integers. 
     We also define maximum and (for signed) minimum integers, 
     prove some linear rules about them, 
     and prove rules that provide alternative definitions 
     of the signed and unsigned ACL2 integers in terms of minima and maxima. 
     This gives us the ability to view the integer ranges 
     as ACL2's <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">signed-byte-p</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a></span> values, 
     which is useful for bitwise operations, 
     but also as plain integers in certain ranges, 
     which should lead to simpler reasoning about ranges.</p><p>For the unsigned types, 
     we also introduce ACL2 functions 
     to turn ACL2 integers into values of those types 
     by reducing them modulo one plus the maximum value of the type. 
     These functions are used 
     to define certain C integer conversions and operations, 
     which are modular for unsigned integer types.</p>
