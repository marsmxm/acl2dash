<p>An abstraction of the <b>B</b>oolean <b>F</b>unction 
<b>R</b>epresentation used by GL.</p><p>GL was originally designed to operate on <a href="ACL2____UBDDS.html">ubdds</a>, with support 
for hons-<a href="ACL2____AIG.html">aig</a>s and <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> added later.  To avoid redoing a lot of 
proof work, a small level of indirection was added.</p> 
 
<p>The particular Boolean function representation that we are using at any 
particular time is governed by <a href="FGL____BFR-MODE.html">bfr-mode</a>, and operations like 
<span class="v">bfr-and</span> allow us to construct new function nodes using whatever the 
current representation is.</p> 
 
<p>To support aignets, it is important for BFRs to be well-formed, 
i.e. literals whose node index is in bounds for the current aignet.  So we 
also use a <a href="FGL____BFRSTATE.html">bfrstate</a> object which simultaneously tracks the bfr-mode and 
current bound.</p>
