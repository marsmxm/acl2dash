<p>Introduce functions with some constraints unspecified</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> for relevant background. 
 <span class="v">Partial-encapsulate</span> is a variant of <span class="v">encapsulate</span> for which some of 
 the constraints are implicit.  This is an advanced capability that is useful 
 when one installs special-purpose code, possibly in raw Lisp, using a trust 
 tag (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>).</p> 
 
 <h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
 <p>The syntax for <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> is the same as the syntax of 
 <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, except for the addition of an argument, <span class="v">supporters</span>, 
 which is described below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____PARTIAL-ENCAPSULATE.html">partial-encapsulate</a> (<a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> ... signature)
  (f1 ... fk) ; supporters
  ev1
  ...
  evn)</pre> 
 
 <p>where, as for <span class="v">encapsulate</span>: each <span class="v">signature</span> is a well-formed <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>, each describing a different function symbol, and each <span class="v">evi</span> is 
 an embedded event form (see <a href="ACL2____EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>).  The additional 
 argument (shown above) is a true-list of function symbols, the 
 <i>supporters</i>: it is an error if any such symbol, <span class="v">fi</span>, is not a known 
 function symbol at the time the <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> call is evaluated, 
 the exception being that <span class="v">fi</span> may be introduced in one of the signatures. 
 A <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> form must satisfy the following three requirements 
 in addition to those of the corresponding <span class="v">encapsulate</span> form: it must have 
 at least one signature, it must not occur within any other <span class="v">encapsulate</span> or 
 <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> form that has at least one signature, and every 
 function symbol that it introduces must be specified in one of the 
 signatures.</p> 
 
 <p>A call of <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> introduces its signature functions 
 together with its exported theorems, exactly as though it had been the call of 
 <span class="v">encapsulate</span> with the same signatures and events, however with one 
 difference: the <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> logically incorporates additional 
 constraints that are not mentioned.  This is discussed further below, but for 
 now let us note that because of this difference, a successful evaluation of a 
 <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> form results in a special ``unknown-constraints'' 
 designation for the functions introduced by the signatures.  Any attempt to 
 access the constraints for those functions will thus fail.  Consider the 
 following example, which introduces <span class="v">f</span> as a constrained function symbol 
 that is constrained not only by the property that <span class="v">f</span> returns a boolean, 
 but also by additional, unspecified (implicit) constraints.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____PARTIAL-ENCAPSULATE.html">partial-encapsulate</a>
 ((f (x) t))
 nil
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)))
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> booleanp-f
   (<a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a> (f x))
   :rule-classes :type-prescription))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> symbolp-f
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> (f y)))

(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 ((<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (x) t))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)))
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> booleanp-g (<a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then the following fails, even though it would succeed if we replace 
 <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> by <span class="v">encapsulate</span> above.  The reason is that the 
 partial-encapsulate form allows for constraints beyond just the property that 
 <span class="v">f</span> is boolean.  Imagine that special code had been inserted (using a trust 
 tag) for reasoning about <span class="v">f</span> when proving a theorem like <span class="v">symbolp-f</span> 
 that we were now trying to functionally instantiate.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; Functional instantiation FAILS because of unknown-constraints on f
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> symbolp-g
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> y))
  :hints (("Goal" :by (:functional-instance symbolp-f (f g)))))</pre> 
 
 <h3>Supporters and corresponding encapsulate</h3> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> represents any <span class="v">encapsulate</span> form that 
 introduces the same function symbols, has the same signatures, and extends the 
 constraints introduced such that every function symbol occurring in at least 
 one of the additional constraints must either be mentioned in one of the 
 <span class="v">evi</span> or be among the list of supporters, <span class="v">(f1 ... fk)</span>.  We may refer 
 to such an <span class="v">encapsulate</span> form as a ``corresponding encapsulate''.  The user 
 of <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> should keep in mind such a set of additional 
 constraints.  The supporters should thus include all function symbols in the 
 theorems exported from the intended corresponding encapsulate, except that 
 signature functions are always included among the supporters whether specified 
 or not, and hence their inclusion is optional.</p> 
 
 <p>The list of supporters is used for generating proof obligations for a 
 <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>.  Specifically, the supporters 
 serve as the ``ancestors'' of the partial encapsulate's signature functions, 
 in the constraint-generation algorithm described in the documentation for 
 <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>.  Thus, if supporters are missing that occur in the intended 
 corresponding encapsulate, then functional instantiation may be unsound 
 because some proof obligations fail to be generated.  Note that in the typical 
 application described next, where the implicit constraints all specify 
 evaluation results for calls of signature functions as discussed below, the 
 specified list of supporters can simply be <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Applications</h3> 
 
 <p>A trust tag (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>) is not needed for evaluation of a 
 partial-encapsulate form.  However, for a typical application of 
 partial-encapsulate — redefinition of a constrained function in raw Lisp 
 — a trust tag is of course necessary (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>).  In such a 
 case, the corresponding encapsulate may be viewed as extending the original 
 partial-encapsulate with all theorems of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f a1 ... ak)
 val)</span>, ranging over all computations <span class="v">(f a1 ... ak)</span> ever to be 
 evaluated (a finite but potentially huge set) where <span class="v">val</span> is the value 
 returned for <span class="v">(f a1 ... ak)</span>.  It is the responsibility of the creator of 
 such an application to ensure that all evaluations satisfy the original 
 constraints of the partial-encapsulate.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that in this sort of application — that is, where the implicit 
 constraints all arise from function evaluations — the supporters 
 argument may soundly be <span class="v">nil</span>, since only the signature functions are 
 involved in the implicit constraints (and those functions are automatically 
 included among the supporters, even when not specified by the user).</p> 
 
 <p>For an example of such an application, including explanatory comments, see 
 <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a> <span class="v">books/demos/partial-encapsulate.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Partial-encapsulates are, in essence, also used in the implementation of 
 dependent clause-processors, where the list of supporters might well be 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFINE-TRUSTED-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">define-trusted-clause-processor</a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Implementation</h3> 
 
 <p>This section is provided as a reference for those interested, but can 
 probably be safely skipped by most readers.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider the following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:trans1 (<a href="ACL2____PARTIAL-ENCAPSULATE.html">partial-encapsulate</a>
                ((f0 (x) t))
                (g0)
                (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f0 (x) x))
                (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> f0-prop
                  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> x)
                           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> (f0 x)))))
 (<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">ENCAPSULATE</a> ((F0 (X) T))
              (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">LOCAL</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">DEFUN</a> F0 (X) X))
              (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">DEFTHM</a> F0-PROP
                      (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">INTEGERP</a> X)
                               (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">INTEGERP</a> (F0 X))))
              (SET-UNKNOWN-CONSTRAINTS-SUPPORTERS G0))
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>This example illustrates that a <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> call expands to a 
 call of <span class="v">encapsulate</span> obtained by removing the supporters argument, but 
 with the following extra event inserted after given list of events, where 
 <span class="v">(f1 ... fk)</span> is the specified list of supporters.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(set-unknown-constraints-supporters f1 ... fk)</pre> 
 
 <p>The macro, <span class="v">set-unknown-constraints-supporters</span>, extends a table, 
 <span class="v">unknown-constraints-table</span>.  As evaluation of the partial-encapsulate 
 concludes, the world is extended so that each signature function has a 
 <span class="v">'constraint-lst</span> property indicating that its constraints are unknown, but 
 with supporters (``ancestors'', as discussed above) according to that table. 
 This macro call can thus be inserted non-<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a>ly within an encapsulate, 
 anywhere after the local function definitions, to make an encapsulate behave 
 like a partial-encapsulate.</p>
