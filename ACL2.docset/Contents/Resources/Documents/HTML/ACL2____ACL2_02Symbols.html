<p>ACL2 Symbols</p><p>Common Lisp's symbols are a data type representing words.  They are 
 frequently regarded as atomic objects in the sense that they are not 
 frequently broken down into their constituents.  Often the only important 
 properties of symbols is that they are not numbers, characters, strings, or 
 lists and that two symbols are not equal if they look different (!).  Examples 
 of symbols include <span class="v">PLUS</span> and <span class="v">SMITH::ABC</span>.  All function and variable 
 names in ACL2 are symbols.  When symbols are used as constants they must be 
 quoted, as in <span class="v">'PLUS</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The symbol <span class="v">T</span> is commonly used as the Boolean ``true.''  The symbol 
 <span class="v">NIL</span> is commonly used both as the Boolean ``false'' and as the ``empty 
 list.''  Despite sometimes being called the ``empty list'' <span class="v">NIL</span> is a 
 <b>symbol</b> not an ``empty cons.''  Unlike other symbols, <span class="v">T</span> and 
 <span class="v">NIL</span> may be used as constants without quoting them.</p> 
 
 <p>Usually, symbols are written as sequences of alphanumeric characters other 
 than those denoting numbers.  Thus, <span class="v">A12</span>, <span class="v">+1A</span> and <span class="v">1+</span> are symbols 
 but <span class="v">+12</span> is a number.  Roughly speaking, when symbols are read lower case 
 characters are converted to upper case, so we frequently do not distinguish 
 <span class="v">ABC</span> from <span class="v">Abc</span> or <span class="v">abc</span>.  Click <a href="ACL2____Conversion.html">here</a> for information about case conversion when symbols 
 are read.  However, any character can be used in a symbol, but some characters 
 must be ``escaped'' to allow the Lisp reader to parse the sequence as a 
 symbol.  For example, <span class="v">|Abc|</span> is a symbol whose first character is 
 capitalized and whose remaining characters are in lower case.  <span class="v">|An odd
 duck|</span> is a symbol containing two #\Space characters.  See any Common Lisp 
 documentation for the syntactic rules for symbols.</p> 
 
 <p>Technically, a symbol is a special kind of pair consisting of a package 
 name (which is a string) and a symbol name (which is also a string).  (See 
 <a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> and 
 see <a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.)  The symbol SMITH::ABC is said to be in package 
 "SMITH" and to have the symbol name "ABC".  The symbol <span class="v">ABC</span> in package 
 "SMITH" is generally not equal to the symbol <span class="v">ABC</span> in package "JONES". 
 However, it is possible to ``import'' symbols from one package into another 
 one, but in ACL2 this can only be done when the package is created.  (See 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.)  If the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-PACKAGE.html">current-package</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> is 
 "SMITH" then <span class="v">SMITH::ABC</span> may be more briefly written as just <span class="v">ABC</span>. 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____INTERN.html">Intern</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> ``creates'' a symbol of a given name in a given 
 package.</p>
