<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2-PC____WRAP-INDUCT">Click for ACL2-pc::wrap-induct in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>(atomic macro) 
same as induct, but create a single goal</p><pre class="code">Examples:
wrap-induct
(wrap-induct t)
(wrap-induct (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> x) y))

General Form:
(wrap-induct &amp;optional term)</pre> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">wrap-induct</span> command is identical to the interactive <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a></span>'s <span class="v">induct</span> command (see <a href="ACL2-PC____INDUCT.html">ACL2-pc::induct</a>), except that 
 only a single goal is created: the conjunction of the base and induction 
 steps.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: The output will generally indicate that more than goal has been 
 created, e.g.:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Creating two new goals:  (MAIN . 1) and (MAIN . 2).</pre> 
 
 <p>However, <span class="v">wrap-induct</span> always creates a unique goal (when it succeeds). 
 A subsequent message clarifies this, for example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">NOTE: Created ONLY one new goal, which is the current goal:
  (MAIN . 1)</pre>
