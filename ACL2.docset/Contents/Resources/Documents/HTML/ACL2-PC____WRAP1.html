<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2-PC____WRAP1">Click for ACL2-pc::wrap1 in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>(primitive) 
combine goals into a single goal</p><pre class="code">Examples:
; Keep (main . 1) and (main . 2) if they exist, as well as the current goal;
; and for each other goal, conjoin it into the current goal and delete it:
(wrap1 ((main . 1) (main . 2)))

; As explained below, conjoin all subsequent siblings of the current goal
; into the current goal, and then delete them:
(wrap1)

General Form:
(wrap1 &amp;optional kept-goal-names)</pre> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">kept-goal-names</span> is not <span class="v">nil</span>, the current goal is replaced by 
 conjoining it with all goals other than the current goal and those indicated 
 by <span class="v">kept-goal-names</span>, and those other goals are deleted.  If 
 <span class="v">kept-goal-names</span> is omitted, then the the current goal must be of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NAME.html">name</a> . n)</span>, and the goals to conjoin into the current goal (and delete) 
 are those with names of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NAME.html">name</a> . k)</span> for <span class="v">k</span> &gt;= <span class="v">n</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>NOTE: <span class="v">Wrap1</span> always ``succeeds'', even if there are no other goals to 
 conjoin into the current goal (a message is printed in that case), and it 
 always leaves you with no hypotheses at the top of the current goal's 
 conclusion (as though <span class="v">top</span> and <span class="v">demote</span> had been executed, if 
 necessary).</p>
