<p>A verified clause-processor and customized rewriter for large terms 
  that uses existing ACL2 rewrite rules to prove theorems.</p><p>RP-Rewriter (rp for 'retain property') is a verified clause processor 
  that can be used to replace ACL2's rewriter for some theorems, and for some 
  cases, can provide time efficiency and convenience when building lemmas. It 
  uses a subset of the heuristics of the ACL2's rewriter but adds two 
  distinctive features: 1. By introducing an invariant, it can retain 
  properties about terms, which we call side-conditions. 2. In the case of 
  alists in the theorems to be rewritten, it can create a corresponding 
  fast-alist in the background. It also has some other improvements pertaining 
  to meta-rules.</p> <p> It supports a big set of rewrite rules existing in 
  ACL2's world that may have syntaxp. For every other rule-classes, it treats 
  them as rewrire-rules. It also provides a mechanism to run meta 
  functions. The rest of the rule classes are not supported and are discarded 
  by the rewriter. We also do not support rules with <a href="ACL2____BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a>, <a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">ACL2::loop-stopper</a>, <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">ACL2::free-variables</a>, <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>, <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a> etc. Note that there is also no <a href="ACL2____TYPE-ALIST.html">ACL2::type-alist</a> or any 
  form of type reasoning.  </p> <p> The rewriter enables users to attach 
  certain properties (i.e., side-conditions) to terms as rewriting takes 
  place. These properties can be used to relieve hypotheses efficiently without 
  backchaining.</p> 
 
 <p> If a rewrite rule has <a href="ACL2____HONS-ACONS.html">hons-acons</a> on its right hand side, 
  rp-rewriter has a built-in mechanism that treats that as a trigger function 
  to create a fast-alist in the background. When another term seems to be 
  trying to read a value from that alist with a known instance of a function 
  such as assoc-equal, the built in meta functions reads the value from the 
  corresponding fast-alist instead of tracing it in the logical term. This may 
  give great timing benefits when dealing with terms with large alists. </p>
