<p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-FREE.html">fast-alist-free</a> alist)</span> throws away the hash table associated 
with a fast alist.</p><p>Logically, this function is the identity; we leave it enabled and 
 would think it odd to ever prove a theorem about it.</p> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, <span class="v">fast-alist-free</span> removes the hash table associated with 
 this alist, if one exists.  This effectively converts the alist into an 
 ordinary alist.</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-FREE-ON-EXIT.html">fast-alist-free-on-exit</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When the host Lisp is CCL or SBCL, the associated hash table may be freed 
 up automatically by the garbage collector when the corresponding alist is no 
 longer referenced.  (To trigger garbage collection manually, see <a href="ACL2____GC_42.html">gc$</a>.) 
 But for Lisp implementations other than CCL and SBCL this is not the case so, 
 to avoid memory leaks, you should use <span class="v">fast-alist-free</span> to free up 
 associated hash tables that will no longer be used.  You may find <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-SUMMARY.html">fast-alist-summary</a></span> useful in tracking down alists that were not properly 
 freed.</p> 
 
 <p>It is safe to call <span class="v">fast-alist-free</span> on any argument, including fast 
 alists that have already been freed and objects which are not alists at 
 all.</p>
