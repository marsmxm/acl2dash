<p>A loop generate construct, after elaboration.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-GENELEMENT.html">vl-genelement</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name  <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>Name of the block array, if named.</dd> 
 
<dt>var  <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Iterator variable name.</dd> 
 
<dt>genvarp  <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Was the variable declared using the genvar keyword, locally</dd> 
 
<dt>blocks  <a href="VL____VL-GENBLOCKLIST.html">vl-genblocklist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Blocks produced by the loop</dd> 
 
<dt>loc  <a href="VL____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Where the loop came from in the Verilog source code.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>This is a post-elaboration representation of a generate for 
              loop, where the loop itself is gone and we instead have something 
              like a list of begin/end blocks for each value that <span class="v">var</span> took 
              on during the loop's execution.</p> 
 
              <p>This representation may seem weird but notice that things like 
              the sizes of wires can change from iteration to iteration if they 
              depend on the loop variable, and similarly other things within 
              the loop like <span class="v">if/else</span> generate blocks may depend on the loop 
              variable and so may need to differ from iteration to iteration. 
              To support these kinds of things, we really do want a 
              representation where each block can be separated from the others 
              and processed independently.</p>
