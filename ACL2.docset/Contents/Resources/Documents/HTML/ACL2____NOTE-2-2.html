<p>ACL2 Version  2.2 (August, 1998) Notes</p><p>Important changes:</p> 
 
 <p>A bug was fixed in the compile command, <span class="v">:comp</span>.  The compiled code 
 produced by <span class="v">:comp</span> in previous versions could be wildly incorrect because 
 of a confusion between the printer and the reader regarding what was the 
 current Lisp <span class="v">*package*</span>.  This bug could manifest itself only if you used 
 the <span class="v">:comp</span> command to compile previously uncompiled functions while the 
 current package was different from <span class="v">"ACL2"</span>.  What happened in that 
 situation depended upon what symbols were imported into your current package. 
 The most likely behavior is that the compiler would break or complain or the 
 resulting compiled code would call functions that did not exist.</p> 
 
 <p>There have been no other important changes to the code.</p> 
 
 <p>However, this release contains some useful new books, notably those on the 
 <span class="v">books</span> subdirectories <span class="v">cli-misc</span> and <span class="v">ihs</span>.  Both have <span class="v">README</span> 
 files.  The <span class="v">ihs</span> books provide support for integer hardware 
 specifications.  These books were crucial to Bishop Brock's successful 
 modeling of the Motorola CAP.  We thank Bishop for producing them and we thank 
 all those who worked so hard to get these books released.  We highly recommend 
 the <span class="v">ihs</span> books to those modeling ALUs and other arithmetic components of 
 microprocessors or programming languages.</p> 
 
 <p>In previous versions of ACL2, the arithmetic books, found on 
 <span class="v">books/arithmetic/</span>, included the addition of several unproved axioms 
 stating properties of the rationals that we believed could be derived from our 
 ``official'' axioms but which we had not mechanically proved.  The axioms were 
 found in the book <span class="v">rationals-with-axioms.lisp</span>, which was then used in the 
 uppermost arithmetic books <span class="v">top.lisp</span> and <span class="v">top-with-meta.lisp</span>.  John 
 Cowles has now provided us with ACL2 proofs of those ``axioms'' and so in this 
 release you will find both <span class="v">rationals-with-axioms.lisp</span> and 
 <span class="v">rationals-with-axioms-proved.lisp</span>.  The former is provided for 
 compatibility's sake.  The latter is identical but contains <span class="v">defthm</span>s where 
 the former contains <span class="v">defaxiom</span>s.  The top-most books have been rebuilt 
 using ``<span class="v">-axioms-proved</span>'' book.  Thanks John.</p> 
 
 <p>Less important notes:</p> 
 
 <p>Bishop Brock found a bug in <span class="v">translated-acl2-unwind-protectp4</span>.  Jun 
 Sawada reported a bug in linear arithmetic that caused us not to prove certain 
 trivial theorems concluding with <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> i j))</span>.  We have fixed 
 both.</p> 
 
 <p>We now prohibit definitions that call certain event commands such as 
 <span class="v">DEFTHM</span> and <span class="v">TABLE</span> because our Common Lisp implementations of them 
 differ from their ACL2 meanings (so that compiled books can be loaded 
 correctly and efficiently).</p> 
 
 <p>Minor bugs in the documentation were fixed.</p>
