</dl><h5>Additional Requirements</h5><p>The following invariant is enforced on the fields:</p><pre class="code">(vl-namefactory-namedb-okp mod namedb)</pre><p>A <b>name factory</b> allows you to easily and efficiently generate 
good, fresh names that are not being used elsewhere in a Verilog module.  They 
combine a name database (which is a general mechanism for generating fresh 
names; see <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-P.html">vl-namedb-p</a> for details) with a Verilog module in order to 
avoid computing the module's namespace until a name is actually needed.  This 
optimization often saves a lot of consing.</p> 
 
<h3>Using Name Factories</h3> 
 
<p>Typically, given some module <span class="v">mod</span>, the user begins by constructing a 
name factory using <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-STARTING-NAMEFACTORY.html">vl-starting-namefactory</a> mod)</span>.  Note that it is quite 
cheap to construct a name factory in this way; all expense is delayed until the 
first use of the factory.  It is also possible to create a name factory without 
a module using <a href="VL2014____VL-EMPTY-NAMEFACTORY.html">vl-empty-namefactory</a>, which is occasionally useful when 
generating new modules.</p> 
 
<p>Once constructed, name factories must be used in a single-threaded 
discipline.  That is, the functions for generating names actually return 
<span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> fresh-name factory-prime)</span>, and to ensure that a sequence of 
generated names are unique, one must always use the most recently returned 
factory to generate subsequent names.</p> 
 
<p>Two functions are provided for generating names:</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-INDEXED-NAME.html">vl-namefactory-indexed-name</a> prefix nf)</span> produces a name that looks like 
<span class="v">prefix_n</span>, where <span class="v">n</span> is the smallest positive natural number <span class="v">n</span> such 
that the name <span class="v">prefix_n</span> is not in use.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-PLAIN-NAME.html">vl-namefactory-plain-name</a> name nf)</span> attempts to return <span class="v">name</span> 
verbatim.  When this is not possible, a name of the form <span class="v">name_n</span>, a note 
will be printed to standard output and instead we will produce a name with 
<span class="v">vl-namefactory-indexed-name</span>.</p> 
 
<p>We use these functions for different purposes.  We think that <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-INDEXED-NAME.html">vl-namefactory-indexed-name</a> should be used for "throwaway" names that don't 
need to be reliable or understandable, such as the names of temporary wires to 
be generated for split-up expressions.  Meanwhile, <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-PLAIN-NAME.html">vl-namefactory-plain-name</a> should be used for splitting up instance names or in 
any other cases where a reliable name is desired.</p> 
 
<p>Because name factories make use of fast alists, they should be destroyed 
with <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-FREE-NAMEFACTORY.html">vl-free-namefactory</a> nf)</span> when you are done using them.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Freshness Guarantee</h3> 
 
<p>To establish that name factories generate only fresh names, we introduce the 
function <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-ALLNAMES.html">vl-namefactory-allnames</a> nf)</span>.  This function returns a list of 
all names that the name factory currently considers to be in use.  We 
prove:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The <span class="v">allnames</span> of the empty name factory is empty.</li> 
 
<li>Every name in the <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-_E3MODNAMESPACE.html">vl-module-&gt;modnamespace</a> of <span class="v">mod</span> is among the 
<span class="v">allnames</span> of the initial name factory produced by 
<span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-STARTING-NAMEFACTORY.html">vl-starting-namefactory</a> mod).</span>
</li> 
 
<li>The <span class="v">fresh-name</span>s returned by <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-INDEXED-NAME.html">vl-namefactory-indexed-name</a> or 
<a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-PLAIN-NAME.html">vl-namefactory-plain-name</a> are not members of the <span class="v">allnames</span> of the 
input factory.</li> 
 
<li>The <span class="v">allnames</span> of the resulting <span class="v">factory-prime</span> include exactly the 
<span class="v">allnames</span> of the input <span class="v">factory</span>, along with the generated 
<span class="v">fresh-name</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Together, these theorems ensure that, when properly used, the name factory 
will only give you fresh names.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Motivation and History</h3> 
 
<p>Name generation is a surprisingly important and difficult problem.  It needs 
to be very efficient: we have sometimes found that tens of thousands of fresh 
names are needed, e.g., in <a href="VL2014____SPLIT.html">split</a>.  Toward this goal, our original 
approach was as follows:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Our generated names always looked like <span class="v">_gen_1</span>, <span class="v">_gen_2</span>, etc.</li> 
 
<li>When the first name was needed, a transform would examine the module's 
namespace for the largest <span class="v">n</span> such that <span class="v">_gen_n</span> was already in use.  The 
name <span class="v">_gen_{n+1}</span> would then be used as the first new name.</li> 
 
<li>Subsequently, any number of fresh names could then be generated by simply 
increasing the index.  That is, the second name fresh name would be 
<span class="v">_gen_{n+2}</span>, the third <span class="v">_gen_{n+3}</span>, and so on.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This scheme was highly efficient because the module's namespace only needed 
to be consulted when generating the first wire's name.  This meant that for 
large modules, generating thousands of names was not very expensive.  It also 
meant that if no fresh names were needed, then the module's namespace was never 
even computed.</p> 
 
<p>But a problem with this scheme is that the generated names are not very good 
or predictable.  This was particularly problematic when instance arrays 
like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">basic_flop data [(width - 1):0] (q, ph1, d);</pre> 
 
<p>would be transformed into something like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">basic_flop _gen_19 (q[0], ph1, d[0]);
basic_flop _gen_18 (q[1], ph1, d[1]);
basic_flop _gen_17 (q[2], ph1, d[2]);</pre> 
 
<p>that is, here the instance name <span class="v">data</span> has been entirely lost and 
replaced with a bunch of unrelated, stupid names that might easily change when 
the module is translated in the future.</p> 
 
<p>Name factories basically extend this scheme to allow much better names to be 
generated, while still being quite efficient.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Implementation</h3> 
 
<p>A name factory has two fields:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">mod</span>, the module that we are generating names for, or <span class="v">nil</span> if there 
is no such module (e.g., for empty name factories).</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">namedb</span> is an ordinary <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-P.html">vl-namedb-p</a> that we use to generate fresh 
names.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>The invariant we maintain is that either the namedb is empty, or every name 
in the <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-_E3MODNAMESPACE.html">vl-module-&gt;modnamespace</a> of <span class="v">mod</span> must be bound in it.</p>
