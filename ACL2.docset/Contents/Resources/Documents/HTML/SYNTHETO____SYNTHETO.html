<p>An ACL2 library for the Syntheto language.</p><p>Syntheto is a surface language for ACL2 and <a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a>, aimed at a wider range of users than typical ACL2 and APT experts.</p><p>Syntheto is being developed by Kestrel Institute, 
     in collaboration with Vanderbilt University.</p><p>This library includes, both under development, 
     a shallow and a deep embedding of Syntheto in ACL2.</p><p>The shallow embedding consists of ACL2 macros 
     that correspond very closely to the Syntheto abstract syntax. 
     These macros can be bidirectionally translated 
     to/from non-ACL2 representations of the Syntheto abstract syntax. 
     In particular, this is used in an IDE for Syntheto 
     that Vanderbilt University is developing 
     in collaboration with Kestrel Institute.</p><p>The deep embedding consists of a formalization of 
     the syntax and semantics of Syntheto in ACL2. 
     It serves to provide a precise definition of the language, 
     and may be useful, in the future, when developing APT-like transformations 
     that operate directly on the Syntheto language.</p>
