General Forms:
:puff* cd
(<a href="ACL2____PUFF_A2.html">puff*</a> 'cd) ; argument can be any expression evaluating to cd
(<a href="ACL2____PUFF_A2.html">puff*</a> 'cd b) ; where b is t or nil</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">cd</span> is a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor (see <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>).  See <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a> for the definition of ``puffable'' and 
 for a description of the basic act of ``puffing'' a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>. 
 <span class="v">Puff*</span> is just the recursive application of <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a>: it puffs not only 
 the indicated command, but all of the commands thus generated, and recursively 
 until none of the resulting commands can be puffed.  As noted in the 
 documentation for <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a>, <span class="v">:puff</span> should be viewed as a sort of hack; 
 hence so should <span class="v">puff*</span>.  <span class="v">Puff*</span> prints the region <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a>ed, using 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PCS.html">pcs</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Thus, to <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a> a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> is to replace it by its immediate 
 subevents, each of which is executed as a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>.  To <span class="v">puff*</span> a 
 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> is to replace the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> by each of its immediate 
 subevents and then to <span class="v">puff*</span> each of the puffable <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s among 
 the newly introduced ones.  NOTE: because one call of <span class="v">:puff*</span> may give rise 
 to many calls of <span class="v">:puff</span>, it can take considerable time for a call of 
 <span class="v">:puff*</span> to complete when many books are involved.</p> 
 
 <p>For example, suppose <span class="v">"ab"</span> is a book containing the following</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "a")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "b")</pre> 
 
 <p>Suppose that book <span class="v">"a"</span> only contained <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>s for the 
 functions <span class="v">a1</span> and <span class="v">a2</span> and that <span class="v">"b"</span> only contained <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>s for <span class="v">b1</span> and <span class="v">b2</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Now consider an ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> in which only two <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s have 
 been executed, the first being <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "ab")</span> and the second being 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "c")</span>.  Thus, the relevant part of the display produced by 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PBT.html">pbt</a></span> 1 would be:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">1 (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">INCLUDE-BOOK</a> "ab")
2 (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">INCLUDE-BOOK</a> "c")</pre> 
 
 <p>Call this <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> the ``starting <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>'' in this example, 
 because we will refer to it several times.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose <span class="v">:puff 1</span> is executed in the starting <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  Then the 
 first <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> is replaced by its immediate subevents and <span class="v">:pbt 1</span> 
 would show:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">1 (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">INCLUDE-BOOK</a> "a")
2 (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">INCLUDE-BOOK</a> "b")
3 (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">INCLUDE-BOOK</a> "c")</pre> 
 
 <p>Contrast this with the execution of <span class="v">:puff* 1</span> in the starting <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  <span class="v">Puff*</span> would first <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a> <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "ab")</span> to get 
 the <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> shown above.  But then it would recursively <span class="v">puff*</span> the 
 puffable <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s introduced by the first <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a>.  This continues 
 recursively as long as any <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a> introduced a puffable <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>. 
 The end result of <span class="v">:puff* 1</span> in the starting <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">DEFUN</a> A1 ...)
2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">DEFUN</a> A2 ...)
3 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">DEFUN</a> B1 ...)
4 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">DEFUN</a> B2 ...)
5 (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">INCLUDE-BOOK</a> "c")</pre> 
 
 <p>Observe that when <span class="v">puff*</span> is done, the originally indicated <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "ab")</span>, has been replaced by the corresponding 
 sequence of primitive <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  Observe also that puffable <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s elsewhere in the <a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a>, for example, <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> 2 in 
 the starting <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, are not affected (except that their <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> 
 numbers grow as a result of the splicing in of earlier <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Puff*</span> may cause an error, for example because of a name conflict 
 caused by two different local lemmas with the same name, or because a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> event in a book has been elided (see <a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a>).  By default, the 
 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> is reverted to its value before that execution of 
 <span class="v">puff*</span>.  However, if the optional Boolean second argument is <span class="v">t</span>, then 
 the world is preserved from the successful <span class="v">:puff</span> commands executed before 
 the failed one.  That behavior can help with debugging, since both the warning 
 message and the return value tell you which command could not be puffed 
 successfully.</p>
