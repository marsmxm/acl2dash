<p>Consequences of how parallelized proofs of subgoals are pushed for induction</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic relates to the experimental 
 extension of ACL2 supporting parallel execution and proof; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The following discussion, concerning the naming of subgoals pushed for 
 proof by induction and the timeliness of aborting when two or more goals are 
 pushed for proof by induction, only applies when waterfall parallelism is 
 enabled (see <a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>When two sibling subgoals (e.g. 4.5 and 4.6) both push goals to be proved 
 by induction (e.g., 4.6 pushes *1 and 4.5 pushes *2), a name is assigned to 
 the second pushed subgoal (e.g., *2) as if the first push hasn't happened 
 (e.g., *2 is mistakenly called *1).  In such a case, we say what the name 
 _could_ be.  The following non-theorem illustrates how this works.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a> :full)
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x)) y z) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x x y)))</pre> 
 
 <p>There is another consequence of the way the parallelized waterfall pushes 
 subgoals for proof by induction.  Without waterfall parallelism enabled, ACL2 
 sometimes decides to abort instead of pushing a goal for later proof by 
 induction, preferring instead to induct on the original conjecture.  But with 
 waterfall parallelism enabled, the prover no longer necessarily immediately 
 aborts to prove the original conjecture.  Suppose for example that sibling 
 subgoals, Subgoal 4.6 and Subgoal 4.5, each push a subgoal for induction.  If 
 the waterfall is performing the proof of each of these subgoals in parallel, 
 the proof will no longer abort immediately after the second push occurs, that 
 is at Subgoal 4.5.  As a result, the prover will continue through Subgoal 4.4, 
 Subgoal 4.3, and beyond.  It is not until the results of combining the proof 
 results of Subgoal 4.6 with the results from the remaining sibling subgoals 
 (4.5, 4.4, and so on), that the proof attempt will abort and revert to prove 
 the original conjecture by induction.  This example illustrates behavior that 
 is rather like the case that <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></span> is <span class="v">t</span>, in the sense 
 that the abort does not happen immediately, but also rather like the case that 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, in the sense that the abort does occur 
 before getting to Subgoal 3.</p>
