<p>APT (Automated Program Transformations) is a library of tools 
          to transform programs and program specifications 
          with automated support.</p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/kestrel-apt-images/apt-logo.png"></div><p>The APT transformation tools operate on ACL2 artifacts (e.g. functions) 
     and generate corresponding transformed artifacts 
     along with theorems asserting the relationship (e.g. equivalence) 
     between old and new artifacts. 
     The APT transformation tools modify the ACL2 state 
     only by submitting sound and conservative events; 
     they cannot introduce unsoundness or inconsistency on their own.</p><p>APT can be used in <i>program synthesis</i>, 
     to derive provably correct implementations from formal specifications 
     via sequences of refinement steps carried out via transformations. 
     The specifications may be declarative or executable. 
     The APT transformations can 
     synthesize executable implementations from declarative specifications, 
     as well as optimize executable specifications or implementations. 
     The APT transformations can also be used 
     to generate a variety of diverse implementations 
     of the same specification.</p><p>APT can also be used in <i>program analysis</i>, 
     to help verify existing programs, suitably embedded in the ACL2 logic, 
     by raising their level of abstraction via transformations 
     that are inverses of the ones used in stepwise program refinement. 
     The formal gap between a program and its specification 
     can be bridged by applying 
     top-down transformations to the specification 
     and bottom-up transformations to the code, 
     until they ``meet in the middle''.</p><p>APT enables the user 
     to focus on the creative parts of the program synthesis or analysis process, 
     leaving the more mechanical parts to the automation provided by the tools. 
     The user guides the process 
     by choosing which transformation to apply at each point 
     and by supplying key theorems 
     (e.g. applicability conditions of transformations), 
     while APT takes care of the lower-level, error-prone details 
     with speed and assurance.</p><p>The <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">Community Books</a> 
     currently contain only some APT transformations. 
     More transformations exist in Kestrel Institute's private files, 
     but they will be eventually moved to the Community Books.</p><p>Also see the <a href="http://www.kestrel.edu/home/projects/apt" target="_blank"><nobr>APT Project Web page<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.kestrel.edu/home/projects/apt"></nobr></a>.</p>
