<p>A record of which files we have already included that have ``proper'' 
include guards and may not need to be included again.</p><p>Header files often have the form</p> 
 
<pre class="code">`ifndef included_foo
`define included_foo
   ...
`endif</pre> 
 
<p>Or equivalently (and possibly common in legacy code since historically 
<span class="v">ifndef</span> wasn't supported by some tools):</p> 
 
<pre class="code">`ifdef included_foo
`else
   `define included_foo
   ...
`endif</pre> 
 
<p>In the typical case where <span class="v">included_foo</span> never gets undefined, it is good 
for performance to completely skip subsequent includes of such files.</p> 
 
<p>To accomplish this, we maintain an <span class="v">includeskips</span> alist, which is 
a (fast) alist binding pathnames of files that we have <span class="v">`include</span>d so far to 
<a href="VL____VL-ISKIPINFO.html">vl-iskipinfo</a>s that contain the names of their controlling define, e.g., 
<span class="v">included_foo</span> (and some additional information).</p> 
 
<p>These controlling defines should only be added to the <span class="v">includeskips</span> when 
we determine that they have the proper form.  Later, when we encounter a new 
<span class="v">`include</span>, we can check whether the file is in the <span class="v">includeskips</span> and, 
if so, whether its controlling define is still <span class="v">`define</span>d.  If so, we can 
avoid the pointless work of re-opening the file, re-reading its characters, and 
re-preprocessing them, because we know that after expanding the <span class="v">ifdefs</span>, 
the file will make no contribution to the post-preprocessed text we are 
building.</p> 
 
<p>To identify files that match the proper form, when we open a file due to an 
<span class="v">`include</span>, we check whether the file begins with one of the above, 
``proper'' include-guard formats; see <a href="VL____VL-MULTIPLE-INCLUDE-BEGIN.html">vl-multiple-include-begin</a>.  This 
identification is pretty efficient: we only have to scan initial comments, 
whitespace, and a few tokens.  If we find a proper include-guard start, we push 
a special <a href="VL____VL-IFRAME.html">vl-iframe</a>, corresponding to the <span class="v">ifndef included_foo</span>. 
This iframe is marked as <b>multiple-include candidate</b> whose controller is 
<span class="v">included_foo</span>.  We then skip until just before the <span class="v">`define</span> and resume 
preprocessing.</p> 
 
<p>We have to be careful, as we process the body of the included file, to be 
sure to remove this marking if we ever encounter an <span class="v">`else</span> or <span class="v">`elseif</span> 
that's part of the special top-level <span class="v">`ifndef</span>.  This is done in <a href="VL____VL-PROCESS-IFDEF.html">vl-process-ifdef</a> and <a href="VL____VL-PROCESS-ELSE.html">vl-process-else</a>.</p> 
 
<p>When we finally get to the <span class="v">`endif</span>, we notice in <a href="VL____VL-PROCESS-ENDIF.html">vl-process-endif</a> 
that we have a special frame.  If so, we know that (1) the start of the file 
begins with a suitable <span class="v">ifndef/define</span> pair and (2) there have been no 
<span class="v">`else</span> or <span class="v">`elseif</span> directives attached with this pair along the way. 
So, the only thing left to check is that the remainder of the file consists of 
nothing but whitespace and comments, which is easy and efficient.  If so, we're 
set: the file has the desired form, so we add it to the <span class="v">includeskips</span> 
alist.</p>
