<p>Find the rules named rune</p><pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____FIND-RULES-OF-RUNE.html">find-rules-of-rune</a> rune wrld)</pre> 
 
 <p>This function finds all the rules in <span class="v">wrld</span> with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a></span> 
 rune.  It returns a list of rules in their internal form (generally as 
 described by the corresponding <span class="v">defrec</span>).  Deciphering these rules is 
 difficult since one cannot always look at a rule object and decide what kind 
 of record it is without exploiting many system invariants (e.g., that 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> runes only name rewrite-rules).</p> 
 
 <p>At the moment this function returns <span class="v">nil</span> if the rune in question is a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REFINEMENT.html">refinement</a></span> rune, because there is no object representing 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REFINEMENT.html">refinement</a></span> rules.  (<span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REFINEMENT.html">refinement</a></span> rules cause changes 
 in the <span class="v">'coarsenings</span> properties.)  In addition, if the rune is an 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a></span> rune, then congruence rules with that rune will be 
 returned — because <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a></span> lemmas generate some 
 congruence rules — but the fact that a certain function is now known to 
 be an equivalence relation is not represented by any rule object and so no 
 such rule is returned.  (The fact that the function is an equivalence relation 
 is encoded entirely in its presence as a <span class="v">'coarsening</span> of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>.)</p>
