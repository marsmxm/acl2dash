 <p>The logic of ACL2 is based on Common Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>Common Lisp is the standard list processing programming language.  It is 
 documented in: Guy L. Steele, <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html" target="_blank"><nobr>Common Lisp 
 The Language<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html"></nobr></a>, Digital Press, 12 Crosby Drive, Bedford, MA 01730, 
 1990.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 formalizes only a subset of Common Lisp.  It includes such familiar 
 Lisp functions as <span class="v">cons</span>, <span class="v">car</span> and <span class="v">cdr</span> for creating and 
 manipulating list structures, various arithmetic primitives such as <span class="v">+</span>, 
 <span class="v">*</span>, <span class="v">expt</span> and <span class="v">&lt;=</span>, and <span class="v">intern</span> and <span class="v">symbol-name</span> for 
 creating and manipulating symbols.  Control primitives include <span class="v">cond</span>, 
 <span class="v">case</span> and <span class="v">if</span>, as well as function call, including recursion.  New 
 functions are defined with <span class="v">defun</span> and macros with <span class="v">defmacro</span>.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> for a list of the Common Lisp primitives 
 supported by ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 supports five of Common Lisp's datatypes:</p> 
 
 <p>* the precisely represented, unbounded numbers (integers, rationals, and 
 the complex numbers with rational components, called the ``complex rationals'' 
 here),</p> 
 
 <p>* the characters with ASCII codes between 0 and 255</p> 
 
 <p>* strings of such characters</p> 
 
 <p>* symbols (including packages)</p> 
 
 <p>* conses</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 is a large subset of the first-order <b>applicative</b> part of Common 
 Lisp.  (Roughly speaking, a language is applicative if it follows the rules of 
 function application.  For example, <span class="v">f(x)</span> must be equal to <span class="v">f(x)</span>, 
 which means, among other things, that the value of <span class="v">f</span> must not be affected 
 by ``global variables'' and the object <span class="v">x</span> must not change over time.)  It 
 does not support higher-order features of Common Lisp, like functional objects 
 and <span class="tt">apply</span>.  It does not support Common Lisp primitives that have 
 side-effects such as <span class="tt">setq</span>, <span class="tt">setf</span>, the Common Lisp Object 
 System, etc.  However, ACL2 does provide some special features that can be 
 used efficiently to do many of the same jobs as these omitted Common Lisp 
 primitives.  The ACL2 system is largely implemented in the language it 
 supports.</p>
