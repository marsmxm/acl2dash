<p>FGL alternative to time$ that does not get elided by rewrite rule storage.</p><p>The FGL interpreter recognizes time$ forms and prints timing 
information for the symbolic interpretation of the subterm.  However, since FGL 
is programmed mainly with rewrite rules and time$ forms are usually stripped 
out of stored rewrite rules, we provide this alternative that has the same 
effect in FGL symbolic interpretation.  It has no effect in actual execution, 
so it should just be used in rewrite rules, not in executable function 
definitions.</p>
