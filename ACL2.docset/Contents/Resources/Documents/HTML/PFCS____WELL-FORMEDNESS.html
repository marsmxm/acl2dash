<p>Well-formedness of PFCS.</p><p>A constraint in a PFCS that is not an equality, 
     i.e. that is an application of a named relation to some expressions, 
     must reference a relation that is defined in the PFCS, 
     and the number of argument expressions 
     must match the number of parameters of the named relation. 
     No two distinct relations in a PFCS may have the same name. 
     The parameters of a named relation definition must be unique.</p><p>All these well-formedness conditions are formalized here.</p>
