<p>A general utility for generating fresh names.</p><p>A <b>name database</b> allows you to easily and efficiently 
generate good, fresh names that are not being used elsewhere.</p> 
 
<p>Name databases are a general-purpose mechanism that has nothing to do with 
Verilog.  When we want to generate fresh wire names for Verilog modules, we 
usually use a <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEFACTORY-P.html">vl-namefactory-p</a> instead.  Name factories build on top of 
name databases in a way that is specific to Verilog modules, and often allow us 
to avoid constructing the list of all wire names for a module.</p> 
 
<h3>Using Name Databases</h3> 
 
<p>Typically, the user begins by constructing a name database using 
<span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-STARTING-NAMEDB.html">vl-starting-namedb</a> names)</span>, where <span class="v">names</span> are just a list of the 
names (strings) that are "in use."</p> 
 
<p>Once constructed, name databases must be used in a single-threaded 
discipline.  That is, the functions for generating names actually return <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a>
fresh-name db-prime)</span>, and to ensure that a sequence of generated names are 
unique, one must always use the most recently returned database to generate 
subsequent names.</p> 
 
<p>Two functions are provided for generating names:</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-INDEXED-NAME.html">vl-namedb-indexed-name</a> prefix db)</span> produces a name that looks like 
<span class="v">prefix_n</span>, where <span class="v">n</span> is the smallest positive natural number <span class="v">n</span> such 
that the name <span class="v">prefix_n</span> is not in use.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-PLAIN-NAME.html">vl-namedb-plain-name</a> name db)</span> attempts to return <span class="v">name</span> verbatim. 
When this is not possible, a name of the form <span class="v">name_n</span>, a note will be 
printed to standard output and instead we will produce a name with 
<span class="v">vl-namedb-indexed-name</span>.</p> 
 
<p>We use these functions for different purposes.  We think that <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-INDEXED-NAME.html">vl-namedb-indexed-name</a> should be used for "throwaway" names that don't need 
to be reliable or understandable, such as the names of temporary wires to be 
generated for split-up expressions.  Meanwhile, <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-PLAIN-NAME.html">vl-namedb-plain-name</a> 
should be used for splitting up instance names or in any other cases where a 
reliable name is desired.</p> 
 
<p>Because name databases make use of fast alists, they should be destroyed 
with <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-FREE-NAMEDB.html">vl-free-namedb</a> nf)</span> when you are done using them.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Freshness Guarantee</h3> 
 
<p>To establish that name databases generate only fresh names, we introduce the 
function <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-ALLNAMES.html">vl-namedb-allnames</a> db)</span>.  This function returns a list of all 
names that the name database currently considers to be in use.  We prove:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Every name in <span class="v">names</span> is among the <span class="v">allnames</span> of the initial name 
database produced by <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-STARTING-NAMEDB.html">vl-starting-namedb</a> names).</span>
</li> 
 
<li>The <span class="v">fresh-name</span>s returned by <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-INDEXED-NAME.html">vl-namedb-indexed-name</a> or <a href="VL2014____VL-NAMEDB-PLAIN-NAME.html">vl-namedb-plain-name</a> are not members of the <span class="v">allnames</span> of the input 
database.</li> 
 
<li>The <span class="v">allnames</span> of the resulting <span class="v">db-prime</span> include exactly the 
<span class="v">allnames</span> of the input <span class="v">db</span>, along with the generated 
<span class="v">fresh-name</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Together, these theorems ensure that, when properly used, the name database 
will only give you fresh names.</p>
