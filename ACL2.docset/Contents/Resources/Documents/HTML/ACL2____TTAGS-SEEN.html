<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____TTAGS-SEEN">Click for Ttags-seen in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>List some declared trust tags (ttags)</p><pre class="code">General Forms:
:ttags-seen
(<a href="ACL2____TTAGS-SEEN.html">ttags-seen</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>Suppose the output is as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(T NIL)
(FOO "/home/bob/bar.lisp"
     "/home/cindy/bar.lisp")
Warning: This output is minimally trustworthy (see :DOC TTAGS-SEEN).</pre> 
 
 <p>This output indicates that the current logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> has seen the 
 declaration of trust tag <span class="v">T</span> at the top-level (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>) and the 
 declaration of trust tag <span class="v">FOO</span> in the two books included from the listed 
 locations.  The warning emphasizes that this command cannot be used to 
 validate the ``purity'' of an ACL2 session, because using a ttag renders 
 enough power to hide from this or any other command the fact that the ttag was 
 ever declared.</p> 
 
 <p>As discussed elsewhere (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>), the only reliable way to 
 validate the ``purity'' of a session is to watch for ``<span class="v">TTAG NOTE</span>'' 
 output.</p> 
 
 <p>Another shortcoming of this command is that it only checks the current 
 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> for ttag declarations.  For example, one could execute a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></span> event; then use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_12.html">progn!</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a></span> to 
 replace system functions with corrupt definitions or to introduce inconsistent 
 axioms in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a></span> <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>; and finally, execute 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT_12.html">ubt!</a></span><span class="v"> 1</span> to remove all evidence of the ttag in the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> while leaving in place the corrupt definitions or axioms.  The base 
 world is now tainted, meaning we could prove <span class="v">nil</span> or certify a book that 
 proves <span class="v">nil</span>, but the resulting session or book would contain no trace of 
 the ttag that tainted it!</p> 
 
 <p>Despite shortcomings, this command might be useful to system hackers.  It 
 also serves to illustrate the inherent flaw in asking a session whether or how 
 it is ``tainted'', justifying the ``<span class="v">TTAG NOTE</span>'' approach (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>).</p>
