<p>Primitive functions for constructing <a href="ACL2____4V-SEXPRS.html">4v-sexprs</a>.</p><p>Note that all of these operations use <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a> so that 
the S-Expressions they produce are structure shared.</p> 
 
<p>These functions carry out a few trivial rewrites (constant folding, double 
negation elimination).  An open question: how much rewriting should they do? 
Right now I don't try to optimize very aggressively, e.g., <a href="ACL2____4VS-AND.html">4vs-and</a> 
doesn't eat bufs.  It's not clear how much of the code from <a href="ACL2____SEXPR-REWRITE.html">sexpr-rewrite</a> should be duplicated here.</p>
