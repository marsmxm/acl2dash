<p>Release notes for the ACL2 Community Books for ACL2 8.1</p><p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> between the releases of ACL2 8.0 and 8.1.</p> 
 
 <p>See also <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-1.html">note-8-1</a> for the changes made to ACL2 itself.  For 
 additional details, you may also see the raw <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master" target="_blank"><nobr>commit log<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>New Libraries</h3> 
 
 <p>A new regular expression library, <a href="ACRE____ACRE.html">acre::acre</a>, is available in 
 <span class="v">books/centaur/acre/</span>.  Compared to the implementation in 
 <span class="v">projects/regex</span>, this version's features are less similar to GNU grep and 
 somewhat more similar to Perl regular expressions.  However, it does not aim 
 to be fully compatible, but to have a well-defined set of features with clean 
 code that can be easily extended and behaves predictably (as much as possible, 
 for regular expressions).</p> 
 
 <p>Added PLTP(A), The Pure Lisp Theorem Prover, reimplemented in ACL2.  An 
 ACL2 reconstruction of the 1973 Pure Lisp Theorem Prover (PLTP), the original 
 ``Boyer-Moore theorem prover'' after which both NQTHM and ACL2 were modeled, 
 is available in <span class="v">books/projects/pltpa/pltpa.lisp</span>.  More importantly, a <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/best-ideas/pltp/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>PLTP 
 archive<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/best-ideas/pltp/index.html"></nobr></a> has been set up.  That archive includes much original source 
 material (e.g., scanned images of the 1973 POP-2 implementation of PLTP) as 
 well as an extensive discussion of the differences between PLTP and PLTP(A), 
 and an OCaml version of PLTP, named PLTA(O), by Grant Passmore.</p> 
 
 <p>A new directory, <span class="v">books/projects/arm/</span>, contains proofs of correctness 
 of the Floating-point operations of addition, multiplication, fused 
 multiply-add, division, and square root, as implemented in the FPU of an Arm 
 Cortex-A class high-end processor.</p> 
 
 <p>Added utility <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK-PATHS.html">include-book-paths</a> to list paths via <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> down to a given book, which may be useful for reducing book 
 dependencies.</p> 
 
 <p>Added utility <a href="ACL2____APPLY-FN-IF-KNOWN.html">apply-fn-if-known</a> to apply a function that might not 
 exist; even the package for the function symbol might not exist.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a fixer <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTEGER-RANGE-FIX.html">integer-range-fix</a></span> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTEGER-RANGE-P.html">integer-range-p</a></span>, as 
 well as a recognizer <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTEGER-RANGE-LISTP.html">integer-range-listp</a></span> and and a fixer <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTEGER-RANGE-LIST-FIX.html">integer-range-list-fix</a></span> for true lists of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTEGER-RANGE-P.html">integer-range-p</a></span>, all with 
 accompanying theorems.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a <a href="ACL2____DIGITS-ANY-BASE.html">library</a> to convert 
 between natural numbers and their representations as lists of digits in 
 arbitrary bases in big-endian and little-endian order.  Digits are natural 
 numbers below the base.  There are variants for minimum-length, 
 non-zero-minimum-length, and specified-length lists of digits.  The library 
 includes, among others, theorems stating that the number-to-digits and 
 digits-to-number conversions are mutual inverses in a suitable sense.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a new utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-IN-BOOK.html">skip-in-book</a></span>, that wraps around a form to 
 prevent its evaluation during book certification or inclusion.</p> 
 
 <p>The new utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM_C3W.html">defthm&lt;w</a></span> will attempt to prove a theorem directly 
 from previously-proved theorems.  It does this by generating suitable <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> using the new utility, <a href="ACL2____PREVIOUS-SUBSUMER-HINTS.html">previous-subsumer-hints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added some utilities for building XDOC documentation.  The <a href="XDOC____CONSTRUCTORS.html">XDOC constructors</a> are utilities to 
 construct well-tagged XDOC strings via ACL2 function calls whose nesting 
 structure mirrors the nesting of the XML.  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC_B2.html">defxdoc+</a></span> extends <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a></span> with additional conveniences.</p> 
 
 <p>A new event, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUNT.html">defunt</a></span>, is a variant of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> that uses 
 termination theorems from a large set of <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> — 
 namely, all books included in <span class="v">books/doc/top.lisp</span>, which is the book that 
 creates the ACL2+Books manual — to generate termination proofs 
 automatically.  Those proofs use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMINATION-THEOREM.html">termination-theorem</a></span> <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>s that reference <span class="v">defun</span> events in those included books. 
 Several new supporting utilities are documented: <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMS_12-LST.html">fms!-lst</a></span>, which 
 writes a list to a character output channel; <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INJECTIONS.html">injections</a></span>, which lists 
 all maps from a domain to a range; <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STRICT-MERGE-SORT-_C3.html">strict-merge-sort-&lt;</a></span>, which sorts without 
 duplicates; and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SUBSETP-EQ-LINEAR.html">subsetp-eq-linear</a></span>, which is a linear-time subset test 
 for sorted lists of symbols.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a new macro <span class="v">defbyte</span> for introducing fixtypes for unsigned and 
 signed bytes of specified sizes, as well as fixtypes of lists of such bytes, 
 along with theorems relating the fixtype recognizers to the built-in binary 
 predicates <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">signed-byte-p</a></span> and to the 
 library binary predicates <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-LISTP.html">unsigned-byte-listp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-LISTP.html">signed-byte-listp</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Started a new library for <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Ethereum<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://ethereum.org"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Started a new library for <a href="https://bitcoin.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Bitcoin<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://bitcoin.org"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new book, <span class="v">clause-processors/bindinglist.lisp</span>, supports a meta-level 
 structure for a list of bindings of variables to values, with functions that 
 convert these to and from nests of lambdas and proofs that establish these 
 functions' semantics with respect to an evaluator.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes to Existing Libraries</h3> 
 
 <p>The behavior and code for the expander (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTHM_F3.html">defthm?</a>) have been 
 improved in a few ways (some of them technical), as follows.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>A bug has been fixed that was preventing <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> from being passed to 
 the forcing round (if any).  An example may be found in the new book, 
 <span class="v">misc/expander-tests.lisp</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The deprecated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span> directives <span class="v">~p</span> and <span class="v">~q</span> have been 
 replaced by <span class="v">~x</span> and <span class="v">~y</span>, respectively.</li> 
 
 <li>Error messages have been improved for the function <span class="v">simplify-hyps</span> when 
 there is a contradiction.</li> 
 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> globals <span class="v">tool2-result</span> and <span class="v">tool2-error</span> are no 
 longer set.  (They appear to have been unused.)</li> 
 
 <li>The functions <span class="v">tool2-fn</span>, <span class="v">tool2-fn-lst</span>, and <span class="v">simplify-hyps</span> now 
 have a new final argument, <span class="v">ctx</span>.  Also, the macro <span class="v">tool2</span> now has a 
 <span class="v">:ctx</span> keyword argument.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Updated the ACL2+books manual to accommodate the replacement of David 
 Russinoff's online rtl manual by his upcoming Springer book.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED.html">install-not-normalized</a></span> to handle cases in which 
 recursively-defined functions have non-recursive normalized definitions.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">misc/assert.lisp</span> book no longer includes <span class="v">misc/eval.lisp</span>, 
 since tests about the <span class="v">misc/assert.lisp</span> utilities are now in a separate 
 book <span class="v">misc/assert-tests.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">misc/eval.lisp</span> utilities <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENSURE-ERROR.html">ensure-error</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENSURE-SOFT-ERROR.html">ensure-soft-error</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENSURE-HARD-ERROR.html">ensure-hard-error</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM_F3.html">thm?</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NOT-THM_F3.html">not-thm?</a></span>  have been renamed to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL-WITH-ERROR.html">must-fail-with-error</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL-WITH-SOFT-ERROR.html">must-fail-with-soft-error</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL-WITH-HARD-ERROR.html">must-fail-with-hard-error</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-PROVE.html">must-prove</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-NOT-PROVE.html">must-not-prove</a></span>.  The old names are still available as 
 deprecated synonyms, which will be removed in one of the next releases.</p> 
 
 <p>The old directory <span class="v">books/projects/masc/</span> has been replaced by the bew 
 directory<span class="v">books/projects/rac/</span>.  The reason is that our RTL modeling 
 language now uses the register class templates of Algorithm C instead of those 
 of SystemC, so the name <i>Modeling Algorithms in SystemC</i> now makes even 
 less sense than it did; the best we could come up with as a replacement is 
 <i>Restricted Algorithmic C</i>. </p> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-FLAG.html">make-flag</a></span> has a new keyword argument, <span class="v">:last-body</span>, 
 to specify using the most recent <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> rule for a function symbol 
 instead of its original definition.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended and simplified the <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK-QUERIES.html"><span class="v">defun-sk</span> query utilities</a>.  The utilities now 
 handle the recently introduced <span class="v">:constrain</span> option.  The utilities no 
 longer build a record with all the information about the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> 
 function (whose fields can then be accessed); instead, now the utilities 
 retrieve the various pieces of information directly.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the <a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE-QUERIES.html"><span class="v">defchoose</span> query 
 utilities</a> with a recognizer for symbols that name <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> 
 functions.</p> 
 
 <p>Made several improvements to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DIRECTED-UNTRANSLATE.html">directed-untranslate</a></span>, including: avoid 
 assertion errors that could occur when using <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> forms with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> expressions: enhance insertion of 
 appropriate <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> calls; extend dropping of unused <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> bindings; 
 avoid an assertion error with <span class="v">mv-let</span> expressions; and preserve basic uses 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Removed the <span class="v">keywords-of-keyword-value-list</span> utility, because it is 
 subsumed by the built-in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EVENS.html">evens</a></span> utility.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the <a href="ACL2____ERROR-CHECKING.html">error-checking 
 utilities</a> with several error-checking functions.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the Kestrel world query utilities with functions to collect the 
 names of all the known packages in the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and to check if a 
 function is primitive.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the <a href="ACL2____STD_F2SYSTEM_F2TERM-FUNCTION-RECOGNIZERS.html">term 
 function recognizers</a> with recognizers for true lists of 
 (pseudo-)lambda-expressions and (pseudo-)term-functions.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the Kestrel term utilities with operations to substitute function 
 symbols without performing simplification, to construct terms that are 
 functions applications of certain forms, to collect all the lambda expressions 
 in terms, and to collect all the package names in (symbols in) terms.</p> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED-EVENT.html">install-not-normalized-event</a></span> now includes option 
 <span class="v">:allp nil</span> in the generated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED.html">install-not-normalized</a></span> event.  The new 
 utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED-EVENT-LST.html">install-not-normalized-event-lst</a></span>, can thus handle <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> nicely, e.g.: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED-EVENT-LST.html">install-not-normalized-event-lst</a> (<a href="ACL2____GETPROPC.html">getpropc</a>
 'f1 'recursivep nil) nil nil (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span>.  Also, added new utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED_42.html">install-not-normalized$</a></span> to submit the event generated by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED-EVENT.html">install-not-normalized-event</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the <a href="SET____OSET-UTILITIES.html">oset utilities</a> 
 with a <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fixtype</a> for osets.</p> 
 
 <p>Added some <a href="ACL2____NAT-LIST-FIX-THEOREMS.html">theorems about lists 
 of natural numbers</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a theorem about lists of strings.</p> 
 
 <p>Merged the utilities in <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/characters.lisp</span> into 
 the <a href="ACL2____STRING-UTILITIES.html">string utilities</a>.  Extended the 
 combined utilities with some theorems about the pre-existing functions and 
 with new functions to check if (lists of) characters are all of specified 
 kinds, to convert a list of unsigned 8-bit bytes to a corresponding list or 
 string of hex digit characters.  Refactored all the old and new utilities into 
 separate files to reduce dependencies.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the Kestrel symbol utilities with a utility that lifts <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> to lists.</p> 
 
 <p>Moved <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAYBE-MSGP.html">maybe-msgp</a></span> under newly created <a href="ACL2____MESSAGE-UTILITIES.html">message utilities</a>.  Extended these utilities with a 
 recognizer of true lists of messages.</p> 
 
 <p>Moved <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSG-DOWNCASE-FIRST.html">msg-downcase-first</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSG-UPCASE-FIRST.html">msg-upcase-first</a></span> from the <a href="ACL2____STRING-UTILITIES.html">string utilities</a> to the <a href="ACL2____MESSAGE-UTILITIES.html">message utilities</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new book, <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/proof-builder-macros.lisp</span>, is a place to 
 define <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> macros.  This book currently defines a simple 
 macro, <span class="v">when-not-proved</span> (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2-PC____WHEN-NOT-PROVED.html">ACL2-pc::when-not-proved</a></span>), for 
 skipping instructions when all goals have been proved.  It also defines two 
 (more complex) macros, <span class="v">prove-guard</span> (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2-PC____PROVE-GUARD.html">ACL2-pc::prove-guard</a></span>) and 
 <span class="v">prove-termination</span> (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2-PC____PROVE-TERMINATION.html">ACL2-pc::prove-termination</a></span>), for 
 (respectively) using previously-proved <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> or termination theorems 
 efficiently, as well as a more general macro, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2-PC____FANCY-USE.html">ACL2-pc::fancy-use</a></span>, for 
 using lemma instances (via <span class="v">:use</span>) efficiently.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the <span class="v">copy-def</span> utility (community book 
 <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/copy-def.lisp</span>) in several ways: added an <span class="v">:expand</span> 
 hint in the recursive case (as is sometimes necessary), improved it to work 
 better with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span>, and improved it to work better with an 
 <span class="v">:equiv</span> argument.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed the utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ORELSE.html">orelse</a></span>, so that <span class="v">:quiet t</span> pushes the output 
 stack, as per existing documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a few books that broke due to the change in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a></span> (see 
 <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-1.html">note-8-1</a> for details).</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="SOFT____SOFT.html">SOFT</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added a <span class="v">:print</span> option to control screen output.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved user input validation.</p> 
 
 <p>Added support for the new <span class="v">:constrain</span> option of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span>.  This 
 option is now supported by SOFT's <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFUN-SK2.html">soft::defun-sk2</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFUN-INST.html">soft::defun-inst</a></span> macros.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____X86ISA.html">X86ISA</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Most of the model has been extended to 32-bit mode.  The only instructions 
 that remain to be extended to 32-bit mode are JMP far and the floating-point 
 instructions.  The 32-bit-only instructions PUSHA, POPA, INC with opcodes 
 40h-47h, DEC with opcodes 48h-4Fh, and PUSH CS/SS/DS/ES have been added to the 
 model.  Support for the kinds of paging in 32-bit mode is still missing, but 
 this is only needed for the system view of the model, not the application 
 view.</p> 
 
 <p>Some of the XDOC documentation and some of the comments have been slightly 
 expanded.</p> 
 
 <p>The notion of programmer-level mode and system-level mode have been renamed 
 to `application-level view' and `system-level view', to avoid overloading the 
 word `mode', which in the x86 has a more specific meaning.  Similarly, the 
 notion of page structure marking mode has been renamed `marking view'.  This 
 involved renaming the <span class="v">programmer-level-mode</span> and 
 <span class="v">page-structure-marking-mode</span> field of the state stobj to the shorter 
 <span class="v">app-view</span> and <span class="v">marking-view</span>, and also renaming some functions and 
 theorems acccordingly.</p> 
 
 <p>The instruction decoder has been extended to detect VEX- and EVEX-encoded 
 (AVX, AVX2, AVX512) instructions, in both 64- and 32-bit modes of operation. 
 However, semantic functions of many of these instructions are still 
 unimplemented.</p> 
 
 <p>Annotated opcode maps are now used to generate opcode dispatch functions 
 and instruction coverage information.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Improved documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved options to control the screen output.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved <span class="tt"><a href="APT____TAILREC.html">apt::tailrec</a></span> transformation with an option to attempt to 
 automatically infer the domain for some of the transformation's applicability 
 conditions.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved <span class="tt"><a href="APT____RESTRICT.html">apt::restrict</a></span> transformation to wrap the restriction test 
 with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBT.html">mbt</a></span>; added an applicability condition to ensure that the 
 restriction test is boolean-valued.</p> 
 
 <p>Imported more symbols from the <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> package into the <span class="v">"APT"</span> 
 package.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____BITOPS.html">Bitops</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added the <a href="BITOPS____SPARSEINT.html">bitops::sparseint</a> library, which represents large integers 
 as balanced binary trees, which can save memory by sharing structure among many 
 such objects.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____SV.html">SV</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Improved scalability of several SV utilities when large variables are present 
 by recoding several functions that previously used Lisp bignums to use a 
 <a href="BITOPS____SPARSEINT.html">bitops::sparseint</a> based encoding.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____GL.html">GL</a></h4> 
 <p>Added optional accumulated-persistence-style profiling of attempted rule 
 applications, available with keyword argument <span class="v">:prof-enabledp t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Changed the representation of symbolic objects, removing the <span class="v">:g-number</span> 
 form which could represent complex rationals and replacing it with a simpler 
 <span class="v">:g-integer</span> form.  (Complex rationals may still be supported using 
 rewriting.  Also, the <span class="v">:g-number</span> shape specifier is still supported for 
 backward compatibility, though it is restricted to only represent integers and 
 translates directly into <span class="v">:g-integer</span> symbolic objects.)  Removed some 
 native symbolic counterparts for functions that can be dealt with more cleanly 
 via rewrite rules.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="GL____GLMC.html">GLMC</a></h4> 
 <p>Added option to bind some variables that can be used by the nextstate, property, 
 constraint, and initstate terms.  These bindings will be symbolically evaluated once, 
 which can perhaps improve performance by not requiring them to be repeated.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">Xdoc</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added a utility, <a href="XDOC____ARCHIVE-XDOC.html">xdoc::archive-xdoc</a>, that saves the documentation 
 generated by a series of local events, partially preprocessing it to avoid 
 references to definitions that might only be locally available.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPOINTER.html">defpointer</a></span> utility for <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> now accepts names that have 
 special characters such as <span class="v">&lt;</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STD.html">STD</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">std/typed-lists/unsigned-byte-listp.lisp</span> book now includes 
  <span class="v">std/lists/take</span> locally. As a result, 
  <span class="v">projects/x86isa/tools/execution/exec-loaders/mach-o/mach-o-reader.lisp</span>, 
  <span class="v">std/io/take-bytes.lisp</span>, <span class="v">unicode/read-utf8.lisp</span>, and 
  <span class="v">unicode/utf8-decode.lisp</span> also include this book locally.</p> 
 
 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3> 
 
 <h3>Build System Updates</h3> 
 
 <p>The build system now has support for <a href="ACL2____IFDEF.html">ifdef</a> and <a href="ACL2____IFNDEF.html">ifndef</a>, which 
 are <a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>-supported macros defined in <span class="v">books/build/ifdef.lisp</span>. 
 In particular, this allows the community books' makefile to support building 
 different versions of the manual depending what external tools are 
 installed.</p> 
 
 <h3>Testing</h3> 
 
 <h3>Miscellaneous</h3> 
 
 <p>A BibTeX file has been added to the community books, containing reference 
 information for papers published at the ACL2 Workshops.  This may be useful to 
 you if you wish to cite such a paper in a LaTeX document.  It is available at 
 <span class="v">books/workshops/references/</span>.  That directory also contains an example

 <p>A Developer's Guide (see <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE.html">developers-guide</a>) has been added, to assist 
 those who may wish to become ACL2 Developers.  It replaces the much smaller 
 ``system-development'' topic.</p>

 <p>When the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-RAW.html">include-raw</a></span> utility with option <span class="v">:do-not-compile t</span> was 
 followed by <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span>, it was possible for that subsequent 
 compilation to overwrite intended raw Lisp definitions, for a host Lisp that 
 does not compile on-the-fly (i.e., for a host Lisp other than CCL or SBCL). 
 The way to prevent such overwrites is to extend <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> globals 
 <span class="v">program-fns-with-raw-code</span> and <span class="v">logic-fns-with-raw-code</span>, which however 
 was not always done.  This is now done automatically, which fixes the 
 overwrite problem.</p>
