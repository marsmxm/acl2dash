<p>Enable some rewrite rules for use in FGL</p><p>Adds the given rewrite rule runes to the <span class="v">fgl-rewrite-rules</span> table so 
that each such rule will be attempted when terms with its LHS's leading 
function symbol is encountered.  The exact form of the rule that is used 
depends on the invocation: if a name given is simply a symbol, then the formula 
of that theorem or function name is used.  If a name is instead a <span class="v">:rewrite</span> 
or <span class="v">:definition</span> rune, then the corresponding lemma is used.  A 
<span class="v">:formula</span> rune (which is not a valid ACL2 rune but is a valid FGL rune) is 
treated the same as a bare symbol.</p>
