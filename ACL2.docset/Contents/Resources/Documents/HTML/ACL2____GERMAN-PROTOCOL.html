<p>An ACL2 proof of coherence of the German Cache Protocol.  The 
protocol is translated directly into ACL2 from the murphy code provided in 
ccp.m.  The proof involves formalizing coherence and strengthening the property 
into an inductive invariant.</p><p>The directory <span class="v">projects/concurrent-programs/german-protocol</span> 
contains the ACL2 source files for the German Protocol proof by Sandip Ray. 
These ACL2 books may be built by running, e.g., <span class="v">make concurrent-programs</span> 
from the <span class="v">books/</span> directory.</p> 
 
<p>This set of books define an invariant that is strong enough to verify the 
coherence of the German Cache Protocol.  The proof shows how to come up with a 
sufficient inductive invariant by iterative strengthening starting from the 
desired base property.  The proof also demonstrates how to define invariant 
predicates for multiprocess systems both using quantification over process 
indices and recursive functions, thus providing a tutorial demonstration of how 
to reason about concurrent protocols.</p> 
 
<h3>Background and Description</h3> 
 
<p>Anna Slobodova gave this problem to the author when she was looking for 
doing cache protocol proofs with ACL2.  The key is that some predicates 
involved, especially the key coherence property, could be naturally stated as 
quantified formulas, and the question was how we could use the standard 
quantification approaches together with (possibly) recursive functions to 
derive a proof in the way the human would do.</p> 
 
<p>I looked at the protocol and decided to do a proof on my own of the protocol 
in ACL2.  Previously a similar proof was done in ACL2 via predicate 
abstraction, and this proof was primarily intended to show how predicate 
abstraction could save labor over a standard ACL2 proof.  However, the ACL2 
proof itself was not devoid of interest, since it showed how one typically 
iterates over a partial invariant to define a concrete inductive invariant for 
a protocol-level system.  The proof did spring some surprises, for instance as 
documented in the definition of some fragments of the invariant required in the 
proof.</p> 
 
<p>However, the chief contribution of the proof is to provide a tutorial 
introduction to coming up with an inductive invariant for a complicated 
multiprocess protocol.  Towards this end, substantial on-the-fly commentary of 
the proof is provided in the form of comments, documenting the thought process 
involved in the proof.</p>
