<p>Discussion on how to use unsigned-byte-p</p><p><a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">Unsigned-byte-p</a> (and <a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">signed-byte-p</a> for that matter) are 
  tricky enough that there is no one-size-fits-all solution that everyone 
  should use to reason about them.  Depending on your problem you might try any 
  of these strategies:</p> 
 
  <ol> 
 
  <li>
<i>Arithmetic</i> -- Leave unsigned-byte-p's regular definition enabled 
  and try to reason about the resulting inequalities.  This sometimes works and 
  may be a good approach if you have goals involving "non bit-vector 
  functions" like +, *, /, etc.  I usually don't use this approach but I 
  haven't done a lot of proofs about true arithmetic functions.</li> 
 
  <li>
<i>Induction</i> -- Disable unsigned-byte-p's regular definition but 
  instead enable an alternate definition, e.g., the 
  centaur/bitops/ihsext-basics book has unsigned-byte-p**, which is a recursive 
  version that works well for induction.  This definition is in the 
  ihsext-recursive-redefs ruleset and also works well with other ** definitions 
  like logand**.  This is often a good strategy when proving lemmas about 
  unsigned-byte-p but is probably mainly useful when reasoning about new 
  recursive functions.</li> 
 
  <li>
<i>Vector</i> -- Leave <a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> disabled except to prove 
  lemmas, and expect to reason about (unsigned-byte-p n x) via lemmas.  I think 
  I usually prefer this strategy as it feels more reliable/less magical than 
  reasoning about arithmetic inequalities.  Some useful books: 
 
    <ol> 
 
      <li>bitops/ihsext-basics proves the nice/obvious lemmas about 
      signed/unsigned-byte-p on many bit-vector functions like logior, 
      logand, etc.</li> 
 
      <li>bitops/signed-byte-p has lemmas about signed/unsigned-byte-p for 
      some arithmetic functions (+, -, *) and also extended lemmas about 
      bit-vector stuff.  It's often very handy for the kinds of guard 
      obligations that arise from things like (the (unsigned-byte 32) 
      x).</li> 
 
    </ol>
</li> 
  </ol> 
 
  <p>We have occasionally written wrapper functions like <span class="v">u32p</span>, but, I 
  think that perhaps the only reason we did this was for macros like <a href="ACL2____DEF-TYPED-RECORD.html">def-typed-record</a>, where we needed a unary predicate to introduce a fancier 
  data structure.  Once we had the typed records in place, we just enabled 
  these wrappers and did all our reasoning about <a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a>. 
  (I don't think you'd want to reason about a each various u32p, u64p, etc., 
  individually.)</p> 
 
  <p>In the context of FTY, I don't think you need wrappers, but if for some 
  reason you do want to use them then that is probably basically fine.  Note 
  here that you have some choice for your fixing function.  You can fix to 0 as 
  you've done in your examples, but you might instead prefer to fix to 
  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a> n x)</span>.  Why?  When you use loghead, it preserves the lower <span class="v">N</span> 
  bits, and this may interact much more nicely with rules about true bit-vector 
  functions.  This approach is also good for GL, where loghead is supported in 
  an especially good way.</p> 
 
  <p>That said, it should be possible to get by without wrappers; see for 
  instance the definition of sizednum in centaur/fty/deftypes-tests.lisp, or 
  the definition of vl-constint in centaur/vl/expr.lisp, both of which use a 
  loghead-based approach to do the fixing.  (The vl-constint example has 
  a :require that is an inequality instead of an unsigned-byte-p term, but I 
  don't think there's any particular reason to do it this way instead of the 
  other.)</p> 
 
  <p>In general there is good reason to expect it to sometimes be hard to work 
  with unsigned-byte-p.  For instance, consider a theorem like the following, 
  from <span class="v">centaur/bitops/signed-byte-p.lisp</span>:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> lousy-unsigned-byte-p-of-*-mixed
  ;; Probably won't ever unify with anything.
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> n1 a)
                (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> n2 b))
           (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> n1 n2) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> a b)))
  :hints(("Goal" :use ((:instance upper-bound)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>This would be a good rule to try on goals like <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 10 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> a
  b))</span>, but without some insight into <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">b</span> it's hard to know how 
  to successfully instantiate <span class="v">N1/N2</span>.  So you end up resorting to <span class="v">:use</span> 
  hints, or special-case variants of this theorem (e.g., another theorem that 
  says 7 bits * 3 bits --&gt; 10 bits), or you do something more sophisticated 
  with bind-free or similar.</p> 
 
  <p>If you find yourself going down this road, you might see in particular Dave 
  Greve's "Parameterized Congruences" paper from the 2006 workshop, which is 
  implemented in the coi/nary/nary.lisp book.  You could also look at Sol 
  Swords' book to do something similar, see <a href="ACL2____CONTEXTUAL-REWRITING.html">contextual-rewriting</a>.</p>
