<p>Parsing for Verilog-2005 ports.</p><p>In Verilog-2005, a <span class="v">port_expression</span> is just a syntactic means 
to restrict the expressions allowed in ports to identifiers, bit-selects, 
part-selects, and concatenations.  We just parse <span class="v">port_expression</span>s into 
plain expressions.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">port_expression ::= port_reference
                  | '{' port_reference { ',' port_reference } '}'

port_reference ::= identifier [ '[' constant_range_expression ']' ]

constant_range_expression ::= constant_expression
                            | msb_constant_expression : lsb_constant_expression</pre> 
 
<p>Port expressions are put into lists with the following rules.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">list_of_ports ::= '(' port { ',' port } ')'

port ::= [port_expression]
       | '.' identifier '(' [port_expression] ')'</pre> 
 
<p>Note that the above rules allow null ports, e.g., <span class="v">module foo ( a, , b
)</span>.  As described in 12.3.2, the port expression is optional to allow for 
ports that do not connect to anything internal to the module.</p> 
 
<p>If we were to interpret the grammar very literally, the <span class="v">list_of_ports</span> 
for <span class="v">module foo ()</span> would be a singleton list with a blank port.  But in 
light of the way module instances work, e.g., see <a href="VL2014____SPECIAL-NOTE-ABOUT-BLANK-PORTS.html">special-note-about-blank-ports</a>, it seems like the nicest way to handle this is 
to instead allow an empty list of ports, and treat <span class="v">()</span> as producing the 
empty list of ports instead of a single blank port.</p>
