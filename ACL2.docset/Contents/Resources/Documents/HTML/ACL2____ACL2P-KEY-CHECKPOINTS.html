<p>Key checkpoints in ACL2(p)</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic relates to the experimental 
 extension of ACL2 supporting parallel execution and proof; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For printing output, the parallel version of the waterfall follows the 
 precedent of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a></span>.  The idea behind gag mode is to print only the 
 subgoals most relevant to debugging a failed proof attempt.  These subgoals 
 are called 'key checkpoints' (see <a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> for the definition of 
 ``key'' and ``checkpoint''), and we restrict the default output mode for the 
 parallel version of the waterfall to printing checkpoints similar to these key 
 checkpoints.</p> 
 
 <p>As of this writing, we are aware of exactly one discrepancy between gag 
 mode's key checkpoints and the parallel version of the waterfall's 
 checkpoints.  This discrepancy occurs when using ``by'' hints (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>).  As an example, take the following form, which attempts to prove a 
 non-theorem:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y z) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> z (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> y x)))
     :hints (("Subgoal *1/2'''" :by nil)))</pre> 
 
 <p>With waterfall parallelism enabled, <span class="v">Subgoal *1/2''</span> will be printed as 
 a key checkpoint.  This is different from using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a></span> while running 
 the serial version of the waterfall, which skips printing the subgoal as a 
 checkpoint.</p> 
 
 <p>For those familiar with the ACL2 waterfall, we note that the parallel 
 version of the waterfall prints key checkpoints that are unproved in the 
 following sense: a subgoal is a key checkpoint if it leads, in the current 
 call of the waterfall, to a goal that is pushed for induction.</p>
