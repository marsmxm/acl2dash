<p>ATJ tutorial: Deep and Shallow Embedding Approaches.</p><p>This tutorial page provides an introduction to 
    the main code generation options provided by ATJ, 
    namely the choice between the deep and shallow embedding approach.</p><h5>Comparison between Deep and Shallow Embedding</h5><p>Translating ACL2 to Java involves 
    not only <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-ACL2-VALUES.html">representing the ACL2 values in Java</a> but also representing the ACL2 language constructs 
    (function definitions, conditionals, etc.) 
    in Java in some way so that they can be executed in Java. 
    There are generally two approaches 
    to representing a language in another language: 
    deep embedding and shallow embedding. 
    ATJ supports both.</p><p>In the deep embedding approach, 
    both the syntax and (evaluation) semantics of ACL2 
    are represented explicitly in Java. 
    There are Java data structures 
    that correspond to the ACL2 language constructs, 
    and there is Java code that executes these constructs 
    consistently with ACL2's semantics. 
    In other words, 
    there is an interpreter of the ACL2 language 
    written in the Java language.</p><p>In the shallow embedding approach, 
    there is no such explicit representation 
    of ACL2's syntax and (evaluation) semantics in Java. 
    Instead, the ACL2 constructs are mapped to Java constructs 
    in a way that Java's semantics corresponds to ACL2's semantics.</p><h5>ATJ's Support for Deep and Shallow Embedding</h5><p>Compilers and code generators 
    normally follow the shallow embedding approach. 
    ATJ's initial version supported the deep embedding approach, 
    because of its simplicity and assurance. 
    ATJ's later versions added the shallow embedding approach, 
    which provides more readable and performant Java code. 
    The shallow embedding is the preferred approach, 
    but support for the deep embedding has been retained 
    and there are no plans to remove it.</p><p>In the following manual pages, 
    first we describe the deep embedding approach, 
    because it is simple 
    and because some of the concepts also apply 
    to the shallow embedding approach.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Previous:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-ACL2-VALUES.html">Java Representation of the ACL2 Values</a></p><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-DEEP.html">Deep Embedding Approach</a></p>
