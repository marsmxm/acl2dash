General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____GENERALIZE.html">generalize</a> &amp;rest substitution)</pre> 
 
 <p>Generalize using the indicated substitution, which should be a non-empty 
 list.  Each element of that list should be a two-element list of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> variable)</span>, where <span class="v">term</span> may use abbreviations.  The effect of 
 the instruction is to replace each such term in the current goal by the 
 corresponding variable.  This replacement is carried out by a parallel 
 substitution, outside-in in each hypothesis and in the conclusion.  More 
 generally, actually, the ``variable'' (second) component of each pair may be 
 <span class="v">nil</span> or a number, which causes the system to generate a new name of the 
 form <span class="v">_</span> or <span class="v">_n</span>, with <span class="v">n</span> a natural number; more on this below. 
 However, when a variable is supplied, it must not occur in any goal of the 
 current state of the interactive proof-builder.</p> 
 
 <p>When the ``variable'' above is <span class="v">nil</span>, the system will treat it as the 
 variable <span class="v">|_|</span> if that variable does not occur in any goal of the current 
 proof-builder state.  Otherwise it treats it as <span class="v">|_0|</span>, or <span class="v">|_1|</span>, or 
 <span class="v">|_2|</span>, and so on, until one of these is not among the variables of the 
 current proof-builder state.  If the ``variable'' is a non-negative integer 
 <span class="v">n</span>, then the system treats it as <span class="v">|_n|</span> unless that variable already 
 occurs among the current goals, in which case it increments n just as above 
 until it obtains a new variable.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> The same variable may not occur as the variable component of 
 two different arguments (though <span class="v">nil</span> may occur arbitrarily many times, as 
 may a positive integer).</p>
