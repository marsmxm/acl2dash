<p>Algorithms for choosing "better" (smaller) AIGs.</p><p>Given two AIGs, A and B, we say that A is "better" than B if:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>A has fewer unique AND nodes than B, or</li> 
 <li>A,B have the same number of unique AND nodes, but A has fewer 
       total nodes than B.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>We provide two main functions for choosing good AIGs:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<a href="ACL2____AIG-LIST-BEST.html">aig-list-best</a> chooses the best AIG from a non-empty list of 
AIGs.</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="ACL2____AIG-LIST-LIST-BEST.html">aig-list-list-best</a> is given a list of non-empty AIG Lists, say 
<span class="v">(L1 L2 ... Ln)</span>, and returns <span class="v">(B1 B2 ... Bn)</span>, where each <span class="v">Bi</span> is the 
best AIG from the corresponding <span class="v">Li</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>You could just implement <a href="ACL2____AIG-LIST-LIST-BEST.html">aig-list-list-best</a> as an ordinary "map" or 
projection of <a href="ACL2____AIG-LIST-BEST.html">aig-list-best</a>.  But <span class="v">aig-list-list-best</span> is written in 
a slightly smarter way than this, so that it can share the labels and 
memoization results across all of the AIGs in all of the lists.</p> 
 
<h3>Implementation</h3> 
 
<p>It is tricky to directly count "unique nodes" in a memoized way, but there 
is a very easy way to do it indirectly.</p> 
 
<p>First, we assign a number to every unique AIG node in sight, which (assuming 
constant-time hashing) is linear in the sizes of the input AIGs.  We call these 
numbers labels.</p> 
 
<p>Next, we can write memoized functions to gather the sets of labels for all 
of the AND nodes within an AIG, and similarly for all of the nodes.  We just 
use regular ordered sets to represent these sets.  Importantly, these 
collection functions can be easily memoized.</p> 
 
<p>Finally, to count the number of ANDs (or all nodes) in an AIG, we just 
collect the labels for its ANDs (or all nodes) and see how many labels were 
found.</p> 
 
<p>BOZO it would probably be much better to use <a href="ACL2____SBITSETS.html">sbitsets</a> to represent 
label sets.  If we ever need to speed this up, that's probably the first thing 
to try.</p>
