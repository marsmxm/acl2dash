<p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HONS-COPY.html">hons-copy</a> x)</span> returns a <a href="ACL2____NORMED.html">normed</a> object that is equal to 
  X.</p><p>In the logic, <span class="v">hons-copy</span> is just the identity function; we 
 leave it enabled and would think it odd to ever prove a theorem about it.</p> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, <span class="v">hons-copy</span> does whatever is necessary to produce a 
 <a href="ACL2____NORMED.html">normed</a> version of X.</p> 
 
 <p>What might this involve?</p> 
 
 <p>If X is a symbol, character, or number, then it is already normed and 
 nothing is done.</p> 
 
 <p>If X is a string, we check if any normed version of X already exists.  If 
 so, we return the already-normed version; otherwise, we install X as the 
 normed version for all strings that are <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> to X.</p> 
 
 <p>If X is a cons, we must determine if there is a normed version of X, or 
 recursively construct and install one.  Norming large cons trees can become 
 expensive, but there are a couple of cheap cases.  In particular, if X is 
 already normed, or if large subtrees of X are already normed, then not much 
 needs to be done.  The slowest case is norming some large ACL2 cons structure 
 that has no subtrees which are already normed.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that running <span class="v">hons-copy</span> on an object that was created with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span> is often slower than just using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a></span> directly when constructing 
 the object.</p>
