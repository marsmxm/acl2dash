<p>Assigning ``often unique'' integers to files and objects</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> for a discussion of how ACL2 can use checksums 
 (though not by default) to increase security in the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> 
 mechanism.</p> 
 
 <p>A <i>checksum</i> is an integer in some fixed range computed from the 
 printed representation of an object, e.g., the sum, modulo <span class="v">2**32</span>, of the 
 ascii codes of all the <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> in the printed representation.</p> 
 
 <p>Ideally, you would like the checksum of an object to be uniquely associated 
 with that object, like a fingerprint.  It could then be used as a convenient 
 way to recognize the object in the future: you could remember the 
 checksum (which is relatively small) and when an object is presented to you 
 and alleged to be the special one you could compute its checksum and see if 
 indeed it was.  Alas, there are many more objects than checksums (after all, 
 each checksum is an object, and then there's <span class="v">t</span>).  So you try to design a 
 checksum algorithm that maps similar looking objects far apart, in the hopes 
 that corruptions and counterfeits — which appear to be similar to the 
 object — have different checksums.  Nevertheless, the best you can do is 
 a many-to-one map.  If an object with a different checksum is presented, you 
 can be positive it is not the special object.  But if an object with the same 
 checksum is presented, you have no grounds for positive identification.</p> 
 
 <p>The basic checksum algorithm in ACL2 is called <span class="v">check-sum-obj</span>, which 
 computes the checksum of an ACL2 object.  Roughly speaking, we scan the print 
 representation of the object and, for each character encountered, we multiply 
 the ascii code of the character times its position in the stream (modulo a 
 certain prime) and then add (modulo a certain prime) that into the running 
 sum.  This is inaccurate in many senses (for example, we don't always use the 
 ascii code and we see numbers as though they were printed in base 127) but 
 indicates the basic idea.</p>
