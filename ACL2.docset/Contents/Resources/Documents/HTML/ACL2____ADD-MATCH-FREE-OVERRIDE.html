<p>Set <span class="v">:match-free</span> value to <span class="v">:once</span> or <span class="v">:all</span> in existing 
  rules</p><pre class="code">Example Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> :once t)
    ; Try only the first binding of free variables when relieving hypotheses
    ; of any rule of class :rewrite, :linear, or :forward-chaining.
(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> :all (:rewrite foo) (:rewrite bar))

 <p>As described elsewhere (see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>), a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, or <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rule may have free variables in its 
 hypotheses, and ACL2 can be directed either to try all bindings 
 (``<span class="v">:all</span>'') or just the first (``<span class="v">:once</span>'') when relieving a 
 hypothesis, as a basis for relieving subsequent hypotheses.  This direction is 
 generally provided by specifying either <span class="v">:match-free :once</span> or 
 <span class="v">:match-free :all</span> in the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> of the rule, or by 
 using the most recent <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-DEFAULT.html">set-match-free-default</a></span> event.  Also see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>However, if a proof is going slowly, you may want to modify the behavior of 
 some such rules so that they use only the first match for free variables in a 
 hypothesis when relieving subsequent hypotheses, rather than backtracking and 
 trying additional matches as necessary.  (But note: 
 <span class="v">add-match-free-override</span> is not relevant for <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> 
 rules.)  The event <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> :once t)</span> has that effect.  Or 
 at the other extreme, perhaps you want to specify all rules as <span class="v">:all</span> rules 
 except for a some specific exceptions.  Then you can execute 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> :all t)</span> followed by, say, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> :once (:rewrite foo) (:linear bar))</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> :clear)
(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> flg t)
(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> flg rune1 rune2 ... runek)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">flg</span> is <span class="v">:once</span> or <span class="v">:all</span> and the <span class="v">runei</span> are <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a></span>s.  If <span class="v">:clear</span> is specified then all rules will have the 
 <span class="v">:all</span>/<span class="v">:once</span> behavior from when they were first stored.  The second 
 general form causes all <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, and <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rules to have the behavior specified by <span class="v">flg</span> (<span class="v">:all</span> 
 or <span class="v">:once</span>).  Finally, the last of these, where runes are specified, is 
 additive in the sense that only the indicated rules are affected; all others 
 keep the behavior they had just before this event was executed (possible 
 because of earlier <span class="v">add-match-free-override</span> events).</p> 
 
 <p>At the conclusion of this event, ACL2 prints out the list of all 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> runes whose rules contain free variables in hypotheses that 
 are to be bound <span class="v">:once</span>, except that if there are no overrides (value 
 <span class="v">:clear</span> was used), then <span class="v">:clear</span> is printed.</p> 
 
 <p>This event only affects rules that exist at the time it is executed. 
 Future rules are not affected by the override.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> 
 but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded.  It 
 uses the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, and hence its effect is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to 
 the book or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form in which it occurs.</p>
