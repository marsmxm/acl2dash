<p>This type captures the basic structure of ABNF trees, 
       without reference to specific rules.</p><p>Since a single <span class="v">num-val</span> or <span class="v">char-val</span> 
       may expand into a sequence of terminal values (i.e. natural numbers), 
       we use lists of natural numbers as leaves of the trees.</p><p>To represent trees whose rule names are not all expanded, 
       rule names may appear as leaves too.</p><p>A non-leaf node of a tree is optionally labeled by a rule name. 
       When it is labeled by a rule name, 
       the branches correspond to 
       a <a href="ABNF____CONCATENATION.html">concatenation</a> chosen from 
       the <a href="ABNF____ALTERNATION.html">alternation</a> associated to the rule name. 
       But since a concatenation is a sequence of <a href="ABNF____REPETITION.html">repetition</a>s, 
       and a repetition may expand to multiple instances 
       of the <a href="ABNF____ELEMENT.html">element</a> of the repetition, 
       the branches are organized as a list of lists: 
       the outer list corresponds to 
       the list of repetitions that form the chosen concatenation, 
       while each inner list corresponds to 
       the element instances of the corresponding repetition. 
       An empty inner list is used for a repetition of no elements. 
       An empty outer list is used for an empty concatenation, 
       which is disallowed by [RFC:4] but allowed by our abstract syntax; 
       an empty outer list is also used 
       for an option [RFC:3.8] that is absent.</p><p>Since, via groups [RFC:3.5] and options [RFC:3.8], 
       an element may recursively be an alternation, 
       if a branch in an inner list under a rule name is an alternation, 
       that branch recursively has a list of lists of branches. 
       In this case, there is no rule name labeling the root of this branch. 
       A rule name provides a name for an alternation; 
       the presence of a rule name in a non-leaf node of a tree 
       indicates that a named alternation is expanded 
       at that place in the tree.</p>
