<p>A formalization of ACL2 packages.</p><p>Packages are defined via <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> in ACL2. 
     Its arguments are 
     the name of the package, 
     a term that evaluates to the import list of the package, 
     and an optional documentation string.</p><p>In our formalization, we ignore the documentation string, 
     and we consider the evaluated import list 
     (as opposed to the term that evaluates to it). 
     Thus, we introduce a notion of package as consisting of 
     a package name and a list of symbol values.</p><p>Here we allow any string as package name, 
     despite the restrictions given in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>. 
     Those restrictions can be captured elsewhere.</p>
