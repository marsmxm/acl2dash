<p>Make a rule that specifies the type of a term</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a general discussion of rule classes, 
 including how they are used to build rules from formulas and a discussion of 
 the various keywords in a rule class description.  In this topic we focus on 
 user-defined type-prescription rules, but note that ACL2 also introduces 
 type-prescription rules when introducing a function with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>; see 
 <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION-DEBUGGING.html">type-prescription-debugging</a> for discussion of how to influence the 
 generation of such rules.</p>

 <p>To specify the term whose type (see <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a>) is described by the 
 rule, provide that term as the value of the <span class="v">:typed-term</span> field of the rule 
 class object.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form (after preprocessing; see below):
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> hyps
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> type-restriction1-on-pat
             ...
             type-restrictionk-on-pat
             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> pat var1)
             ...
             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> pat varj)))</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">pat</span> is the application of some function symbol to some 
 arguments, each <span class="v">type-restrictioni-on-pat</span> is a term involving <span class="v">pat</span> and 
 containing no variables outside of the occurrences of <span class="v">pat</span>, and each 
 <span class="v">vari</span> is one of the variables of <span class="v">pat</span>.  Generally speaking, the 
 <span class="v">type-restriction</span> terms ought to be terms that inform us as to the type of 
 <span class="v">pat</span>.  Ideally, they should be ``primitive recognizing expressions'' about 
 <span class="v">pat</span>; see <a href="ACL2____COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a>.  We describe preprocessing at the 
 end of this topic.</p> 
 
 <p>If the <span class="v">:typed-term</span> is not provided in the rule class object, it is 
 computed heuristically by looking for a term in the conclusion whose type is 
 being restricted.  An error is caused if no such term is found.</p> 
 
 <p>Roughly speaking, the effect of adding such a rule is to inform the ACL2 
 typing mechanism that <span class="v">pat</span> has the type described by the conclusion, when 
 the hypotheses are true.  In particular, the type of <span class="v">pat</span> is within the 
 union of the types described by the several disjuncts.  The ``type described 
 by'' <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> pat vari)</span> is the type of <span class="v">vari</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>More operationally, when asked to determine the type of a term that is an 
 instance of <span class="v">pat</span>, ACL2 will first attempt to establish the hypotheses. 
 <b>This is done by type reasoning alone, not rewriting!</b> However, if some 
 hypothesis is a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>, then forcing may occur, which may 
 ultimately invoke the rewriter; see <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> and see <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a>. 
 So-called free variables in hypotheses are treated specially; see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>.  Provided the hypotheses are established by type reasoning, 
 ACL2 then unions the types described by the <span class="v">type-restrictioni-on-pat</span> 
 terms together with the types of those subexpressions of <span class="v">pat</span> identified 
 by the <span class="v">vari</span>.  The final type computed for a term is the intersection of 
 the types implied by each applicable rule.  Type prescription rules may be 
 disabled.</p> 
 
 <p>You can limit the recursive establishment of hypotheses of rules; see <a href="ACL2____SET-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-backchain-limit</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Because only type reasoning is used to establish the hypotheses of 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rules, some care must be taken with the hypotheses. 
 Suppose, for example, that the non-recursive function <span class="v">my-statep</span> is 
 defined as</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> my-statep (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> x)
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> x) 2)))</pre> 
 
 <p>and suppose <span class="v">(my-statep s)</span> occurs as a hypothesis of a 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rule that is being considered for use in the proof 
 attempt for a conjecture with the hypothesis <span class="v">(my-statep s)</span>.  Since the 
 hypothesis in the conjecture is rewritten, it will become the conjunction of 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> s)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> s) 2)</span>.  Those two terms will be 
 assumed to have type <span class="v">t</span> in the context in which the 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rule is tried.  But type reasoning will be unable to 
 deduce that <span class="v">(my-statep s)</span> has type <span class="v">t</span> in this context.  Thus, either 
 <span class="v">my-statep</span> should be disabled (see <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>) during the proof 
 attempt or else the occurrence of <span class="v">(my-statep s)</span> in the 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rule should be replaced by the conjunction into which 
 it rewrites.</p> 
 
 <p>While this example makes it clear how non-recursive predicates can cause 
 problems, non-recursive functions in general can cause problems.  For example, 
 if <span class="v">(mitigate x)</span> is defined to be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> x) x)</span> then 
 the hypothesis <span class="v">(pred (mitigate s))</span> in the conjecture will rewrite, 
 opening <span class="v">mitigate</span> and splitting the conjecture into two subgoals, one in 
 which <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> s)</span> and <span class="v">(pred (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> x))</span> are assumed and the other in 
 which <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> s))</span> and <span class="v">(pred x)</span> are assumed.  But <span class="v">(pred
 (mitigate s))</span> will not be typed as <span class="v">t</span> in either of these contexts.  The 
 moral is: beware of non-recursive functions occurring in the hypotheses of 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rules.</p> 
 
 <p>Because of the freedom one has in forming the conclusion of a 
 type-prescription, we have to use heuristics to recover the pattern, <span class="v">pat</span>, 
 whose type is being specified.  In some cases our heuristics may not identify 
 the intended term and the <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rule will be rejected as 
 illegal because the conclusion is not of the correct form.  When this happens 
 you may wish to specify the <span class="v">pat</span> directly.  This may be done by using a 
 suitable rule class token.  In particular, when the token 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> is used it means ACL2 is to compute pat with its 
 heuristics; otherwise the token should be of the form <span class="v">(:type-prescription
 :typed-term pat)</span>, where <span class="v">pat</span> is the term whose type is being 
 specified.</p> 
 
 <p>The defun event may generate a <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rule.  Suppose 
 <span class="v">fn</span> is the name of the function concerned.  Then <span class="v">(:type-prescription
 fn)</span> is the rune given to the type-prescription, if any, generated for 
 <span class="v">fn</span> by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.  (The trivial rule, saying <span class="v">fn</span> has unknown type, 
 is not stored, but <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> still allocates the rune and the corollary of 
 this rune is known to be <span class="v">t</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>We close with a discussion of how, before a term is parsed into a 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rule, it is preprocessed.  We describe this 
 preprocessing in some detail below, but first consider the following 
 (contrived) example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> append-tp-example
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((result (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y)))
    (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____NAT-LISTP.html">nat-listp</a> x)
             (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((second-hyp (<a href="ACL2____INTEGER-LISTP.html">integer-listp</a> y)))
                        second-hyp)
                      (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> result))))
  :rule-classes :type-prescription)</pre> 
 
 <p>This theorem is parsed into a type-prescription rule with the following 
 hypotheses and conclusion.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____NAT-LISTP.html">nat-listp</a> x) ; first hypothesis
((<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (second-hyp) second-hyp) (<a href="ACL2____INTEGER-LISTP.html">integer-listp</a> y)) ; second hypothesis
(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a> x y)) ; conclusion</pre> 
 
 <p>Notice that the top-level <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> was expanded, i.e., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y)</span> 
 was substituted for <span class="v">result</span> — more accurately, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a> x
 y)</span> was substituted for <span class="v">result</span>, since <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a></span> is a macro that 
 abbreviates <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></span>.  Also notice that the two hypotheses were 
 ``flattened'' in the sense that they were gathered up into a list.  Finally, 
 notice that the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> in the second hypothesis was not expanded (it was 
 merely translated to internal form, using <span class="v">LAMBDA</span>).  If you actually 
 submit the theorem above, you will get warnings, which you may choose to 
 ignore; the application of <span class="v">type-prescription</span> rules is somewhat subtle, so 
 if you use them then you may wish to experiment to see which forms work best 
 for you.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is the detail promised above, for parsing a term into a 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rule.  There are two steps.  (1) ACL2 first translates 
 the term, expanding all macros (see <a href="ACL2____TRANS.html">trans</a>) and also removing <a href="ACL2____GUARD-HOLDERS.html">guard-holders</a>.  (2) Then the the translated term is traversed top-down, 
 expanding away <span class="v">lambda</span>s (<span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> 
 expressions) and flattening the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> structure, until the 
 conclusion is exposed; then the conclusion's <span class="v">lambda</span>s are also expanded 
 away.  The simplest way to understand (2) may be to look at the definition of 
 ACL2 source function <span class="v">unprettyify-tp</span>, which implements Step (2), say by 
 evaluating <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span><span class="v"> unprettyify-tp</span>.</p>
