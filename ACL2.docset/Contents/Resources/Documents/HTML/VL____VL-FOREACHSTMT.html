            <pre class="code">foreach( &lt;array&gt; [ &lt;var1&gt;, ..., &lt;varN&gt; ] ) statement</pre> 
 
            <p>See SystemVerilog-2012 section 12.7.3.  The <span class="v">&lt;array&gt;</span> should 
            be a (possibly hierarchical) reference to an array variable, which 
            we just represent with an expression.</p> 
 
            <p>The variable list allows us to introduce name variables 
            corresponding to certain dimensions of the array.  It should not 
            mention more variables than the dimensions of the array.  Variable 
            names may also be omitted to indicate that we don't want to iterate 
            through that particular dimension of the array.  We represent these 
            with a <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-EXPRLIST.html">vl-maybe-exprlist</a> so that you can tell when a 
            variable has been omitted.</p> 
 
            <p>We infer a <a href="VL____VL-VARDECL.html">vl-vardecl</a> from each loop variable.  These 
            will be <span class="v">integer</span> variables.  This arguably contradicts the 
            standard, which suggests (12.7.3) that each loop variable is 
            ``implicitly declared to be consistent with the type of array 
            index.''  In other words, the standard seems to suggest that code 
            like:</p> 
 
            <pre class="code">logic [3:0][7:0][15:0] arr;
foreach (arr [i,j,k]) begin
  $display("Size of i is %d", $bits(i));
  $display("Size of j is %d", $bits(j));
  $display("Size of k is %d", $bits(k));
end</pre> 
 
            <p>should report sizes such as 2, 3, and 4.  But commercial tools 
            seem to report a size of 32 bits for all of these variables, so we 
            think that in practice these are interpreted as 
            <span class="v">integer</span>s.</p>
