<p>The read-eval-print loop entered to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> rules</p><p>ACL2 allows the user to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the application of <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a>, and <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> rules.  When <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed 
 rules are about to be tried by the rewriter, an interactive break occurs and 
 the user is allowed to watch and, in a limited sense, control the attempt to 
 apply the rule.  This interactive loop, which is technically just a call of 
 the standard top-level ACL2 read-eval-print loop, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>, on a ``<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>'' (see <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>), is called ``break-rewrite.'' 
 While in break-rewrite, certain keyword commands are available for accessing 
 information about the context in which the lemma is being tried.  These 
 keywords are called break-rewrite ``commands''; see <a href="ACL2____BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For a related utility, see <a href="ACL2____DMR.html">dmr</a> (Dynamically Monitor Rewrites), which 
 allows you to watch progress of the rewriter in real time.</p> 
 
 <p>To abort from inside break-rewrite at any time, execute <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____A_12.html">a!</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Output from break-rewrite is abbreviated by default, but that can be 
 changed.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-BRR-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-brr-evisc-tuple</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For further information, see the related <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> topics listed 
 below.</p> 
 
 <p>It is possible to cause the ACL2 rewriter to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the attempted 
 application of selected rules.  When such a rule is about to be tried, the 
 rewriter evaluates its break condition and if the result is non-<span class="v">nil</span>, 
 break-rewrite is entered.</p> 
 
 <p>Break-rewrite permits the user to inspect the current <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> by 
 evaluating break-rewrite commands.  Type <span class="v">:help</span> in break-rewrite to see 
 what the break-rewrite commands are.  However, break-rewrite is actually just 
 a call of the general ACL2 read-eval-print loop, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>, on a certain 
 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> and the break-rewrite commands are simply aliases provided by 
 <span class="v">ld-keyword-aliases</span> <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> (see <a href="ACL2____LD-KEYWORD-ALIASES.html">ld-keyword-aliases</a>).  See 
 <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> for details about this read-eval-print loop.  Thus, with a few 
 exceptions, anything you can do at the ACL2 top-level can be done within 
 break-rewrite.  For example, you can evaluate arbitrary expressions, use the 
 keyword command hack, access <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>, print <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, and 
 even define functions and prove theorems.  However, the ``certain <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>'' upon which <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> was called is a ``wormhole state'' (see <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>) because break-rewrite is not allowed to have any effect upon the 
 behavior of rewrite.  What this means, at a high level, is that break-rewrite 
 operates on a copy of the <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> being used by rewrite and when 
 break-rewrite exits the <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> closes and the <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> 
 ``produced'' by break-rewrite disappears.  For example, all invocations of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNTRACE_42.html">untrace$</a></span> that are made during a break at a <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> are undone when proceeding from that break.  Thus, 
 break-rewrite lets you query the state of the rewriter and even do experiments 
 involving proofs, etc., but these experiments have no effect on the ongoing 
 proof attempt.</p> 
 
 <p>There are however exceptions to this loss of state when exiting a break. 
 One exception is that the effect of turning on iprinting in a break (see <a href="ACL2____SET-IPRINT.html">set-iprint</a>) will persist even after exiting the break.  The other exceptions 
 pertain to setting the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR-EVISC-TUPLE.html">brr-evisc-tuple</a></span> or invoking <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a></span> or 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a></span>: if these are done inside the break-rewrite loop at level 1 
 of interaction (i.e., at the top level) then their effects will persist even 
 after exiting the break.</p> 
 
 <p>When you first enter break-rewrite a simple herald is printed such as:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(3 Breaking (:rewrite lemma12) on (delta a (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 j)):</pre> 
 
 <p>The integer after the open parenthesis indicates the depth of nested 
 break-rewrite calls.  In this discussion we use <span class="v">3</span> consistently for this 
 integer.  Unless you abort or somehow enter unbalanced parentheses into the 
 script, the entire session at a given depth will be enclosed in balanced 
 parentheses, making it easy to skip over them in Emacs.</p> 
 
 <p>You then will see the break-rewrite <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">3 ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>The leading integer is, again, the depth.  Because breaks often occur 
 recursively it is convenient always to know the level with which you are 
 interacting.</p> 
 
 <p>You may type arbitrary commands as in the top-level ACL2 loop.  For 
 example, you might type:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">3 ACL2 !&gt;:help</pre> 
 
 <p>or</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">3 ACL2 !&gt;:pe lemma12</pre> 
 
 <p>Exceptions are that <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span> and related commands such as 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBU.html">ubu</a></span>, as well as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PUFF_A2.html">puff*</a></span>, are only allowed 
 to touch <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s issued after entering the interactive break. 
 (Technical detail: that is because <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISABLE-UBT.html">disable-ubt</a></span> is invoked when 
 entering the break.)</p> 
 
 <p>More likely than typing a history command, upon entering break-rewrite you 
 will determine the context of the attempted application.  Here are some useful 
 commands:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">3 ACL2 &gt;:target           ; the term being rewritten
3 ACL2 &gt;:unify-subst      ; the unifying substitution
3 ACL2 &gt;:path             ; the stack of goals pursued by the rewriter
                          ; starting at the top-level clause being simplified
                          ; and ending with the current application</pre> 
 
 <p>At this point in the interaction the system has not yet tried to apply the 
 <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rule.  That is, it has not tried to establish the hypotheses, 
 considered the heuristic cost of backchaining, rewritten the right-hand side 
 of the conclusion, etc.  When you are ready for it to try the rule you can 
 type one of several different ``proceed'' commands.  The basic proceed 
 commands are <span class="v">:ok</span>, <span class="v">:go</span>, and <span class="v">:eval</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:ok</pre> 
 
 <p>exits break-rewrite without further interaction.  When break-rewrite exits 
 it prints ``<span class="v">3)</span>'', closing the parenthesis that opened the level <span class="v">3</span> 
 interaction.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:go</pre> 
 
 <p>exits break-rewrite without further interaction, but prints out the result 
 of the application attempt, i.e., whether the application succeeded, if so, 
 what the <span class="v">:target</span> term was rewritten to, and if not why the rule was not 
 applicable.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:eval</pre> 
 
 <p>causes break-rewrite to attempt to apply the rule but interaction at this 
 level of break-rewrite resumes when the attempt is complete.  When control 
 returns to this level of break-rewrite a message indicating the result of the 
 application attempt (just as in <span class="v">:go</span>) is printed, followed by the <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a> for additional user input.</p> 
 
 <p>Generally speaking, <span class="v">:ok</span> and <span class="v">:go</span> are used when the break in 
 question is routine or uninteresting and <span class="v">:eval</span> is used when the break is 
 one that the user anticipates is causing trouble.  For example, if you are 
 trying to determine why a lemma isn't being applied to a given term and the 
 <span class="v">:target</span> of the current break-rewrite is the term in question, you would 
 usually <span class="v">:eval</span> the rule and if break-rewrite reports that the rule failed 
 then you are in a position to determine why, for example by carefully 
 inspecting the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-ALIST.html">type-alist</a></span> of governing assumptions or why some 
 hypothesis of the rule could not be established.</p> 
 
 <p>It is often the case that when you are in break-rewrite you wish to change 
 the set of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s.  This can be done by using 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a></span> as noted above.  For 
 example, you might want to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> a certain rule, say 
 <span class="v">hyp-reliever</span>, just when it is being used while attempting to apply 
 another rule, say <span class="v">main-lemma</span>.  Typically then you would <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> 
 <span class="v">main-lemma</span> at the ACL2 top-level, start the proof-attempt, and then in 
 the break-rewrite in which <span class="v">main-lemma</span> is about to be tried, you would 
 install a <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> on <span class="v">hyp-reliever</span>.  If during the ensuing 
 <span class="v">:eval</span> <span class="v">hyp-reliever</span> is broken you will know it is being used under 
 the attempt to apply <span class="v">main-lemma</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>However, once <span class="v">hyp-reliever</span> is being <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed it will be <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed even after <span class="v">main-lemma</span> has been tried.  That is, if you let the 
 proof attempt proceed then you may see many other breaks on <span class="v">hyp-reliever</span>, 
 breaks that are not ``under'' the attempt to apply <span class="v">main-lemma</span>.  One way 
 to prevent this is to <span class="v">:eval</span> the application of <span class="v">main-lemma</span> and then 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a></span> <span class="v">hyp-reliever</span> before exiting.  But this case 
 arises so often that ACL2 supports several additional ``flavors'' of proceed 
 commands.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Ok!</span>, <span class="v">:go!</span>, and <span class="v">:eval!</span> are just like their counterparts 
 (<span class="v">:ok</span>, <span class="v">:go</span>, and <span class="v">:eval</span>, respectively), except that while 
 processing the rule that is currently broken no <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s are <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed.  When consideration of the current rule is complete, the set of 
 <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s is restored to its original setting.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Ok$</span>, <span class="v">:go$</span>, and <span class="v">:eval$</span> are similar but take an additional 
 argument which must be a list of <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s.  An example usage of 
 <span class="v">:eval$</span> is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">3 ACL2 !&gt;:eval$ ((:rewrite hyp-reliever))</pre> 
 
 <p>These three commands temporarily install unconditional breaks on the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s listed, proceed with the consideration of the currently broken rule, 
 and then restore the set of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules to its original 
 setting.</p> 
 
 <p>Thus, there are nine ways to proceed from the initial entry into 
 break-rewrite although we often speak as though there are two, <span class="v">:ok</span> and 
 <span class="v">:eval</span>, and leave the others implicit.  We group <span class="v">:go</span> with <span class="v">:ok</span> 
 because in all their flavors they exit break-rewrite without further 
 interaction (at the current level).  All the flavors of <span class="v">:eval</span> require 
 further interaction after the rule has been tried.</p> 
 
 <p>To abort a proof attempt and return to the top-level of ACL2 you may at any 
 time type <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____A_12.html">a!</a>)</span> followed by a carriage return.  If you are not in a raw 
 Lisp break, you may type <span class="v">:a!</span> instead.  The utility <span class="v">p!</span> is completely 
 analogous to <span class="v">a!</span> except that it pops up only one <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> level.  If you 
 have just entered the break-rewrite loop, this will pop you out of that loop, 
 back to the proof.  See <a href="ACL2____A_12.html">a!</a> and see <a href="ACL2____P_12.html">p!</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We now address ourselves to the post-<span class="v">:eval</span> interaction with 
 break-rewrite.  As noted, that interaction begins with break-rewrite's report 
 on the results of applying the rule: whether it worked and either what it 
 produced or why it failed.  This information is also printed by certain 
 keyword commands available after <span class="v">:eval</span>, namely <span class="v">:wonp</span>, 
 <span class="v">:rewritten-rhs</span> or (for <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> rules) <span class="v">:poly-list</span>, and 
 <span class="v">:failure-reason</span>.  In addition, by using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a></span> you can obtain this 
 information in the form of ACL2 data objects.  This allows the development of 
 more sophisticated ``break conditions''; see <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> for examples.  In 
 this connection we point out the macro form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____OK-IF.html">ok-if</a> term)</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____OK-IF.html">ok-if</a>.  This command exits break-rewrite if <span class="v">term</span> evaluates to 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> and otherwise does not exit.  Thus it is possible to define 
 macros that provide other kinds of exits from break-rewrite.  The only way to 
 exit break-rewrite after <span class="v">:eval</span> is <span class="v">:ok</span> (or, equivalently, the use of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OK-IF.html">ok-if</a></span>).</p> 
 
 <p>Note that when inside break-rewrite, all <a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a> commands, such as 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span>, show the <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a>d status of rules with respect to the 
 current point in the proof attempt.  For example, if you break while the 
 prover is working on Subgoal 3, and the <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> supplied for the proof 
 specify <span class="v">("Subgoal 3" :in-theory (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> foo))</span> for some rule <span class="v">foo</span>, 
 then <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> will indicate that <span class="v">foo</span> is <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d: even 
 though <span class="v">foo</span> may be enabled globally, it is shown as disabled because it is 
 disabled during Subgoal 3.  See subtopics of <a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a> for a list of all 
 such history commands.  In addition to those commands, the function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISABLEDP.html">disabledp</a></span> is also evaluated inside break-rewrite with respect to the current 
 enabled state of the prover.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 users who wish to know more about break-rewrite so that they can 
 develop more convenient ways to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> rules are encouraged to speak 
 to J Moore.</p> 
 
 <p>The rest of this <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> discusses a few implementation 
 details of break-rewrite and may not be interesting to the typical user.</p> 
 
 <p>There is no ACL2 function named break-rewrite.  It is an illusion created 
 by appropriate calls to two functions named <span class="v">brkpt1</span> and <span class="v">brkpt2</span>.  As 
 previously noted, break-rewrite is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> operating on a <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> 
 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  One might therefore wonder how break-rewrite can apply a rule 
 and then communicate the results back to the rewriter running in the external 
 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  The answer is that it cannot.  Nothing can be communicated 
 through a <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>.  In fact, <span class="v">brkpt1</span> and <span class="v">brkpt2</span> are each 
 calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> running on <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>s.  <span class="v">Brkpt1</span> 
 implements the pre-<span class="v">:eval</span> break-rewrite and <span class="v">brkpt2</span> implements the 
 post-<span class="v">:eval</span> break-rewrite.  The rewriter actually calls <span class="v">brkpt1</span> before 
 attempting to apply a rule and calls <span class="v">brkpt2</span> afterwards.  In both cases, 
 the rewriter passes into the <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> the relevant information about 
 the current context.  Logically <span class="v">brkpt1</span> and <span class="v">brkpt2</span> are no-ops and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> ignores the <span class="v">nil</span> they return.  But while control is in 
 them, the execution of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> is suspended and cannot proceed until 
 the break-rewrite interactions complete.</p> 
 
 <p>This design causes a certain anomaly that might be troubling.  Suppose that 
 inside break-rewrite before <span class="v">:evaling</span> a rule (i.e., in the <span class="v">brkpt1</span> 
 <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>) you define some function, <span class="v">foo</span>.  Suppose 
 then you <span class="v">:eval</span> the rule and eventually control returns to break-rewrite 
 (i.e., to <span class="v">brkpt2</span> on a <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> with the results of 
 the application in it).  You will discover that <span class="v">foo</span> is no longer defined! 
 That is because the <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> created during your 
 <span class="v">pre-:eval</span> interaction is lost when we exit the <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> to resume 
 the proof attempt.  The post-<span class="v">:eval</span> <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> is in 
 fact identical to the initial pre-<span class="v">:eval</span> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> (except for the 
 results of the application) because <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> did not change the 
 external <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> and both <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a> <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>s are copies of it. 
 A similar issue occurs with the use of <a href="COMMON-LISP____TRACE.html">trace</a> utilities: all effects of 
 calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNTRACE_42.html">untrace$</a></span> are erased when you proceed from a 
 break in the break-rewrite loop.</p>
