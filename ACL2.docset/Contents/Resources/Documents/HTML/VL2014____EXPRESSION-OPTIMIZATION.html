<p>Simplify expressions in a few trivial ways, mainly to clean up ugly 
generated expressions.</p><p>During the course of expression rewriting, splitting, and so on, we 
often introduce intermediate expressions which are ugly, large, confusing, 
etc.; We now introduce a routine to perform some really trivial optimizations, 
which actually produce a pretty significant impact when applied throughout the 
rewritten, split up, simplified tree.</p> 
 
<p>WARNING: These are only valid on sized expressions!</p>
