<p>A library about the ACL2 programming language.</p><p>The ACL2 theorem prover includes a programming language, 
     which is essentially a subset of Common Lisp. 
     ACL2 also includes a logical language, 
     which is a superset of a subset of Common Lisp.</p><p>This library formalizes certain aspects of 
     the syntax and semantics of 
     the ACL2 programming language.</p><p>The formalization of the ACL2 evaluation semantics in this library 
     is currently just the work of this library's author. 
     It is not an official descripion of the ACL2 evaluation semantics 
     in an analogous sense that <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/km97a.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>this techical report<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/km97a.pdf"></nobr></a> is an official description of the ACL2 logical semantics. 
     Refer to manual pages like <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">this one</a> for an official description of the ACL2 evaluation semantics.</p>
