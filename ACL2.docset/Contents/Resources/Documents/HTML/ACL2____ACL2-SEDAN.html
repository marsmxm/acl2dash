<p>ACL2 Sedan interface</p><p>Many successful ACL2 users run in an shell under Emacs; see <a href="ACL2____EMACS.html">emacs</a>.  However, those not familiar with Emacs may prefer to start with an 
 Eclipse-based interface initially developed by Peter Dillinger and Pete 
 Manolios called the <a href="http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2 
 Sedan<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/doc/"></nobr></a> or ``ACL2s''.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 sessions in the ACL2 Sedan can utilize non-standard extensions and 
 enhancements, especially geared toward new users, termination reasoning, and 
 attaching rich user interfaces.  These extensions are <a href="http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/src/acl2-extensions" target="_blank"><nobr>generally 
 available<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://acl2s.ccs.neu.edu/acl2s/src/acl2-extensions"></nobr></a> as certifiable ACL2 books. 
 (Some code originating from this project has been migrated to the ACL2 
 community books, but only after it was quite stable.)  Thanks to Peter 
 Dillinger, Pete Manolios, Daron Vroon, and Harsh Raju Chamarthi for their work 
 on the ACL2 Sedan and for making their books available to ACL2 users.</p>
