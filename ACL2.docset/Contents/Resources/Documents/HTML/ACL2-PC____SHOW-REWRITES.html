<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2-PC____SHOW-REWRITES">Click for ACL2-pc::show-rewrites in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>(macro) 
display the applicable <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules</p><pre class="code">Example:
show-rewrites

General Form:
(show-rewrites &amp;optional rule-id enabled-only-flg)</pre> 
 
 <p>This command displays <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules whose left-hand side matches the 
 current subterm, and shows how that command can be applied.  For each rule 
 displayed, hypotheses are shown that would need to be proved after the rule is 
 applied.  Note that hypotheses are omitted from the display when the system 
 can trivially verify that they hold; to see all hypotheses for each rule in a 
 display that is independent of the arguments of the current subterm, use the 
 <span class="v">pl</span> or <span class="v">pr</span> command.</p> 
 
 <p>Here are details on the arguments and the output.  If <span class="v">rule-id</span> is 
 supplied and is a name (non-<span class="v">nil</span> symbol) or a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> or 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>, then only the corresponding rewrite 
 rule(s) will be displayed, while if <span class="v">rule-id</span> is a positive integer <span class="v">n</span>, 
 then only the <span class="v">n</span>th rule that would be in the list is displayed.  In each 
 case, the display will point out when a rule is currently disabled (in the 
 interactive environment), except that if <span class="v">enabled-only-flg</span> is supplied and 
 not <span class="v">nil</span>, then disabled rules will not be displayed at all.  Finally, 
 among the free variables of any rule (see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>), those that 
 would remain free if the rule were applied will be displayed.  Also see <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>.</p>
