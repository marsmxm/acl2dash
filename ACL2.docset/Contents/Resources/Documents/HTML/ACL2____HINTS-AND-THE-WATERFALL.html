<p>How <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> fit into the ACL2 proof waterfall</p><p>Below we describe the flow of an ACL2 proof attempt, with special 
 attention to how <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> are applied during a proof.  For most ACL2 
 users, only one point is important to take away from this <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> 
 topic: you may specify hints during a proof (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>; perhaps also 
 see <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-HINTS.html">default-hints</a>), and they can be 
 expected to behave intuitively.  See <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a> for a summary of how to 
 interact with the ACL2 prover; see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> 
 for a more detailed tutorial; and see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> for an introduction to ACL2 
 hints, including detailed <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for specific hint types.</p> 
 
 <p>The remainder of this topic serves as a reference in case one needs a 
 deeper understanding of the workings of ACL2's handling of hints.  Also, for 
 examples of the sophisticated use of hints, primarily for experts, see 
 community book <span class="v">books/hints/basic-tests.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>First, we describe the ACL2 ``waterfall''.  Then, we describe how hints are 
 handled by the waterfall.</p> 
 
 <p><b>The Waterfall.</b></p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 <i>waterfall</i> is the heart of the ACL2 prover.  It attempts to 
 prove a given goal and either completes the proof, fails, or produces goals to 
 be proved by induction or forcing rounds.  The waterfall comprises a series of 
 <i>steps</i>, such as simplification or generalization, each of which attempts 
 to replace a given goal by zero or more subgoals whose provability implies 
 provability of that goal.  Note that every proof by induction starts a new 
 trip through the waterfall, as does every forcing round; and these occur only 
 after all preceding trips through the waterfall are complete.  Let us see in 
 more detail how the waterfall works.</p> 
 
 <p>Each goal considered by the ACL2 prover passes through a series of proof 
 processes, called the ``waterfall processes'', as stored in the constant 
 <span class="v">*preprocess-clause-ledge*</span>.  The top process applies top-level hints, 
 including <span class="v">:use</span> hints; the next is a lightweight ``preprocess'' simplifier 
 for ``simple'' rules (see <a href="ACL2____SIMPLE.html">simple</a>); the next is the main ACL2 
 simplifier; and finally ACL2 attempts (in this order) destructor elimination, 
 fertilization (heuristic use of equalities), generalization, and elimination 
 of irrelevance.  See <a href="ACL2____ARCHITECTURE-OF-THE-PROVER.html">architecture-of-the-prover</a> for more information on 
 these processes.  Each process may ``hit'', creating zero or more child goals 
 that are each then handled at the top of the waterfall; or it may ``miss'', in 
 which case the next process in the above sequence is considered.  If all 
 processes miss, then a ``push'' process defers the goal until it is later 
 considered for proof by induction.  When all goals have been thus handled, the 
 goal most recently pushed for proof by induction is considered, and the 
 process repeats.</p> 
 
 <p>We next describe the two additional ways in which control can be returned 
 to the top of the waterfall.</p> 
 
 <p>When the simplification process is attempted unsuccessfully for a goal, the 
 goal is deemed to have ``settled down''.  This notion of ``settled down'' is 
 handled, as follows, by the next waterfall process after simplification: the 
 ``settled-down'' process.  If some ancestor of the goal (possibly the goal 
 itself) has previously settled down, then the ``settled-down'' process is 
 deemed to have missed on the goal.  Otherwise it hits on the goal, the effect 
 being that the goal makes a new pass through all the waterfall 
 processes.  (Other processes can then notice that settling down has occurred 
 and modify their heuristics accordingly.)  For example, suppose that 
 <span class="v">"Goal"</span> simplifies to <span class="v">"Subgoal 2"</span> (among others), and 
 <span class="v">"Subgoal 2"</span> simplifies to <span class="v">"Subgoal 2.3"</span> (among others), which in 
 turn is not further simplified.  Then the ``settled-down'' process hits on 
 <span class="v">"Subgoal 2.3"</span>, but it does not hit not on any of its children or their 
 children (and so on), because each of those has an ancestor, <span class="v">"Subgoal
 2.3"</span>, that has already been marked as ``settled-down''.</p> 
 
 <p>The next proof process after settled-down is normally destructor 
 elimination.  However, if a computed hint is suitable (in a sense described 
 below; also see <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>, especially the discussion of 
 <span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span>), then that hint is selected as control is 
 returned to the top of the waterfall.  A subtlety is that in this case, if the 
 most recent hit had been from settling down, then the prover ``changes its 
 mind'' and considers that the goal has not yet settled down after all as it 
 continues through the waterfall.</p> 
 
 <p>Each time a goal is considered at the top of the waterfall, then before 
 passing through the proof processes as described above, ACL2 searches for a 
 relevant hint to select unless it has already been provided a hint in the 
 ``<span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span>'' case mentioned above.  We turn now to a 
 more thorough discussion of how hints are selected and applied.</p> 
 
 <p><b>The handling of hints.</b></p> 
 
 <p>In the discussion below we will ignore forcing rounds, as each forcing 
 round is simply treated as a new proof attempt that uses the list of hints 
 provided at the start of the proof.</p> 
 
 <p>When the theorem prover is called by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span> or <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> such as 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span>, it gathers up the 
 hints that have been supplied, often provided as a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a></span> 
 argument, but for example using a <span class="v">:guard-hints</span> argument for <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> 
 verification proofs.  (ACL2(r) users (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>) may also employ 
 <span class="v">:std-hints</span>.)  It then appends these to the front of the list of default 
 hints (see <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-HINTS.html">default-hints</a>).  The resulting list becomes the initial 
 value of the list of ``pending hints'', one of two critical lists maintained 
 by the theorem prover to manage hints.  The other critical list is a list of 
 ``hint settings''; the two lists are maintained as follows.</p> 
 
 <p>When a goal is first considered, a hint is selected from the list of 
 pending hints if any is found to apply, as described below.  If a hint is 
 selected, then it takes effect and is removed from the pending hints.  Except: 
 if the selected hint is a computed hint with value <span class="v">t</span> specified for 
 <span class="v">:computed-hint-replacement</span>, then it is not removed; and if that value is 
 a list of hints, then that list is appended to the front of the list of 
 pending hints after the selected hint is removed (also see <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>).  The selected hint is also used to update the hint settings, 
 as described below.</p> 
 
 <p>The list of hint settings associates hint keywords with values.  It is 
 passed from the current goal to its children (and hence the children's 
 children, and so on), though modified by hints selected from pending hints, as 
 described below.  This list is maintained so that when a goal is pushed for 
 proof by induction, the hint settings are applied at the start of the proof by 
 induction.  Note that the list of hint settings is not re-applied to 
 descendants of a goal in the current waterfall; a hint is applied only when it 
 is selected (and also perhaps later as just described, through the stored hint 
 settings at the start of a proof by induction).  For example, if the hint 
 selected for <span class="v">"Subgoal 3"</span> includes <span class="v">:in-theory (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> foo)</span>, then 
 the hint settings are correspondingly updated when processing <span class="v">"Subgoal
 3"</span>, and they persist at subgoals such as <span class="v">"Subgoal 3.2"</span> and 
 <span class="v">"Subgoal 3.2.1"</span> (unless overridden by hints on those goals); but the 
 theory specifying <span class="v">foo</span> is not re-installed at every such subgoal.</p> 
 
 <p>When a hint is selected, the list of hint settings is updated so that for 
 each keyword <span class="v">:kwd</span> and associated value <span class="v">val</span> from the hint, <span class="v">:kwd</span> 
 is associated with <span class="v">val</span> in the hint settings, discarding any previous 
 association of <span class="v">:kwd</span> with a value in the hint settings.  Except, certain 
 ``top-level'' hints are never saved in the hint settings: <span class="v">:use</span>, 
 <span class="v">:cases</span>, <span class="v">:by</span>, <span class="v">:bdd</span>, <span class="v">:or</span>, and <span class="v">:clause-processor</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>For example, suppose that we specify the following hints, with no default 
 hints.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(("Goal" :expand ((bar x y)))
 ("Subgoal 3" :in-theory (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> foo)))</pre> 
 
 <p>These hints then become the initial list of pending hints.  When the proof 
 attempt begins, the prover encounters the top-level goal (<span class="v">"Goal"</span>) and 
 pulls the <span class="v">"Goal"</span> hint from the pending hints, so that the list of hint 
 settings contains a value only for keyword <span class="v">:expand</span>.  This hint setting 
 will remain for all children of the top-level goal as well, and their 
 children, and so on, and will be inherited by induction  in other 
 words, it will remain throughout the entire proof.  Now consider what happens 
 when the proof reaches <span class="v">"Subgoal 3"</span>.  At this point there is only one 
 pending hint, which is in fact attached to that subgoal.  Therefore, this hint 
 is pulled from the pending hints (leaving that list empty), and the hint 
 settings are extended by associating the <span class="v">:in-theory</span> keyword with the 
 theory represented by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> foo)</span>.  That theory is immediately installed 
 until the prover finishes addressing <span class="v">"Subgoal 3"</span>, its children, their 
 children, and so on; and until that completion is reached, the <span class="v">:in-theory</span> 
 keyword remains associated with the <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> foo)</span> in the hint settings, 
 although of course there is no re-installation of the theory at any ensuing 
 child goal.  When finally <span class="v">"Subgoal 3"</span> and its descendants have been 
 completed and the prover is about to consider <span class="v">"Subgoal 2"</span>, the 
 <span class="v">:in-theory</span> association is removed from the hint settings and the global 
 theory is re-installed.  However, the list of pending hints remains empty.</p> 
 
 <p>It remains to describe how a hint is selected for a goal.  When a goal is 
 first considered (hence at the top of the waterfall), the list of pending 
 hints is scanned, in order, until one of the hints is suitable for the goal. 
 An explicit hint <span class="v">(goal-name :kwd1 val1 ... :kwdn valn)</span> is suitable if 
 <span class="v">goal-name</span> is the name of the current goal and there is at least one 
 keyword.  A computed hint is suitable if it evaluates to a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value. 
 As indicated earlier in this documentation topic, an exception occurs when a 
 computed hint is selected after simplification fails (the 
 ``<span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span>'' case): in that case, the goal returns to 
 the top of the waterfall with that hint as the selected hint, and no 
 additional search for a hint to select is made at that time.</p> 
 
 <p>The following slightly tricky example illustrates handling of hints.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a> '(("Goal" :do-not '(preprocess))))
 (("Goal" :DO-NOT '(PREPROCESS)))
ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y) z) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y z))
            :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> car-cons))))

ACL2 Warning [Hints] in ( THM ...):  The goal-spec "Goal" is explicitly
associated with more than one hint.  All but the first of these hints
may be ignored.  If you intended to give all of these hints, combine
them into a single hint of the form ("Goal" :kwd1 val1 :kwd2 val2 ...).

Name the formula above *1.</pre> 
 
 <p>The warning above is printed because <span class="v">"Goal"</span> is associated with two 
 pending hints: one given by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a></span> call and one 
 supplied by the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a></span> keyword of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span> form.  The 
 <span class="v">:in-theory</span> hint is selected because user-supplied hints are ahead of 
 default hints in the list of pending hints; we then get the first ``Note'' 
 above.  The goal progresses through the waterfall without any proof process 
 applying to the goal; in particular, it cannot be further simplified.  After 
 the simplification process, a ``settled-down'' process applies, as discussed 
 above, immediately causing another trip through the waterfall.  Since the 
 <span class="v">:in-theory</span> hint was earlier removed from the list of pending hints when 
 it was applied, the default (<span class="v">:do-not</span>) hint is now the only pending hint. 
 That hint is applied, resulting in the second ``Note'' above.</p> 
 
 <p>Again, more examples may be found in the community book 
 <span class="v">books/hints/basic-tests.lisp</span>.  A particularly tricky but informative 
 example in that book is the one related to <span class="v">nonlinearp-default-hint</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____OVERRIDE-HINTS.html">override-hints</a> for an advanced feature that allows 
 modification of the hint selected for a goal.</p>
