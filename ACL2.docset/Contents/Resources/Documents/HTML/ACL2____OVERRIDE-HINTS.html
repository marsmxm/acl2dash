<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____OVERRIDE-HINTS">Click for Override-hints in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A list of hints given priority in every proof attempt</p><p>This is an advanced feature, originally implemented to help system 
 designers to create ``modes'' that control the way hints are supplied to the 
 theorem prover.  Please see <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-HINTS.html">default-hints</a> for the much more usual way 
 to install hints that may be applied by default.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Examples:
ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____OVERRIDE-HINTS.html">override-hints</a> (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))
((computed-hint-1 clause keyword-alist processor)
 (computed-hint-2 clause keyword-alist stable-under-simplificationp))</pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Override-hints</span> returns a list of computed hints (see <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>) which, unlike other computed hints, may mention the variable 
 <span class="v">KEYWORD-ALIST</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Before reading further, please see <a href="ACL2____HINTS-AND-THE-WATERFALL.html">hints-and-the-waterfall</a> to review 
 the basics of how <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> are applied during a proof.  In particular, we 
 assume familiarity with the notion of selecting a hint to be applied to the 
 current goal.  If there are override-hints, that hint selection is tentative, 
 because if it reduced to <span class="v">nil</span> after the application of override-hints, 
 then that hint will be skipped and the attempt will continue for selecting an 
 applicable hint.  (Craft your override-hints so that <span class="v">:no-op t</span> is returned 
 in such cases instead of <span class="v">nil</span>, if you don't want the hint to be skipped.) 
 But we must explain what is meant by ``the application of override-hints'', 
 and we do that now.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose that there are override-hints when a hint is selected for the 
 current goal.  That selected hint is a keyword-alist, which is an alternating 
 list of hint keywords and their values, whose source is either an explicit 
 hint <span class="v">(goal-name :key1 val1 ... :keyn valn)</span> where the <span class="v">:keyi</span> are 
 allowed to be custom hint keywords (which are expanded away; see <a href="ACL2____CUSTOM-KEYWORD-HINTS.html">custom-keyword-hints</a>), or else is the non-<span class="v">nil</span> keyword-alist produced by 
 evaluating a computed hint.  Then the override-hints are applied to that 
 keyword-alist as follows, one at a time, in order of their occurrence in the 
 list of override-hints (as determined by the use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-OVERRIDE-HINTS.html">set-override-hints</a></span> 
 and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-OVERRIDE-HINTS.html">add-override-hints</a></span>).  The first override-hint is evaluated, in the 
 usual manner of evaluating computed hints but with the variable 
 <span class="v">KEYWORD-ALIST</span> bound to the above keyword-alist.  That evaluation produces 
 a result that should also be a keyword-alist, or else an error occurs.  Any 
 custom keyword hints are then eliminated from that keyword-alist.  The 
 resulting keyword-alist must not contain the <span class="v">:ERROR</span> hint keyword and must 
 not start with the <span class="v">:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</span> keyword; otherwise an error 
 occurs.  With <span class="v">KEYWORD-ALIST</span> bound to this result, the second 
 override-hint is similarly evaluated.  This process continues, and the 
 keyword-alist returned by the final override-hint is the one used when 
 processing the goal at hand.  Except: If that keyword-alist is <span class="v">nil</span>, then 
 the next hint among the pending hints is tentatively selected and the process 
 repeats, applying each override hint to that new tentative selection.  Of 
 course we might obtain <span class="v">nil</span> again, in which case we tentatively select the 
 next pending hint; and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>If finally no hint is selected for the current goal, then 
 <span class="v">KEYWORD-ALIST</span> is bound to <span class="v">nil</span> and the override-hints are applied as 
 described above.  But note that this final step is skipped if hint selection 
 is being performed because <span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span> has just become 
 true, rather than at the top of the waterfall.  (Otherwise the override-hints 
 could easily keep firing uselessly yet putting us back at the top of the 
 waterfall, with no change to the given goal, resulting in an infinite 
 loop.)</p> 
 
 <p>As mentioned above, the <span class="v">:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT</span> keyword is illegal 
 for the value of an override-hint.  But a selected hint may be a computed hint 
 that evaluates to a keyword-alist beginning with prefix 
 <span class="v">:COMPUTED-HINT-REPLACEMENT val</span>.  What value does ACL2 return for such a 
 computed hint in the presence of override-hints?  First, this prefix is 
 stripped off before passing the resulting keyword-alist to the override-hints 
 as described above.  If the result of applying override-hints to that 
 keyword-alist is not <span class="v">nil</span>, then the prefix is put back on the front of 
 that resulting keyword-alist after doing internal processing of the hint, 
 including expansion of any custom keyword hints.  Otherwise, the application 
 of override-hints to the computed hint is <span class="v">nil</span>, so this hint is not 
 selected after all.</p> 
 
 <p><b>WARNING</b>: Unlike ordinary computed hints, a value of <span class="v">nil</span> for an 
 override-hint is not ignored.  That is: When an ordinary computed hint 
 evaluates to <span class="v">nil</span>, it is deemed not to apply, and the next available hint 
 is consulted.  But when an override-hint is evaluated, the result is always 
 supplied for the next binding of the variable <span class="v">KEYWORD-ALIST</span>, even if that 
 result is <span class="v">nil</span>.  If you want an override-hint to be a no-op, return as the 
 expression the variable <span class="v">KEYWORD-ALIST</span> rather than an expression that 
 evaluates to <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>This feature can be used in order to implement a form of additive hints. 
 Suppose for example that you want a hint that turns off generalization.  A 
 simple but inadequate solution is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ADD-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">add-default-hints</a> '((<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a> (:do-not '(<a href="ACL2____GENERALIZE.html">generalize</a>)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The problem is that if there is any explicit hint supplied for a given 
 goal, then it will be the one selected, and the above will be ignored.  But 
 suppose that the explicit hint supplied is of the form <span class="v">("Subgoal x.y"
 :do-not '(fertilize))</span>.  What we would really want in this case is to 
 generate the hint for the indicated subgoal that binds <span class="v">:do-not</span> to a list 
 indicating that both fertilization _and_ generalization are disabled for that 
 goal.  A solution is to merge, for example as follows.  (The use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span> is of course optional, included here to provide debug 
 printing.)</p>
