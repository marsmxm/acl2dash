<p>The condition in which function definitions are elsewhere.</p><p>The <span class="v">FunctionHoister</span> transformation, described in 
     [Solidity: Internals: The Optimizer: Yul-Based Optimizer Module: 
      Preprocessing: FunctionHoister], 
     moves all the function definitions to the top-level block. 
     The <span class="v">FunctionGrouper</span> transformation, described in 
     [Solidity: Internals: The Optimizer: Yul-Based Optimizer Module: 
      Preprocessing: FunctionGrouper], 
     further moves them to the end of the top-level block, 
     putting the rest of the top-level block into a nested block 
     at the beginning of the top-level block. 
     An important property that these transformations establish 
     is that, aside from the top-level block, 
     there are no function definitions in statements and blocks.</p><p>Here we capture this property, 
     which is used as precondition for certain transformations.</p>
