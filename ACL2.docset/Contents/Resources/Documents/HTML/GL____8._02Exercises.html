<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=GL____8._02Exercises">Click for 8. Exercises in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p></p><p>Here are some exercises you can use to get some experience with 
using GL.</p> 
 
<p>These exercises will get you into some rough spots, so that you can learn 
how to get out.  If you get stuck, you can see our solutions in the file 
<span class="v">centaur/gl/solutions.lsp</span>.</p> 
 
<p>We recommend trying to carry out these exercises in a new file.  You will 
probably want to start your file with:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/gl/gl" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>At certain points in the exercises, we assume your computer has at least 
<b>8 GB</b> of memory.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Arithmetic Exercises</h3> 
 
<p><b>1a.</b> Use GL to prove that addition commutes for 4-bit unsigned 
numbers:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 4 x)
              (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 4 y))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> y x)))</pre> 
 
<p><b>1b.</b> Carry out the same proof as in 1a, but construct your 
G-bindings:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>Using <a href="GL____AUTO-BINDINGS.html">auto-bindings</a>
</li> 
 <li>Using <a href="GL____G-INT.html">g-int</a>
</li> 
 <li>"Manually", without using either of these.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Hints: you may want to consult <a href="GL____6._02Writing_02__g-bindings_02forms.html">6. Writing :g-bindings forms</a> and 
<a href="GL____SHAPE-SPECS.html">shape-specs</a>.</p> 
 
 
<p><b>1c.</b> Extend your proof from 1a to 20-bit numbers.  How long does the 
proof take?  How much memory did it use?  Try the <a href="ACL2____HONS-SUMMARY.html">hons-summary</a> command 
get a sense of the memory usage.</p> 
 
 
<p><b>1d.</b> In the same ACL2 session, undo your proof of 1c and submit it 
again.  How long did it take this time?  Can you explain what happened?</p> 
 
 
<p><b>1e.</b> Figure out how to optimize your G-bindings to make the proof in 
1c go through quickly.  For reliable timings, use <a href="ACL2____CLEAR-MEMOIZE-TABLES.html">clear-memoize-tables</a> 
and <a href="ACL2____HONS-CLEAR.html">hons-clear</a> before each proof attempt.  Implement your solution using 
both <a href="GL____G-INT.html">g-int</a> and <a href="GL____AUTO-BINDINGS.html">auto-bindings</a>.</p> 
 
 
<p><b>1f.</b> Use GL to prove that addition commutes up to 3,000 bits. 
Hint: the <a href="GL____DEBUGGING.html">debugging</a> section might be able to help you.</p>
