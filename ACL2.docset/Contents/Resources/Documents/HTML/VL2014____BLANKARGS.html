<p>A transformation which "fills in" blank arguments.</p><p>Verilog permits the use of "blank" expressions as arguments to 
module and gate instances.  See <a href="VL2014____VL-PORT-P.html">vl-port-p</a> and <a href="VL2014____VL-PLAINARG-P.html">vl-plainarg-p</a> for 
some additional discussion.</p> 
 
<p>This transformation "fills in" any blank arguments that are connected to 
non-blank ports with new, fresh wires.  A related (but separate) transformation 
is <a href="VL2014____DROP-BLANKPORTS.html">drop-blankports</a> which eliminates any blank ports and their 
corresponding arguments.</p> 
 
<p>If a blank argument is given to a submodule's non-blank input port, it is 
the equivalent of passing in a Z value.  If a blank argument is given to a 
submodule's non-blank output port, the value being emitted on that port is 
simply inaccessible in the superior module.</p> 
 
<p>In either case, we simply replace the blank argument with a new, fresh, 
otherwise undriven wire of the appropriate size.  This approach works equally 
well for inputs and outputs.  We give these wires names such as 
<span class="v">blank_27</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Unlike <a href="VL2014____DROP-BLANKPORTS.html">drop-blankports</a> which can be applied at any time after <a href="VL2014____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a>, the blankargs transformation requires that expression sizes have 
been computed (see <a href="VL2014____EXPRESSION-SIZING.html">expression-sizing</a>) since the new wires need to have 
the appropriate size.  We also expect that the <a href="VL2014____REPLICATE-INSTS.html">replicate-insts</a> transform 
has been run to ensure that no instances have ranges.</p>
