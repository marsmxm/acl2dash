<p>Execution character set.</p><p>The execution character set is analogous to the source character set 
     except that it has a few additional basic characters [C:5.2.1].</p><p>We formalize the execution characters 
     analogously to the source characters, 
     i.e. as a constrained predicate 
     with an injection from the ASCII basic ones 
     and an injection to numbers. 
     These numbers are not the values of the execution characters, 
     which will be formalized elsewhere; 
     the significance of these number is limited to our ACL2 formalization. 
     See <a href="C____SOURCE-CHARACTER-SET.html">source-character-set</a> for details.</p>
