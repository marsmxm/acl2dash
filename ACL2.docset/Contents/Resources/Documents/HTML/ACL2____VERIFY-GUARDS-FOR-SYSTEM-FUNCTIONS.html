<p>Arranging that source functions come up as guard-verified</p><p>ACL2 is maintained solely by Matt Kaufmann and J Moore.  However, 
 we anticipate that a few others will eventually contribute as well.  Here we 
 discuss how to put built-in functions into <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.  Since 
 ACL2 insists that its built-in <span class="v">:logic</span> mode functions are <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified, we actually explain how to arrange that built-in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions become built-in guard-verified <span class="v">:logic</span> mode 
 functions.</p> 
 
 <p>To put a system function into guard-verified <span class="v">:logic</span> mode, you might 
 first need or want to modify your local copy of the ACL2 sources, for example 
 replacing <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NULL.html">null</a> lst)</span> by <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)</span> in a function's definition in 
 support of the termination proof and then specifying <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> lst)</span> in 
 its guard.  You don't need to become a system developer to do this, but see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE.html">developers-guide</a> if you are an experienced ACL2 user and system 
 development interests you.  IMPORTANT: Eventually you will probably want to 
 undo your changes; this will be explained further below.</p> 
 
 <p>After making such changes, build an ACL2 executable image containing your 
 modified code.  The next step is typically to create a new file, perhaps named 
 after the main function(s) whose guards you want to verify, in directory 
 <span class="v">books/system</span>.  Community book <span class="v">books/system/too-many-ifs.lisp</span> is a 
 good example.  Ultimately, this file should be a certifiable book that 
 verifies the desired termination and guards.  Include this book in 
 <span class="v">books/system/top.lisp</span>.  Of course, you can instead add to some existing 
 file in the same directory that is already included in 
 <span class="v">books/system/top.lisp</span>, rather than creating a new book and including it 
 there.</p> 
 
 <p>Now it is time to add entries to the value of constant 
 <span class="v">*system-verify-guards-alist*</span> in your local copy of the ACL2 sources, 
 which specifies functions whose guard-verification is completed by including 
 <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a> <span class="v">books/system/devel-check.lisp</span> (which includes 
 <span class="v">books/system/top.lisp</span>.  Each entry is of the form <span class="v">(function-symbol
 . measure)</span>.  For example, the entry <span class="v">(ARITY-ALISTP ACL2-COUNT ALIST)</span> 
 signifies that the function symbol <span class="v">arity-alistp</span> is to have measure 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> alist)</span>, while the entry <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ARGLISTP.html">ARGLISTP</a>)</span> signifies that 
 function symbol <span class="v">arglistp</span> has no measure (i.e., we use <span class="v">nil</span> for the 
 measure), presumably because its definition is not recursive.  After you make 
 those additions, then follow the steps below.</p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li>Build a so-called ``devel'' copy in which the functions in 
 <span class="v">*system-verify-guards-alist*</span> remain in <span class="v">:program</span> mode.  For example, 
 the following command will create ``devel'' executable <span class="v">saved_acl2d</span>. 
 
 <pre class="code">(time nice make ACL2_DEVEL=d) &gt;&amp; make-devel.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Check that the build seems to have worked, for example by finding the 
 string <span class="v">"Successfully built"</span> near the end of your log file.</li> 
 
 <li>Run a ``devel'' regression, for example as follows if starting in the ACL2 
 sources directory.  Note that including ``<span class="v">ACL2_USELESS_RUNES= </span>'' as shown 
 below may be necessary because of how proofs differ between normal and 
 ``devel'' versions of ACL2. 
 
 <pre class="code">make clean-books ACL2=`pwd`/saved_acl2d
cd books
(time nice make -j 8 \
           ACL2=`pwd`/../saved_acl2d \
           ACL2_USELESS_RUNES= \
           system/devel-check.cert) \
  &gt;&amp; make-devel-regression.log&amp;</pre> 
 
 The last of these commands should run much more quickly than a normal 
 regression.  You can of course check on it as follows. 
 
 <pre class="code">tail make-devel-regression.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Check that there are no errors, by checking that the following produces no 
 output. 
 
 <pre class="code">fgrep -a '**' make-devel-regression.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Run the following check from your ACL2 sources directory. 
 
 <pre class="code">make devel-check ACL2=`pwd`/saved_acl2d</pre> 
 
 You should see output like the following. 
 
 <pre class="code">SUCCESS for chk-new-verified-guards
SUCCESS for check-system-events
SUCCESS for devel-check</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Now clean the books (see <span class="v">make clean-books</span> above) and then do a normal 
 build and regression.</li> 
 
 <li>Finally, send your changes to Matt Kaufmann, with a request that they be 
 incorporated into the ACL2 sources and books.</li> 
 
 </ol> 
 
 <p>We now return to the remark labeled ``IMPORTANT'' above: undoing your 
 changes.  This isn't necessary if you will not be using that local copy of 
 ACL2 in the future.  But otherwise you may run into problems when you try to 
 use git to merge changes into that local ACL2+books copy.  One option is to 
 throw your changes away by standing in your local ACL2 directory and using the 
 shell command: <span class="v">git checkout -f</span>.  But be careful â€” this will throw 
 away all your work!  So you might want to wait until your changes make it into 
 the main (master) git branch.</p>
