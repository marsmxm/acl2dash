<p>Arranging that source functions come up as guard-verified</p><p>ACL2 is maintained solely by Matt Kaufmann and J Moore.  However, 
 we anticipate that a few others will eventually contribute as well.  Here we 
 discuss how to put built-in functions into <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.  Since 
 ACL2 insists that its built-in <span class="v">:logic</span> mode functions are <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified, we actually explain how to arrange that built-in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions become built in guard-verified <span class="v">:logic</span> mode 
 functions.</p> 
 
 <p>To put a system function into <span class="v">:logic</span> mode, you might first need or 
 want to modify ACL2, for example replacing <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NULL.html">null</a> lst)</span> by <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)</span> 
 in a function's definition in support of the termination proof.  You don't 
 need to become a system developer to do this, but see <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE.html">developers-guide</a> 
 if you are an experienced ACL2 user and system development interests you.</p> 
 
 <p>After making such changes, build an ACL2 executable image containing your 
 modified code.  The next step is typically to create a new file, perhaps named 
 after the main function(s) whose guards you want to verify, in directory 
 <span class="v">books/system</span>.  Community book <span class="v">books/system/too-many-ifs.lisp</span> is a 
 good example.  Ultimately, this file should be a certifiable book that 
 verifies the desired termination and guards.  Include this book in 
 <span class="v">books/system/top.lisp</span>.  Of course, you can instead add to some existing 
 file in the same directory that is already included in 
 <span class="v">books/system/top.lisp</span>, rather than creating a new book and including it 
 there.</p> 
 
 <p>The steps above can be done without touching the ACL2 source files.</p> 
 
 <p>Now it is time to modify the constant <span class="v">*system-verify-guards-alist*</span>, 
 which specifies functions whose guard-verification is proved by including that 
 book.  Follow the steps below.</p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li>Build a so-called ``devel'' copy in which the functions in 
 <span class="v">*system-verify-guards-alist*</span> remain in <span class="v">:program</span> mode.  For example, 
 the following command will create ``devel'' executable <span class="v">saved_acl2d</span>. 
 
 <pre class="code">(time nice make ACL2_DEVEL=d) &gt;&amp; make-devel.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Check that the build seems to have worked, for example by finding the 
 string <span class="v">"Successfully built"</span> near the end of your log file.</li> 
 
 <li>Run a ``devel'' regression, for example as follows if starting in the ACL2 
 sources directory.  Note that including ``<span class="v">ACL2_USELESS_RUNES= </span>'' as shown 
 below may be necessary because of how proofs differ between normal and 
 ``devel'' versions of ACL2. 
 
 <pre class="code">make clean-books ACL2=`pwd`/saved_acl2d
cd books
(time nice make -j 8 \
           ACL2=`pwd`/../saved_acl2d \
           ACL2_USELESS_RUNES= \
           system/devel-check.cert) \
  &gt;&amp; make-devel-regression.log&amp;</pre> 
 
 The last of these commands should run much more quickly than a normal 
 regression.  You can of course check on it as follows. 
 
 <pre class="code">tail make-devel-regression.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Check that there are no errors, by checking that the following produces no 
 output. 
 
 <pre class="code">fgrep -a '**' make-devel-regression.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Run the following check from your ACL2 sources directory. 
 
 <pre class="code">make devel-check ACL2=`pwd`/saved_acl2d</pre> 
 
 You should see output like the following. 
 
 <pre class="code">SUCCESS for chk-new-verified-guards
SUCCESS for check-system-events
SUCCESS for devel-check</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Ideally, you will finally do a normal build and regression.</li> 
 
 </ol>
