<p>Check for unused, unset, spurious wires, and multiply driven wires.</p><p>Lucid is a <a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a> check that scans your design for:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Spurious wiresnever used or set anywhere,</li> 
<li>Unset variablesused without being driven (scary),</li> 
<li>Unused variablesdriven but never used, and</li> 
<li>Multiply driven wireswhich are often not desired.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>These warnings are often about entire wires, but Lucid also carries out a 
bit-level analysis and can often detect when only a portion of a wire is 
unused, unset, or multiply driven.</p> 
 
<p>Typically Lucid is invoked as part of <a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a>; its warnings are found 
in the file <span class="v">vl-lucid.txt</span>.</p> 
 
<p>We have found Lucid to be most useful when refactoring designs and moving 
functionality from one module to another.  In these situations, it is often 
very easy to accidentally leave some wires (or logic) behind, so seeing what is 
undriven or unset can be really handy.</p>
