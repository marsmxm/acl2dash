<p>Binding of lexically scoped (local) variables</p><p>Examples</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((x (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x))
       (y (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 2 x)))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x y))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((x (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x))
       (y (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 2 x))
       (x (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x y))
       (a (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x)))

 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x y))</pre> 
 
 <p>If the forms above are executed in an environment in which <span class="v">x</span> has the 
 value <span class="v">-2</span>, then the respective results are <span class="v">'(4 8)</span> and <span class="v">'(32 8)</span>. 
 See <a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> for a discussion of both <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> and <span class="v">let*</span>, or read on 
 for a briefer discussion.</p> 
 
 <p>The difference between <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> and <span class="v">let*</span> is that the former binds 
 its local variables in parallel while the latter binds them sequentially. 
 Thus, in <span class="v">let*</span>, the term evaluated to produce the local value of one of 
 the locally bound variables is permitted to reference any locally bound 
 variable occurring earlier in the binding list and the value so obtained is 
 the newly computed local value of that variable.  See <a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>In ACL2 the only <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> forms allowed for a <span class="v">let*</span> form are 
 <span class="v">ignore</span>, <span class="v">ignorable</span>, and <span class="v">type</span>.  See <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>.  Moreover, no 
 variable declared <span class="v">ignore</span>d or <span class="v">ignorable</span> may be bound more than once. 
 A variable with a type declaration may be bound more than once, in which case 
 the type declaration is treated by ACL2 as applying to each binding occurrence 
 of that variable.  It seems unclear from the Common Lisp spec whether the 
 underlying Lisp implementation is expected to apply such a declaration to more 
 than one binding occurrence, however, so performance in such cases may depend 
 on the underlying Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Let*</span> is a Common Lisp macro.  See any Common Lisp documentation for 
 more information.</p>
