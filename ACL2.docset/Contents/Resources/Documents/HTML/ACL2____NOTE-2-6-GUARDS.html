<p>ACL2 Version  2.6 Notes on Guard-related Changes</p><p>When you <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> that a function treats certain formals as 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span><span class="v">s</span>, the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of the function is automatically 
 extended to include the corresponding stobj-recognizer calls.  For example, if 
 a definition includes <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (ST)))</span> then the guard of 
 the function is changed by the addition of the conjunct <span class="v">(ST-P ST)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>One impact of this is that if you use the built-in ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> as a 
 formal parameter of a function, <span class="v">(STATE-P STATE)</span> is added to the guard. 
 This may introduce a guard where there was none in previous versions of the 
 system.  In older versions, therefore, no attempt would be made to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span>, while in the new version, we would attempt guard verification. 
 You may wish to add <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :verify-guards nil))</span> to such 
 definitions.</p> 
 
 <p>A related change affects users who do not use stobjs or <span class="v">state</span>.  In 
 previous versions of the system — as now — a <span class="v">type</span> declaration 
 extended the guard you provided explicitly.  Thus, if you wrote <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">type</a> integer n))</span> then <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">INTEGERP</a> n)</span> was added to your guard.  This is 
 still the case and <span class="v">:stobjs</span> recognizers are similarly added.  But in older 
 versions of the system we ``added'' the conjuncts without checking whether 
 they were already present in the guard you provided.  This sometimes produced 
 such guards as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> n) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> n))</span> where the first was 
 produced by your <span class="v">type</span> declaration and the second was your <span class="v">:guard</span>. 
 We now eliminate redundant conjuncts; this may rearrange the order of the 
 conjuncts.</p> 
 
 <p>The guard conjectures for functions using <span class="v">stobj</span>s have been simplified 
 somewhat by taking advantage of the syntactic restrictions checked for 
 single-threaded objects.</p> 
 
 <p>The following functions have been modified so that character and string 
 arguments are restricted to standard characters.  (See <a href="COMMON-LISP____STANDARD-CHAR-P.html">standard-char-p</a> 
 and see <a href="ACL2____STANDARD-CHAR-LISTP.html">standard-char-listp</a>.)</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____UPPER-CASE-P.html">upper-case-p</a></span> <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LOWER-CASE-P.html">lower-case-p</a></span> <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-UPCASE.html">char-upcase</a></span> <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-DOWNCASE.html">char-downcase</a></span> <span class="v">string-downcase1</span> <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____STRING-DOWNCASE.html">string-downcase</a></span> 
 <span class="v">string-upcase1</span> <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____STRING-UPCASE.html">string-upcase</a></span> <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-EQUAL.html">char-equal</a></span> 
 <span class="v">string-equal1</span> <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____STRING-EQUAL.html">string-equal</a></span></p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>Also, function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-STRING-ALISTP.html">standard-string-alistp</a></span> replaces function 
 <span class="v">string-alistp</span>, with concomitant changes in the guard to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSOC-STRING-EQUAL.html">assoc-string-equal</a></span>, and in variable <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>.  Also, lemma 
 <span class="v">standard-string-alistp-forward-to-alistp</span> replaces lemma 
 <span class="v">string-alistp-forward-to-alistp</span>.  There is a new lemma 
 <span class="v">standard-char-p-nth</span>, which has also been added to 
 <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The guard had been inadvertently omitted from the definition of the 
 function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SUBSTITUTE.html">substitute</a></span> (and its subroutine <span class="v">substitute-ac</span>).  This 
 omission has been corrected; also, the guard is slightly stronger than the 
 documentation had claimed (and that has been corrected).</p>
