<p>Abstract syntax of PFCS.</p><p>Expressions are built out of 
     constants, variables, and field operations. 
     A constraint is an equality between expressions. 
     Constraints may be (conjunctively) grouped into named relations 
     (see <span class="tt"><a href="PFCS____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>), 
     which may be conjoined with equality constraints. 
     A system of constraints is a collection of named relations, 
     which are hierarchically organized.</p>
