<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=XDOC____ARCHIVE-MATCHING-TOPICS">Click for Archive-matching-topics in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>An event that saves documentation from certain events, filtered by customizable criteria.</p> <p>This event has a similar purpose to that of <a href="XDOC____ARCHIVE-XDOC.html">archive-xdoc</a>. 
However, instead of acting on the new xdoc topics that are created by some set 
of local events, it acts on all existing topics that fit some matching 
criterion.</p> 
 
<p>Usage: <span class="v">&lt;term&gt;</span> must be a term that uses a variable named X (in any 
package); it may also use <span class="v">acl2::world</span> and <span class="v">acl2::state</span>.  The following 
form preprocesses all existing xdoc topics for which term returns 
true (non-NIL) when the topic is bound to X and the current acl2 world and 
state are bound to world and state, respectively.</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="XDOC____ARCHIVE-MATCHING-TOPICS.html">archive-matching-topics</a> &lt;term&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>Thus the following could be put in a book that, when included, loads all the 
documentation from <span class="v">std/strings</span> but does not load the actual functions and 
events from there:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "xdoc/archive-matching-topics" :dir :system)
(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/strings/top" :dir :system))

(<a href="XDOC____ARCHIVE-MATCHING-TOPICS.html">archive-matching-topics</a> (<a href="STR____STRPREFIXP.html">str::strprefixp</a> "[books]/std/strings/" (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ASSOC.html">assoc</a> :from x))))</pre> 
 
<p>The topics that are archived by this event may be ones that were process 
assumes that at the point of saving the xdoc, the definitions referenced in 
these preprocessor forms exist and the @(`...`) forms can be evaluated.  If 
the documentation loaded in the archive-xdoc form references definitions that 
aren't loaded, then the preprocessing will produce xdoc-errors and leave notes 
behind in the documentation saying that those definitions couldn't be 
found.</p>
