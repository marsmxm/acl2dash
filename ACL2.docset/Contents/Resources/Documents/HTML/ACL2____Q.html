<p>Quit ACL2 (type <span class="v">:q</span>) â€” reenter with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a>)</span></p><pre class="code">Example:
ACL2 !&gt;:Q</pre> 
 
 <p>The keyword command <span class="v">:q</span> typed at the top-level of the ACL2 loop will 
 terminate the loop and return control to the Common Lisp top-level (or, more 
 precisely, to whatever program invoked <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span>).  To reenter the ACL2 loop, 
 execute <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LP.html">acl2::lp</a>)</span> in Common Lisp.  You will be in the same state as you 
 were when you exited with <span class="v">:q</span>, unless during your stay in Common Lisp you 
 messed with the data structures representing the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> (including 
 files, property lists, and single-threaded objects).</p> 
 
 <p>Unlike all other keyword commands, typing <span class="v">:q</span> is not equivalent to 
 invoking the function <span class="v">q</span>.  There is no function <span class="v">q</span>.</p>
