<p>Dynamic semantics of Yul.</p><p>We define the dynamic semantics of Yul 
     by formalizing the Yul computation state 
     and by defining ACL2 functions that manipulate the computation state 
     via execution of the Yul abstract syntax. 
     The formalization also involves a function environment 
     that includes the Yul functions in scope, 
     and that is manipulated along with the computation state.</p><p>This is based on the formal specification in 
     [Yul: Specification of Yul: Formal Specification], 
     which defines an interpreter for Yul.</p><p>We formalize a big-step interpretive semantics, 
     which consists of mutually recursive execution functions. 
     To ensure their termination, as required by ACL2, 
     these functions take a limit argument 
     that is decremented at each recursive call. 
     This is an artificial limit, 
     that has no counterpart in the run-time data of an executing Yul program. 
     Formal proofs need to deal with this limit, 
     e.g. the termination of a Yul program is proved 
     by showing that there is a suitable limit that does not run out.</p>
