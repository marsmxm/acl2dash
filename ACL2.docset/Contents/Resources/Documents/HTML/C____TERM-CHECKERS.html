<p>Checkers of ACL2 terms that represent C constructs.</p><p>The shallow embedding of C in ACL2 defines 
     representations of C constructs in ACL2. 
     These are used by <span class="tt"><a href="C____ATC.html">atc</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="C____DEFOBJECT.html">defobject</a></span>, 
     which check ACL2 terms to see if they represent C constructs, 
     returning appropriate information if that is the case.</p><p>Here we collect some of this checking code on terms, 
     which is common to <span class="tt"><a href="C____ATC.html">atc</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="C____DEFOBJECT.html">defobject</a></span>. 
     We plan to organize all of this code more systematically at some point.</p>
