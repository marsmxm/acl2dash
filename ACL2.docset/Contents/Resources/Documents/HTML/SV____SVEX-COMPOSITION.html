<p>The process of composing together a netlist of svex assignments into 
full update functions.</p> 
<p>Suppose we have a module with a lot of assignment statements. We want to 
compose together the RHS expressions in order to get the update formula for 
each wire, in terms of the PIs and registers.</p> 
 
<p>One basic thing to do is DFS through each of the expressions, building full 
update formulas.  Every time we get to a wire, either it is a PI/register or 
another internal wire.  If it is a PI/register, we leave it; if it's an 
internal wire, either we've seen it before and computed some formula for it, 
or we descend into its update formula and compute that first.</p> 
 
<p>Two kinds of problems arise when using this strategy. First, there might be 
variable-level self-loops, e.g.:</p> 
<pre class="code">wire [5:0] a = b | (a[4:0] &lt;&lt; 1);</pre> 
 
<p>Here, <span class="v">a</span> looks like a has a self-loop, but in fact each bit only 
depends on previous bits, so the loop can be unrolled into a combinational 
formula.  This represents a third possibility for when we encounter an 
internal wire: we've encountered it before, but haven't finished computing a 
formula for it.</p> 
 
<p>Second, there might be bit-level self-loops. These are bad news but they 
do sometimes come up, e.g. in latch-based (as opposed to flipflop-based) logic 
as well as with clock gating where the clock gate signal depends on the output 
of a register that it gates (depending on how the clock gate is represented in 
the logic).</p> 
 
<p>To deal with these two problems, we do two further steps after the initial 
simple DFS composition step; step 2 effectively deals with variable-level 
self-loops and step 3 deals with bit-level self-loops.  The full sequence of 
steps:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>1. Simple depth-first search composition, stopping whenever we reach a 
variable that is still in the stack.</li> 
 
<li>2. Iterative self-composition of the remaining signals, using caremasks to 
determine when a variable needs to be composed in.  This is implemented in as 
<span class="v">svex-alist-maskcompose-iter</span> in "mask-compose.lisp".</li> 
 
<li>3. Break up into bits any remaining internal signals that other signals 
still depend on, then find strongly-connected components of the bit-level 
dependency graph and try to self-compose those components enough times to 
resolve further dependencies.  Then translate the decomposed signals back into 
the original namespace.</li> 
 
<li>4. Finally, replace any remaining internal signal dependencies with Xes.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>This is implemented <span class="v">svex-assigns-compose</span>.</p>
