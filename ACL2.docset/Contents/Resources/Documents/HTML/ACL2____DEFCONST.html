<p>Define a constant</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> *my-digits* '(0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> *len-my-digits* (<a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a> unsigned-byte (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> *my-digits*)))

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> name term)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">name</span> is a symbol beginning and ending with the character <span class="v">*</span> 
 and <span class="v">term</span> is a variable-free term that is evaluated to determine the value 
 of the constant.</p> 
 
 <p>There are two restrictions on <span class="v">term</span> aside from it being variable-free. 
 Both restrictions relate to ancestral uses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> in <span class="v">term</span>, i.e., 
 uses of <span class="v">apply$</span> by <span class="v">term</span> or any function that might be called during the 
 evaluation of <span class="v">term</span>.  First, only badged primitive functions may be 
 applied.  See <a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> for a way to obtain the complete list of badged 
 primitives.  Second, <span class="v">loop$</span> and <span class="v">lambda$</span> may not be used anywhere in 
 the ancestry of term.  See <span class="v">ignored-attachment</span> and 
 <span class="v">prohibition-of-loop$-and-lambda$</span> for more discussion.</p> 
 
 <p>When a constant symbol is used as a <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>, ACL2 replaces it by its 
 value; see <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">defconst</span> uses so-called <a href="ACL2____SAFE-MODE.html">safe-mode</a> to evaluate its 
 form, in order to avoids soundness issues but with an efficiency penalty 
 (perhaps increasing the evaluation time by several hundred percent).  If 
 efficiency is a concern, or if for some reason you need the form to be 
 evaluated without safe mode (e.g., you are an advanced system hacker using 
 trust tags to traffic in raw Lisp code), consider using <a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a> 
 instead.  Also see <a href="ACL2____USING-TABLES-EFFICIENTLY.html">using-tables-efficiently</a> for an analogous issue with 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span> events.</p> 
 
 <p>It may be of interest to note that <span class="v">defconst</span> is implemented at the lisp 
 level using <span class="v">defparameter</span>, as opposed to <span class="v">defconstant</span>. 
 (Implementation note: this is important for proper support of undoing and 
 redefinition.)</p> 
 
 <p>We close with a technical remark, perhaps of interest only who make use of 
 the <a href="ACL2____HONS-ENABLED.html">hons-enabled</a> features of ACL2.  For an event of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> *C* (<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a> OBJ))</span>, i.e., <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> *C* 'OBJ)</span>, then the 
 value associated with <span class="v">*C*</span> is <span class="v">OBJ</span>; that is, the value of <span class="v">*C*</span> is 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span> to the actual object <span class="v">OBJ</span> occurring in the <span class="v">defconst</span> form. 
 So for example, if <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> is used to generate such a <span class="v">defconst</span> 
 event, as it is in the two books mentioned above, and <span class="v">OBJ</span> is a fast 
 alist (see <a href="ACL2____FAST-ALISTS.html">fast-alists</a>), then the value of <span class="v">*C*</span> is a fast alist. 
 This guarantee disappears if the term in the <span class="v">defconst</span> form is not a 
 quoted object, i.e., if it is not of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a> OBJ)</span>.</p>
