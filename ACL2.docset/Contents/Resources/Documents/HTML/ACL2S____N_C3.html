<p>The well-founded less-than relation on natural numbers.</p><p> 
If <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span> are both natural numbers then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2S____N_C3.html">n&lt;</a> x y)</span> is true 
iff <span class="v">x</span> is strictly less than <span class="v">y</span>. <span class="v">n&lt;</span> is well-founded on the natural 
numbers and is useful for beginners who want to use measure 
functions over natural numbers.
