<p>Introduce an <a href="CRYPTO____INTERFACES.html">interface</a> for a password-based key derivation function 2 (PBKDF2).</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>PBKDF2 is specified in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8018" target="_blank"><nobr>RFC 8018 standard<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8018"></nobr></a>. It is parameterized over a pseudorandom function, 
     i.e. there is a PBKDF2 variant 
     for each choice of the pseudorandom function. 
     RFC 8018 assumes the pseudorandom function to be a binary function, 
     since it is applied to two arguments (see Section 5.2 of RFC 8018).</p><p>This macro introduces a weakly constrained ACL2 function 
     for a PBKDF2 function; 
     the underlying pseudorandom function is specified via a reference to 
     the name of an existing <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-HMAC.html">definterface-hmac</a></span>. 
     For now, only HMAC functions are supported 
     as choices for the PBKDF2's pseudorandom function. 
     The PBKDF2 function takes as arguments 
     two byte lists (the password and the salt) 
     and two positive integers (the iteration count and the key length); 
     the use of bytes (vs. bits, or strings) is consistent with RFC 8108. 
     The guard of the function requires the arguments 
     to be byte lists and positive integers. 
     The function is constrained to fix its arguments 
     to byte lists and positive integers, 
     and to return a byte list whose size is 
     the key length specified by the argument.</p><p>The password of the PBKDF2 function 
     is used as the key of the underlying HMAC function 
     according to RFC 8108. 
     Thus, if the HMAC function has a limit (derived from the hash function) 
     on the size of the keys it accepts, 
     the same limit applies to the password of the PBKDF2 function 
     and is added to the guard of the PBKDF2 function.</p><p>If the hash function has an input size limit, 
     the limit on the size of the HMAC function's text input 
     is as explained in <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-HMAC.html">definterface-hmac</a></span>. 
     RFC 8108 says that the text passed to the HMAC function is 
     either (i) the salt concatenated with 4 bytes 
     or (ii) an output of the HMAC function: 
     while the latter is always well below the HMAC text size limit, 
     the former induces the constraint that the salt 
     must be below the limit for the HMAC text (see <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-HMAC.html">definterface-hmac</a></span>) 
     diminished by 4. 
     The guard of the PBKDF2 function includes this constraint, 
     if applicable.</p><p>RFC 8108 says that the desired key length must not exceed 
     (2^{32}-1) times the output size of the HMAC function. 
     This is part of the guard of the PBKDF2 function.</p><p>This macro also introduces a few theorems 
     that follow from the constraints. 
     It also introduces an XDOC topic for the generated 
     function, constraints, and theorems.</p><h3>General Form</h3><pre class="code">(<a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-PBKDF2.html">definterface-pbkdf2</a> name

<p>A constrained function that represents the PBKDF2 function.</p>
<p>Its guard consists of 
      <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LISTP.html">byte-listp</a></span> for the password and salt arguments, 
      <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POSP.html">posp</a></span> for the iteration and length arguments, and 
      if applicable, conditions on the length of the password and salt 
      derived as explained above.</p>
<p>This function is constrained to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LISTP.html">byte-listp</a></span> 
       of length equal to the length argument.</li>
<li>Fix its inputs to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LISTP.html">byte-listp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POSP.html">posp</a></span> as appropriate.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following additional theorems are also generated:</p>
<ul>
<li>A type prescription rules saying that 
        the function returns a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></span>.</li>
<li>A type prescription rule saying that 
        the function returns a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span>.</li>
