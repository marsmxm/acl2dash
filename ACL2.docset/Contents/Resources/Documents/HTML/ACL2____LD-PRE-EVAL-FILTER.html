<p>Determines which forms <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> evaluates</p><p><span class="v">Ld-pre-eval-filter</span> is an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> special (see <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a>). 
 The accessor is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LD-PRE-EVAL-FILTER.html">ld-pre-eval-filter</a> state)</span> and the updater is 
 <span class="v">(set-ld-pre-eval-filter val state)</span>.  <span class="v">Ld-pre-eval-filter</span> must be 
 either <span class="v">:all</span>, <span class="v">:query</span>, or a new name that could be defined (e.g., by 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span>).  (There is actually a value that may on 
 rare occasions be set by the ACL2 system, <span class="v">:illegal-state</span>; we ignore that 
 value here, but the curious reader is welcome to see <a href="ACL2____ILLEGAL-STATE.html">illegal-state</a>.) 
 The initial value of <span class="v">ld-pre-eval-filter</span> is <span class="v">:all</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The general-purpose ACL2 read-eval-print loop, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>, reads forms from 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a></span>, evaluates them and prints the result to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-CO.html">standard-co</a></span>.  Note that the ACL2 top-level loop (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span>) results from 
 an invocation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>However, there are various flags that control <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>'s behavior and 
 <span class="v">ld-pre-eval-filter</span> is one of them.  If the filter is <span class="v">:all</span>, then 
 every form read is evaluated.  If the filter is <span class="v">:query</span>, then after a form 
 is read it is printed to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-CO.html">standard-co</a></span> and the user is asked if the form 
 is to be evaluated or skipped.  If the filter is a new name, then all forms 
 are evaluated until that name is introduced, at which time <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> 
 terminates normally.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:all</span> filter is, of course, the normal one.  <span class="v">:Query</span> is useful 
 if you want to replay selected the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s in some file.  The new name 
 filter is used if you wish to replay all the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s in a file up 
 through the introduction of the given one.</p>
