<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____STD_F2IO">Click for Std/io in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A library for reasoning about file input/output operations.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">std/io</span> library provides:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Basic lemmas about low-level, built-in ACL2 <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a> operations like <a href="ACL2____OPEN-INPUT-CHANNEL.html">open-input-channel</a>, <a href="ACL2____READ-BYTE_42.html">read-byte$</a>, <a href="ACL2____CLOSE-OUTPUT-CHANNEL.html">close-output-channel</a>, and so 
on.  (These are especially useful for guard proofs about IO functions.)</li> 
 
<li>A <a href="ACL2____FILE-MEASURE.html">file-measure</a> for proving the termination of functions that read 
from files.</li> 
 
<li>Extended low-level file input operations such as <a href="ACL2____READ-BYTES_42.html">read-bytes$</a>, which 
lets you efficiently read 16-, 32-, and 64-bits from a file at once.</li> 
 
<li>High-level operations for reading whole files, such as <a href="ACL2____READ-FILE-BYTES.html">read-file-bytes</a>, <a href="ACL2____READ-FILE-CHARACTERS.html">read-file-characters</a>, and <a href="ACL2____READ-FILE-OBJECTS.html">read-file-objects</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Some basic information about low-level i/o facilities in ACL2 can be found 
in <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a>, and for some  and also <a href="ACL2____LOGICAL-STORY-OF-IO.html">logical-story-of-io</a>.</p> 
 
<h3>Loading the Library</h3> 
 
<p>If you just want to load the whole IO library, you can include the <span class="v">top</span> 
book, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/io/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>But this may be more than you need.  The library is split up into sensible 
books that can generally be loaded individually.</p>
