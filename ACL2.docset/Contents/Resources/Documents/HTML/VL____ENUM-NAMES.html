<p>Making sense of the names defined by enum types.</p><p>Enum types are unique among datatypes in that using one has a side 
effect of declaring some names with assigned values.  We deal with these early 
on, as part of <a href="VL____ANNOTATE.html">annotate</a>, by declaring these names as parameters.  For 
example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">typedef enum logic [3:0] { red=1, blue, green, yellow[4:0]=5, orange[3:5] };</pre> 
 
<p>results in the following parameter declarations:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">localparam logic [3:0] red = 1;
localparam logic [3:0] blue = red + 1;
localparam logic [3:0] green = blue + 1;
localparam logic [3:0] yellow4 = 5;
localparam logic [3:0] yellow3 = 6;
localparam logic [3:0] yellow2 = 7;
localparam logic [3:0] yellow1 = 8;
localparam logic [3:0] yellow0 = 9;
localparam logic [3:0] orange3 = 10;
localparam logic [3:0] orange4 = 11;
localparam logic [3:0] orange5 = 12;</pre> 
 
<p>We require the range indices (e.g. for <span class="v">yellow[4:0]</span>, <span class="v">orange[3:5]</span> to 
be constants (syntactically), which ncverilog does as well.  VCS is somewhat 
more forgiving, but still doesn't allow arbitrary constant expressions; i.e., 
it seems you can't call a function in there.</p> 
 
<p>The above example illustrates how we create parameters for the names 
declared in an enum type.  This transformation then applies this to every enum 
found in the datatype of a variable, parameter, or typedef declaration.</p>
