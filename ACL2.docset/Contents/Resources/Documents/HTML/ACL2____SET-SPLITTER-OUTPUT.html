<p>Turn on or off reporting of rules that may have caused case splits</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">set-splitter-output</a> t)   ; enable  reports of ``splitter'' rules (<a href="ACL2____DEFAULT.html">default</a>)
(<a href="ACL2____SET-SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">set-splitter-output</a> nil) ; disable reports of ``splitter'' rules</pre> 
 
 <p>After evaluation of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">set-splitter-output</a> t)</span> (the default), 
 then whenever <span class="v">prove</span> output is not inhibited (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>), ACL2 will report <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> and <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> rules that may have reduced a goal to more than one subgoal.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____SPLITTER.html">splitter</a> for how to interpret such reports.  We call such rules 
 ``splitter rules'' for the goal that is being split.  This information can be 
 useful in deciding how to eliminate large splits, for example of Goal into 
 Subgoal 1000 through Subgoal 1, by disabling some splitter rules.  If you want 
 to avoid the printing of such information, you can put the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">set-splitter-output</a> t)</span> in your customization file; see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION.html">ACL2-customization</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that this command does not change the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>; it only 
 modifies the <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  More precisely, it sets a state global to the 
 indicated value.  (See <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> for discussion of the ``global-table'' of 
 the state.)  When <span class="v">prove</span> output is enabled (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>), the value of that state global is the value of the 
 form <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">splitter-output</a></span><span class="v">)</span>; otherwise the value of that form is 
 <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Again, see <a href="ACL2____SPLITTER.html">splitter</a> for the effects of turning on the reporting of 
 splitter rules.</p>
