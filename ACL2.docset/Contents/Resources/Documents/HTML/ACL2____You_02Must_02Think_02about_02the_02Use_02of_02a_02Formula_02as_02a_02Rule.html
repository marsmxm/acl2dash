<p>You Must Think about the Use of a Formula as a Rule</p><p><a href="ACL2____Using_02the_02Associativity_02of_02App_02to_02Prove_02a_02Trivial_02Consequence.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/walking.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>This is <b>good</b> and <b>bad</b>.</p> 
 
 <p>The good news is that you can <b>program</b> ACL2's simplifier.</p> 
 
 <p>The bad news is that when you command ACL2 to prove a theorem you must give 
 some thought to <b>how that theorem is to be used as a rule</b>!</p> 
 
 <p>For example, if after proving <span class="v">associativity-of-app</span> as previously 
 shown, you engaged in the mathematically trivial act of proving it again but 
 with the equality reversed, you would have programmed ACL2's rewriter to loop 
 forever.</p> 
 
 <p>You can avoid adding any rule by using the command:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defthm associativity-of-app 
  (equal (app (app a b) c) 
         (app a (app b c))) 
  <b>:rule-classes nil</b>) 
</pre>
