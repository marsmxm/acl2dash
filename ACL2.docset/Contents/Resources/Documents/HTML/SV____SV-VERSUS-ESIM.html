<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=SV____SV-VERSUS-ESIM">Click for Sv-versus-esim in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A quick comparison of <a href="ACL2____SV.html">sv</a> and its predecessor, <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>.</p><p>SV and ESIM have many similarities.  For instance:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>They largely share the same goal: to provide a representation for (RTL) 
hardware designs that can be automatically derived from Verilog/SystemVerilog, 
can be concretely or symbolically simulated, and can be formally analyzed by 
ACL2.</li> 
 
<li>They are both, like Verilog or SystemVerilog, based on four-valued logics 
where each ``bit'' of a wire can be either 1, 0, X, or Z; see <a href="ACL2____WHY-4V-LOGIC.html">ACL2::why-4v-logic</a> for additional background on why four-valued logics are 
useful in hardware modeling.</li> 
 
<li>They both provide similar user-interfacing tools.  For instance, the <a href="SV____SYMBOLIC-TEST-VECTOR.html">symbolic-test-vector</a>s of SV are intentionally very similar to the symbolic 
test vectors of ESIM.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>However, SV and ESIM have significantly different implementations.  Below, 
we discuss some of these differences, their motivations, and their 
consequences.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Expression Language</h3> 
 
<p>ESIM is a <b>bit-level</b> backend.  That is, the expression language used 
by ESIM is <a href="ACL2____4V.html">4v</a>.  Each expression in this language represents a 
single (four-valued) bit.</p> 
 
<p>In contrast, SV is a <span class="v">vector-level</span> backend.  In its expression 
language, <a href="SV____SVEX.html">svex</a>, each expression represents a (4-valued) bit vector, 
somewhat similar to a bignum representation.  In particular, the values taken 
by its expressions are represented by <a href="SV____4VEC.html">4vec</a> structures, each of which is 
essentially a pair of integers.</p> 
 
<p>The main motivation for this change was to make it easier to translate large 
Verilog/SystemVerilog designs with reasonable performance.  In ESIM, 
bit-blasting every expression has proven to be a major performance 
bottleneck...</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>In some cases it requires the creation of millions of symbols.  This could 
be slow just to <a href="COMMON-LISP____INTERN.html">intern</a>.  We typically built ACL2 with a much larger 
<span class="v">ACL2</span> <a href="COMMON-LISP____PACKAGE.html">package</a> to improve performance.</li> 
 
<li>These symbols were (of course) then consed together into various 
structures, which could become large and require lots of memory to 
represent (and to <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>).</li> 
 
<li>We needed separate expressions for each bit of the circuit.  For instance, 
an assignment like <span class="v">assign foo[7:0] = bar[7:0] &amp; baz[7:0]</span> would require 
eight separate, distinct <span class="v">and</span> expressions, i.e., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> bar[7] baz[7])</span>, 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> bar[6] baz[6])</span>, ...; each of these were <a href="ACL2____4V-SEXPRS.html">ACL2::4v-sexprs</a>, which 
were typically <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>es, so there is a significant memory cost.</li> 
 
<li>Traversing so many individual bit expressions adds significant time 
overhead for algorithms such as evaluating, reducing, topologically sorting and 
composing update functions, etc., as well as much larger memo tables.</li> 
 
<li>It takes some memory to record the association of Verilog-level vectors to 
their corresponding bits, and some computation to reassemble vectors out of 
their bits, which you need to do in tools like waveform dumping and symbolic 
test vector processing.</li> 
 
<li>There are other undesirable consequences for the front-end (i.e., Verilog 
translation), which we will come back to later.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>A vector-level language largely avoids these problems.  Since each variable 
represents an entire vector, we need far fewer symbols and expressions, and 
correspondingly far less memory is needed to represent structures such as the 
state of the circuit at a particular instant in time and its update functions. 
The symbolic expressions for our update functions are also more compact, 
requiring less memory for memo tables and less time for traversals.  We don't 
need to track associations between vectors and their individual bits for 
waveforms/etc., which further reduces memory overhead and computation time.</p> 
 
<p>A vector-level expression language also may lend itself to more specialized 
reasoning strategies than just bit-blasting.  <a href="SV____BIT-BLASTING.html">Bit-blasting</a> is still an 
important tool and is still well-supported by SV, but delaying bit-blasting 
opens up opportunities for certain kinds of vector-level analysis such as <a href="SV____REWRITING.html">rewriting</a>.</p> 
 
 
 
 
<h3>Module Representations</h3> 
 
<p>In ESIM's module representation, each module is either:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>a primitive, defined by an explicit representation of outputs/next-state 
bits in terms of inputs/previous-states, or</li> 
 
<li>a compound module, defined by a list of submodule instances.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This approach meant that to translate a typical Verilog module containing 
assignments as well as submodules, the assignments first needed to be broken 
down and represented as a series of submodules themselves.  Historically this 
was done by <a href="ACL2____VL2014.html">vl2014</a> transforms such as in the <a href="VL2014____SPLIT.html">vl2014::split</a> and 
<a href="VL2014____OCCFORM.html">vl2014::occform</a>.</p> 
 
<p>In SV, we eliminate this process by directly representing assignments of 
expressions to wires in the modules; this removes the need for these two steps, 
and helps to make the actual SV representation look more like the original 
Verilog.  (Well, slightly, anyway.)</p> 
 
 
<h3>Flattening</h3> 
 
<p>One advantage of ESIM's module representation is that the semantics of a 
module hierarchy are relatively straightforward and well-defined: each module 
has its output and next-state functions in terms of its inputs and previous 
states, and the functions for a parent module are computed by taking a fixpoint 
of the compositions of the functions of all submodules.</p> 
 
<p>In SV, rather than expressing the semantics in terms of a module hierarchy, 
only the expression language has a real concrete interpretation.  To obtain the 
meaning of a module hierarchy, we first <b>flatten</b> it and resolve aliasing 
between wires, obtaining a flattened set of assignments and state updates.  We 
then compose these together to obtain update functions for each wire and state 
element in terms of primary inputs and previous states.</p> 
 
<p>While arguably some meaning is lost here—the flattening and 
alias-normalization transforms are sufficiently complicated that we can't claim 
that the module hierarchy has a nice, crisp semantics—an important 
advantage is that this process offers a much simpler way to deal with Verilog 
constructs that violate the module hierarchy.  For example, consider a Verilog 
assignment to a hierarchical identifier.  This sort of construct can't be 
accommodated in ESIM without drastically modifying its simple, elegant 
hierarchical semantics, but it is fairly straightforward in SV.</p> 
 
<p>Meanwhile, ESIM's support for bidirectionally-driven wires relies on a 
subtle, unverified transformation to the module hierarchy which is necessary to 
ensure a fundamental assumption that every wire has only one driving module. 
In contrast, with SV's flattening approach, a wire that is bidirectionally 
driven reduces to one that is just multiply driven; it is relatively easy to 
resolve any multiply-driven wires after flattening and before composition.</p> 
 
 
<h3>SystemVerilog support</h3> 
 
<p>SV's approach to deriving an FSM from a module hierarchy via flattening, 
alias normalization, and composition has proven to be very convenient for 
expressing many SystemVerilog features such as compound data structures. 
Thanks to this, SV can support a richer set of SystemVerilog designs than 
ESIM.</p> 
 
<h3>Performance statistics</h3> 
 
<p>The following timings and performance discussion are for one of <a href="http://www.oracle.com" target="_blank"><nobr>Oracle<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.oracle.com"></nobr></a>'s main hardware proof stacks. 
Perhaps these statistics should be taken lightly, as they were only single 
runs, and it's possible (though somewhat unlikely) that there was contention 
for the cores.  These were run with <span class="v">-j 1</span>. 
 
The reported "user" time is only the time that ACL2 itself was running.  The 
time spent in the SAT solver is left out of the "user" time but very 
relevant.  As such, we focus on the wall-clock time.</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>In Esim:  12 hours and 14 minutes of time<br> 
<span class="v">19758.892u 434.856s 12:14:18.48 45.8% 0+0k 692208+2144728io 18pf+0w</span> 
</li> 
<li>In SV: 7 hours and 7 minutes of time<br> 
<span class="v">16128.279u 410.741s 7:07:16.04 64.5% 0+0k 520448+1000408io 12pf+0w</span>
</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Generally speaking, proofs are either the same speed or faster under the SV 
framework.  One composition (<a href="SV____SVEX-DECOMP.html">svex-decomp</a>) proof using <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> (which is the old method for doing such proofs) took approximately 
5386 seconds in Esim and now takes 69 seconds in SV.  As another example, one 
proof that describes the functionality of a Verilog circuit took 166 seconds in 
Esim and now takes 170 seconds in SV.</p>
