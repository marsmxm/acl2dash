<p>An ACL2 library for Yul.</p><p>Yul is a programming language, 
     which is being used as an intermediate language 
     in the compilation of <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Ethereum<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://ethereum.org"></nobr></a> smart contracts written in in the Solidity language. 
     However, Yul is designed to be more general than Solidity, 
     and may find additional uses soon.</p><p>This ACL2 library for Yul is being developed 
     to provide a formalization of Yul in ACL2, 
     as well as tools related to Yul and ACL2. 
     This library is work in progress.</p><p>Yul is currently documented as part of the <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/" target="_blank"><nobr>Solidity documentation<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/"></nobr></a>, precisely in the <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html" target="_blank"><nobr>`Yul' section of the Solidity documentation<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/yul.html"></nobr></a>. However, since Yul is designed to be more general than Solidity, 
     it is possible that eventually it may have its own documentation.</p><p>In the documentation of this ACL2 library, 
     the Yul documentation (part of the Solidity documentation) 
     is referenced as `[Yul]`; 
     subsections of it are referenced by appending 
     by appending their titles separated by colons,  e.g. 
     `[Yul: Specification of Yul: Scoping Rules]`. 
     These square-bracketed references may be used 
     as nouns or parenthetically.</p><p>Since some aspects of Yul are described 
     in part of the Solidity documentation that is not [Yul], 
     we also reference (the rest of) the Solidity documentation, 
     which we do as `[Solidity]' and `[Solidity: ...]', 
     similarly to how we reference the Yul documentation proper.</p>
