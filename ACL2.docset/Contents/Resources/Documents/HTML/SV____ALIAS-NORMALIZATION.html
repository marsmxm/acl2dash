<p>The process of computing a canonical form for each wire in the module hierarchy.</p><p>Alias normalization takes as input a list of pairs of <a href="SV____LHS.html">lhs</a> 
objects and computes a canonical form for each wire mentioned.  The inputs must 
be in indexed-variable form; that is, each variable name must be a unique 
natural number (this allows us to use arrays to look up variable 
properties).</p> 
 
<p>The normalization algorithm is similar to a disjoint sets union-find 
algorithm.  Initially, every wire is mapped to itself.  For each alias pair, we 
canonicalize the two LHS objects according to our current mapping.  That is, 
for each wire range in the LHS, we look up the current mapping of the wire, 
truncate it to the relevant range, and recursively canonicalize that, stopping 
on ranges that are mapped to themselves.  (In order that this process 
terminates, it is an invariant that every subrange of every wire is mapped to a 
range of a wire whose index is less than or equal to the index of that wire; 
and if mapped to itself, then to either a lower range of bits or just to 
itself.)</p> 
 
<p>Then, when we have normalized the two LHSes, we break this pairing down into 
pairs of single wire ranges.  For example, if our two normalized LHSes are <span class="v">{
a[5:4], b[7:3] }</span> and <span class="v">{ c[8:5], d[9:7] }</span>, these would be broken down into 
the pairs:</p> 
<pre class="code">(a[5:4], c[8:7]),
   (b[7:6], c[6:5]),
   (b[5:3], d[9:7]).</pre> 
 
<p>For each of these range pairs, unless the two elements are the same, we set 
the canonical version of one to the other, chosen so that the ordering 
invariant is maintained.</p> 
 
<p>To finish processing the current alias pair, we again recursively 
canonicalize the original pair of LHS objects.  However, now, whenever we find 
the canonical version of a wire range, we replace the mapping for that wire 
range with the canonical version found.  As in the union-find algorithm, this 
is a performance optimization to minimize the number of steps necessary in 
future searches.</p> 
 
<p>Once all alias pairs are processed like this, we finish by doing a linear 
sweep over all entries in the table, replacing every wire range by its 
canonical representation.</p> 
 
<h5>Correctness of the algorithm</h5> 
 
<p>We haven't proved the algorithm correct.  Here are some thoughts on the topic.</p> 
 
<p>The correctness statement is something like the following.</p> 
 
<p>If v and w are each a bit selected from some wire, then <span class="v">canon(v) =
canon(<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a>)</span> iff there exists a path <span class="v">v0, ..., vn</span> where:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">v0 = v</span> and <span class="v">vn = w</span>
</li> 
<li>for all <span class="v">i</span> from 0 to <span class="v">n-1</span>, there exists an alias pair such that 
<span class="v">vi</span> and <span class="v">vi+1</span> are corresponding bits in the two LHS objects of the 
pair.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>During the main loop of the algorithm (i.e. between processing alias pairs), 
this property holds of the alias pairs processed so far, if we regard 
<span class="v">canon(v)</span> as recursive canonicalization of <span class="v">v</span> as opposed to a single 
lookup.  Inductive argument:</p> 
 
<p>Base case: we haven't processed any alias pairs yet; by the initial setting 
of the mapping, <span class="v">canon(v) = canon(<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a>)</span> iff <span class="v">v == w</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Inductive case: Suppose the property holds before adding an alias pair, and 
show it holds after adding it.</p> 
 
<p>Backward direction: Show that if a path exists from v to w, then the 
canonical forms are equal.</p> 
 
<p>Lemma: If <span class="v">canon(v) = canon(<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a>)</span> before, then this is true after.  We only 
change the mapping for values that are canonical, which only adds 
equivalences (unions sets), or for non-canonical values by replacing their 
mapping with their canonical values, which preserves equivalences.</p> 
 
<p>So if the path exists without our new alias pair, then by I.H. the canonical 
forms are equal before, so they are equal after as well.  So we only need to 
consider the case where the path uses our new alias pair.  Basically, it 
suffices to show that as we process the alias pair, we equalize the canonical 
forms of corresponding bits.  So since each link in the path is corresponding 
bits of a pair, they have equal canonical representations.</p> 
 
<p>Forward direction: If there is no path, then the canonical forms differ.  To 
prove this, we assume the canonical forms are the same and produce a path.  We 
only need to consider v, w whose canonical forms are newly equal: if they were 
equal before then there was a path before by IH, and that same path works now. 
The only operation that equalizes new pairs is that we set a canonical range to 
the corresponding canonical range of the other LHS.</p> 
 
<p>Lemma: Setting a canonical range to another range only affects the canonical 
form of bits whose canonical form was in that range.</p> 
 
<p>Bits whose canonical form was in the changed range (by IH) have a path to 
corresponding bits of that range.  The part of the original LHS that mapped to 
that range also has such a path.  Concatenate these two, step over the current 
alias to some bit whose canonical form already was the new canonical form in 
question -- so then concatenate on that bit's path to w.  Got that?</p>
