<p>A book a definitions of logical operations on numbers.</p><p>This book, along with <a href="ACL2____LOGOPS-LEMMAS.html">logops-lemmas</a>, includes a theory of 
the Common Lisp logical operations on numbers, a portable implementation of the 
Common Lisp byte operations, extensions to those theories, and some useful 
macros.</p> 
 
<p>This book contains only definitions, lemmas necessary to admit those 
definitions, and selected type lemmas.  By "type lemmas" we mean any lemmas 
about the logical operations that we have found necessary to verify the guards 
of functions that use these operations.  We have separated these "type 
lemmas" from the large body of other lemmas in <a href="ACL2____LOGOPS-LEMMAS.html">logops-lemmas</a> to allow a 
user to use this book to define guard-verified functions without having to also 
include the extensive theory in <span class="v">logops-lemmas</span>.</p> 
 
<p>The standard Common Lisp logical operations on numbers are defined on the 
signed integers, and return signed integers as appropriate.  This allows a high 
level, signed interpretation of hardware operations if that is appropriate for 
the specification at hand.  We also provide unsigned versions of several of the 
standard logical operations for use in specifications where fixed-length 
unsigned integers are used to model hardware registers and busses.  This view 
of hardware is used, for example, in Yuan Yu's Nqthm specification of the 
Motorola MC68020.</p>
