<p>ACL2 Version  2.7 (November, 2002) Notes</p><p>The Version_2.7 notes are divided into the subtopics below.  Here 
 we give only a brief summary of a few of the changes that seem most likely to 
 impact existing proofs.  Not included in this brief summary, but included in 
 the subtopics, are descriptions of improvements (including bug fixes and new 
 functionality) that should not get in the way of existing proof efforts.</p> 
 
 <p>In particular, please see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-7-new-functionality</a> for discussion 
 of a number of new features that you may find useful.</p> 
 
 <p>Acknowledgements and elaboration, as well as other changes, can be found in 
 the subtopics listed below.</p> 
 
 <h5>Bug fixes (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-BUG-FIXES.html">note-2-7-bug-fixes</a>)</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Three soundness bugs were fixed.  These bugs were probably rarely hit, so 
 users may well not notice these changes.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></span> now requires <span class="v">:skip-proofs-ok t</span> (respectively, 
 <span class="v">:defaxioms-okp t</span>) if there are <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> (respectively, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>) events in the book or any included sub-books.</li> 
 
 <li>When <span class="v">:by</span> hints refer to a definition, they now use the original body 
 of that definition rather than the simplified (``normalized'') body.</li> 
 
 <li>When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> is applied to a stringp file name, it now temporarily 
 sets the connected book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>) to the directory of that 
 file while evaluating forms in that file.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h5>New functionality (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-7-new-functionality</a>)</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>ACL2 now works harder to apply <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rules with free variables in the hypotheses.  See <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-7-new-functionality</a>, in particular its first two paragraphs, for 
 details.  <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">Forward-chaining</a> also does more with free 
 variables.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h5>Changes in proof engine (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-PROOFS.html">note-2-7-proofs</a>)</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Some prover heuristics have changed slightly.  Among other consequences, 
 this can cause subgoal <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> to change.  For example, suppose that the 
 Version_2.6 proof of a particular theorem generated "Subgoal 2" and 
 "Subgoal 1" while Version_2.7 only generates the second of these.  Then a 
 subgoal hint attached to "Subgoal 1" in Version_2.6 would have to be 
 attached to "Goal'" in Version_2.7.  (See <a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a>.)  The full topic 
 has details (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-PROOFS.html">note-2-7-proofs</a>).</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h5>Changes in rules and definitions (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-RULES.html">note-2-7-rules</a>)</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The package name of a generated variable has changed for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h5>Guard-related changes (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-GUARDS.html">note-2-7-guards</a>)</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">Guard</a></span> verification formerly succeeded in a few cases where it 
 should have failed.</li> 
 
 <li>Guards generated from type declarations now use functions 
 <span class="v">signed-byte-p</span> and <span class="v">unsigned-byte-p</span>, now defined in source file 
 <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span> and formerly defined rather similarly under 
 <span class="v">books/ihs/</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h5>proof-builder changes (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-PROOF-BUILDER.html">note-2-7-proof-builder</a>)</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>See the above doc topic.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h5>System-level changes (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-SYSTEM.html">note-2-7-system</a>)</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>See the above doc topic.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h5>Other changes (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-OTHER.html">note-2-7-other</a>)</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>A new <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INVISIBLE-FNS-TABLE.html">invisible-fns-table</a></span>, takes the place of the 
 handling of invisible functions in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>,</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></span> event has been modified so that the default 
 action is an error rather than a warning.</li> 
 
 <li>Proof output that reports destructor elimination no longer uses the word 
 ``generalizing''.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Again, please proceed to the subtopics for more thorough release 
 notes.</p>
