<p>Modify the verbosity of <span class="v">TTAG NOTE</span> printing</p><pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEFERRED-TTAG-NOTES.html">set-deferred-ttag-notes</a> val state)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">val</span> is <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> for a discussion of trust tags (ttags).  By default, a 
 ``<span class="v">TTAG NOTE</span>'' is printed in order to indicate reliance on a ttag.  When 
 many such notes are printed, it may be desirable to avoid seeing them all. 
 Upon evaluation of the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEFERRED-TTAG-NOTES.html">set-deferred-ttag-notes</a> t state)</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 will enter a deferred mode for the printing of ttag notes.  In this 
 mode, only the first ttag note is printed for each top-level command, and the 
 remainder are summarized before the next top-level prompt (if any) is printed, 
 hence before the next command is evaluated.  That summary is merely a list of 
 ttags, but the summary explains that the full ttag notes may be printed with 
 the command <span class="v">(show-ttag-notes)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">(show-ttag-notes)</span> spares you duplicate ttag notes.  If you 
 want to see every ttag note as it would normally appear, for maximum security, 
 do not evaluate the command <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEFERRED-TTAG-NOTES.html">set-deferred-ttag-notes</a> t state)</span>.  You can 
 undo the effect of this command, returning to an immediate mode for printing 
 ttag notes, by evaluating:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEFERRED-TTAG-NOTES.html">set-deferred-ttag-notes</a> nil state)</pre>
