<p>Paths in key trees.</p><p>As explained in [BIP32], 
     the derivation of child keys from parent keys give rise to key trees. 
     Each key in a tree is designated by 
     a list of zero or more unsigned 32-bit bytes, 
     each of which is a key index <span class="v">i</span> 
     as used in the child key derivation functions; 
     the empty path designates the root of the tree.</p><p>This kind of path corresponds to the notation 
     \mathsf{a/b/c} used in [BIP32]. 
     However, we do not use any explicit \mathsf{H} subscripts 
     to denote indices of hardened keys; 
     we simply use indices whose most significant bit is set, 
     e.g. 3_\mathsf{H} is index 2^{31}+3.</p><p>Below we lift the key derivation functions from single indices to paths. 
     These key derivation functions on paths designate keys in a tree, 
     starting with a root. 
     All the derivations in the path must be valid (i.e. return no error) 
     in order for a path to designate a valid key; 
     otherwise, as stated in [BIP32], the corresponding key is skipped.</p><p>In our formalization of BIP 32, 
     we use the library type <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE32-LIST.html">ubyte32-list</a></span> for paths.</p>
