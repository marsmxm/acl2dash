 <p>We begin this documentation with an introduction, focusing on the example

 clause-processor rules.  You might find it most useful simply to look at the 
 examples in community books directory <span class="v">books/clause-processors/</span>; see file 
 <span class="v">Readme.lsp</span> in that directory.</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____DEFINE-TRUSTED-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">define-trusted-clause-processor</a> for documentation of an 
 analogous utility that does not require the clause-processor to be proved 
 correct.  But please read the present documentation before reading about that 
 utility.  Both utilities designate functions as ``clause-processors''.  Such 
 functions must be executable — hence not constrained by virtue of being 
 introduced in the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> — and must 
 respect <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> and output arity restrictions.  For example, something 
 like <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> ...))</span> is illegal; also see <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>.</p> 
 
 <h4>INTRODUCTION</h4> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rule installs a simplifier at the level of goals, 
 where a goal is represented as a <i>clause</i>: a list of <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>s that is 
 implicitly viewed as a disjunction (the application of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a></span>).  For 
 example, if ACL2 prints a goal in the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> p q) r)</span>, then 
 the clause might be the one-element list containing the internal 
 representation of this term — <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> p q 'nil) r)</span> — but 
 more likely, the corresponding clause is <span class="v">((<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> p) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> q) r)</span>.  Note that 
 the members of a clause are <i>translated</i> terms; see <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a></span>.  For example, they do not contain calls of the macro <span class="v">AND</span>, 
 and constants are quoted.  The result of running a clause-processor must be a 
 list of legal clauses; see <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> for a discussion of translated terms, 
 and for related discussion about ``forbidden'' function symbols, <a href="ACL2____SET-SKIP-META-TERMP-CHECKS.html">set-skip-meta-termp-checks</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The recognizer for a clause is the function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERM-LISTP.html">term-listp</a></span> and the 
 recognizer for a list of clauses is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERM-LIST-LISTP.html">term-list-listp</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that clause-processor simplifiers are similar to metafunctions, and 
 similar efficiency considerations apply.  See <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>, in particular the 
 discussion on how to ``make a metafunction maximally efficient.''</p> 
 
 <p>Unlike rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span>, rules of class 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> must be applied by explicit <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> 
 <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>; they are not applied automatically (unless by way of computed 
 hints; see <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>).  But <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rules can be 
 useful in situations for which it is more convenient to code a simplifier that 
 manipulates the entire goal clause rather than individual subterms of terms in 
 the clause.</p> 
 
 <p>We begin with a simple illustrative example: a clause-processor that 
 assumes an alleged fact (named <span class="v">term</span> in the example) and creates a 
 separate goal to prove that fact.  We can extend the hypotheses of the current 
 goal (named <span class="v">cl</span> in the example) with a term by adding the negation of that 
 term to the clause (disjunctive) representation of that goal.  So the 
 following returns a list of two clauses: the result of adding <span class="v">term</span> as a 
 hypothesis to the input clause, as just described, and a second clause 
 consisting only of that term.  This list of two clauses can be viewed as the 
 conjunction of the first clause and the second clause (where again, each 
 clause is viewed as a disjunction).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> note-fact-clause-processor (cl term)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) ; optional, for better efficiency
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'not term)
              cl)
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> term)))</pre> 
 
 <p>As with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> rules, we need to introduce a suitable 
 evaluator; see <a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a> if you want details.  Since we expect to 
 reason about the function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a></span>, because of its role in 
 <span class="v">note-fact-clause-processor</span> as defined above, we include <span class="v">NOT</span> in the 
 set of functions known to this evaluator.  We also include <span class="v">IF</span>, as is 
 often a good idea.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a> evl0 evl0-list
  ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> x y z)))</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 can now prove the following theorem automatically.  (This is the 
 example displayed at the outset of this <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic.)  Of 
 course, <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rules about clause-processor functions less 
 trivial than <span class="v">note-fact-clause-processor</span> may require lemmas to be proved 
 first!  The function <span class="v">disjoin</span> takes a clause and returns its disjunction 
 (the result of applying <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a></span> to its members), and <span class="v">conjoin-clauses</span> 
 applies <span class="v">disjoin</span> to every element of a given list of clauses and then 
 conjoins (applies <span class="v">AND</span>) to the corresponding list of resulting terms.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> correctness-of-note-fact-clause-processor
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-LISTP.html">pseudo-term-listp</a> cl)
                (<a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a> a)
                (evl0 (conjoin-clauses
                       (note-fact-clause-processor cl term))
                      a))
           (evl0 (<a href="ACL2____DISJOIN.html">disjoin</a> cl) a))
  :rule-classes :clause-processor)</pre> 
 
 <p>Now let us submit a silly but illustrative example theorem to ACL2, to show 
 how a corresponding <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> hint is applied.  The hint says to 
 apply the clause-processor function, <span class="v">note-fact-clause-processor</span>, to the 
 current goal clause and a ``user hint'' as the second argument of that 
 function, in this case <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> a a)</span>.  Thus, a specific variable, 
 <span class="v">clause</span>, is always bound to the current goal clause for the evaluation of 
 the <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> hint, to produce a list of clauses.  Since two 
 subgoals are created below, we know that this list contained two clauses. 
 Indeed, these are the clauses returned when <span class="v">note-fact-clause-processor</span> is 
 applied to two arguments: the current clause, which is the one-element list 
 <span class="v">((<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x y)) x))</span>, and the user hint, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> a a)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x y))
                   x)
            :hints
            (("Goal"
              :clause-processor
              (note-fact-clause-processor clause '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> a a)))))

[Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing of the goal above.
Thanks!]

We now apply the verified :CLAUSE-PROCESSOR function NOTE-FACT-CLAUSE-
PROCESSOR to produce two new subgoals.

Subgoal 2
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> A A)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> X Y)) X)).

But we reduce the conjecture to T, by the :executable-counterpart of
IF and the simple :rewrite rule CAR-CONS.

Subgoal 1
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> A A).

But we reduce the conjecture to T, by primitive type reasoning.

 <p>That concludes our introduction to clause-processor rules and hints.  We 
 turn now to detailed documentation.</p> 
 
 <h4>DETAILED DOCUMENTATION</h4> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of a clause-processor function, <span class="v">CL-PROC</span>, must 
 have one of the following forms.  Here, each <span class="v">st_i</span> is a <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> 
 (possibly <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>) while the other parameters and results are not stobjs 
 (see <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>).  Note that there need not be input stobjs in [3] — 
 i.e., <span class="v">k</span> can be 0 — and even if there are, there need not be output 
 stobjs.  In most ways [3] and [3+] are treated similarly; see <a href="ACL2____MAKE-SUMMARY-DATA.html">make-summary-data</a> for a discussion of the form of <span class="v">d</span> in [3+] and, more 
 generally, for how [3+] differs from [3] by enhancing the <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">[1]  ((CL-PROC cl) =&gt; cl-list)

[2]  ((CL-PROC cl hint) =&gt; cl-list)

[3]  ((CL-PROC cl hint st_1 ... st_k) =&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp cl-list st_i1 ... st_in))

[3+] ((CL-PROC cl hint st_1 ... st_k) =&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp cl-list st_i1 ... st_in d))</pre> 
 
 <p>We call <span class="v">cl-list</span> the <i>clauses-result</i>.  In [3] and [3+], we think 
 of the first component of the result as an error flag.  Indeed, a proof will 
 instantly abort if that error flag is not <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We next discuss the legal forms of <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rules, followed 
 below by a discussion of <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  In the 
 discussion below, we use lower-case names to represent specific symbols, for 
 example <span class="v">implies</span>, and also to represent <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> names; and we use 
 upper-case names to represent arbitrary pieces of syntax (which we will 
 describe), for example, <span class="v">CL</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> specification includes 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor</span>, then the corresponding term must have the following 
 form.  (Additional ``meta-extract'' hypotheses, not shown or discussed below, 
 may be included as desired in order to use facts from the logical <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a></span> to help prove the rule; see <a href="ACL2____META-EXTRACT.html">meta-extract</a> for explanation of this 
 advanced feature.)</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; General Form (omitting possible meta-extract hypotheses)
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-LISTP.html">pseudo-term-listp</a> CL)
              (<a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a> A)
              (EVL (conjoin-clauses &lt;CL-LIST&gt;)
                    B))
         (EVL (<a href="ACL2____DISJOIN.html">disjoin</a> CL) A))</pre> 
 
 <p>Here <span class="v">EVL</span> is a known evaluator; <span class="v">CL</span> and <span class="v">A</span> are distinct 
 non-stobj variables; and <span class="v">&lt;CL-LIST&gt;</span> is an expression representing the 
 clauses returned by the clause-processor function <span class="v">CL-PROC</span>, whose form 
 depends on the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of that function, as follows.  Typically 
 <span class="v">B</span> is <span class="v">A</span>, but it can be any term (useful when generalization is 
 occurring; see the example ``Test generalizing alist'' in community book 
 <span class="v">books/clause-processors/basic-examples.lisp</span>).  For cases [1] and [2] 
 above, <span class="v">&lt;CL-LIST&gt;</span> is of the form <span class="v">(CL-PROC CL)</span> or <span class="v">(CL-PROC CL
 HINT)</span>, respectively, where in the latter case <span class="v">HINT</span> is a non-stobj 
 variable distinct from the variables <span class="v">CL</span> and <span class="v">A</span>.  For cases [3] and 
 [3+], <span class="v">&lt;CL-LIST&gt;</span> is the result of wrapping the function 
 <span class="v">clauses-result</span> around a call of <span class="v">CL-PROC</span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(clauses-result (CL-PROC CL HINT ...))</pre> 
 
 <p>Logically, <span class="v">clauses-result</span> returns the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CADR.html">cadr</a></span> if the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span> 
 is <span class="v">NIL</span>, and otherwise (for the error case) returns a list containing the 
 empty (false) clause.  So in the non-error case, <span class="v">clauses-result</span> picks out 
 the second result, denoted <span class="v">cl-list</span> in [3] and [3+] above, and in the 
 error case the implication above trivially holds.</p> 
 
 <p>In the above theorem, we are asked to prove <span class="v">(EVL (<a href="ACL2____DISJOIN.html">disjoin</a> CL) A)</span> 
 assuming that the conjunction of all clauses produced by the clause processor 
 evaluates to a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value under some alist <span class="v">B</span>.  In fact, we can 
 choose <span class="v">B</span> so as to allow us to assume evaluations of the generated clauses 
 over many different alists.  This technique is discussed in the community book 
 <span class="v">books/clause-processors/multi-env-trick.lisp</span>, which introduces some 
 macros that may be helpful in accomplishing proofs of this type.</p> 
 
 <p>The clause-processor function, <span class="v">CL</span>, must have a guard that ACL2 can 
 trivially prove from the hypotheses that the first argument of <span class="v">CL</span> is 
 known to be a <span class="v">pseudo-term-listp</span> and any <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> arguments are 
 assumed to satisfy their stobj predicates.</p> 
 
 <p>Next we specify the legal forms for <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>. 
 The basic form is <span class="v">:clause-processor TERM</span>, such that the translation of 
 <span class="v">TERM</span> to a legal ACL2 term yields a call of a clause-processor function 
 <span class="v">(CL-PROC clause)</span> or <span class="v">(CL-PROC clause HINT ...)</span>, where <span class="v">HINT</span> is a 
 term whose only non-stobj free variable (if any) is the symbol, <span class="v">clause</span>. 
 Note that the first argument of the call is literally the variable, 
 <span class="v">clause</span>.  Recall that at the time the :clause-processor hint is applied to 
 the clausal form <span class="v">CL</span> of the current subgoal, <span class="v">clause</span> is bound to 
 <span class="v">CL</span>; moreover, any stobj names will be bound to the corresponding 
 stobjs.</p> 
 
 <p>But there are two additional general forms for <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> 
 hints, which may viewed as abbreviations for the basic form discussed above. 
 The first additional general form, which we call the ``<span class="v">:function</span> form'', 
 includes the following two classes of expressions.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:clause-processor (:function F)
:clause-processor (:function F :hint HINT)</pre> 
 
 <p>The first of these <span class="v">:function</span> forms abbreviates the following hint, 
 where either <span class="v">F</span> is a macro-alias for the function symbol <span class="v">CL-PROC</span> (see 
 <a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a>), and otherwise <span class="v">CL-PROC</span> is just the function 
 symbol <span class="v">F</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:clause-processor (CL-PROC clause)</pre> 
 
 <p>Similarly the second of the <span class="v">:function</span> forms above abbreviates the 
 following, where <span class="v">CL-PROC</span> is as above and the output signature of 
 <span class="v">CL-PROC</span> is <span class="v">(nil nil st_1 ... st_k)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:clause-processor (CL-PROC clause HINT st_1 ... st_k)</pre> 
 
 <p>Besides the ``<span class="v">:function</span> form'', there is one more additional general 
 form for <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> hint: a symbol, as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:clause-processor F</pre> 
 
 <p>This expands to a basic form as follows, depending on <span class="v">F</span>.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>If <span class="v">F</span> is a macro with one required argument or a function symbol with 
 one argument:<br> 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor (F clause)</span>
</li> 
 
 <li>If <span class="v">F</span> is a macro with two required arguments or a function symbol with 
 two arguments:<br> 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor (F clause nil)</span>
</li> 
 
 <li>If <span class="v">F</span> is a function symbol with inputs of the form [3] or [3+] above, 
 that is, with input signature <span class="v">(nil nil st_1 ... st_k)</span>:<br> 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor (F clause nil st_1 ... st_k)</span>
</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>For examples of these syntactic forms, see community book 
 <span class="v">books/clause-processors/basic-examples.lisp</span>).  We turn now to discussion 
 of when a <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> hint causes an abort.</p> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> hint causes the proof to abort if the 
 clauses-result is not a list of clauses, i.e., a list of (translated) <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> lists in the current logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  This test is done explicitly 
 every time a clause processor is run unless a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WELL-FORMEDNESS-GUARANTEE.html">well-formedness-guarantee</a></span> has been provided with the <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> 
 rule or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-SKIP-META-TERMP-CHECKS.html">set-skip-meta-termp-checks</a></span> has been used with an active trust 
 tag to skip the check at the user's risk.</p> 
 
 <p>The proof also aborts when the clause-processor function returns at least 
 two values and the first value returned — the ``<span class="v">erp</span>'' value from 
 cases [3] and [3+] above — is not <span class="v">nil</span>.  In that case, <span class="v">erp</span> is 
 used for printing an error message as follows: if it is a string, then that 
 string is printed; but if it is a non-empty true list whose first element is a 
 string, then it is printed as though by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a> ~@0 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\0 erp))
 ...)</span> (see <a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a>).  Otherwise, a non-<span class="v">nil</span> <span class="v">erp</span> value causes a 
 generic error message to be printed.</p> 
 
 <p>If there is no error as above, but the <span class="v">CL-PROC</span> call returns a clause 
 list whose single element is equal to the input clause, then the hint is 
 ignored since we are left with the goal with which we started.  In that case, 
 the other prover processes are then applied as usual (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS-AND-THE-WATERFALL.html">hints-and-the-waterfall</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>You can see all current <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rules by issuing the 
 following command: <span class="v">(print-clause-processor-rules)</span>.</p>
