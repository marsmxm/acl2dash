<p>Implementation of <span class="tt"><a href="APT____ISODATA.html">isodata</a></span>.</p><p>The implementation functions have arguments, 
                        as well as results (in the <a href="STD____RETURNS-SPECIFIERS.html"><span class="v">:returns</span> specifiers</a>), consistently named as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="v">state</span> is the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">wrld</span> is the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">ctx</span> is the <a href="ACL2____CTX.html">context</a> used for errors.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">old</span>, 
   <span class="v">isomaps</span>, 
   <span class="v">predicate</span>, 
   <span class="v">new-name</span>, 
   <span class="v">new-enable</span>, 
   <span class="v">old-to-new-name</span>, 
   <span class="v">old-to-new-enable</span>, 
   <span class="v">new-to-old-name</span>, 
   <span class="v">new-to-old-enable</span>, 
   <span class="v">newp-of-new-name</span>, 
   <span class="v">newp-of-new-enable</span>, 
   <span class="v">verify-guards</span>, 
   <span class="v">untranslate</span>, 
   <span class="v">hints</span>, 
   <span class="v">print</span>, and 
   <span class="v">show-only</span> 
   are the homonymous inputs to <span class="tt"><a href="APT____ISODATA.html">isodata</a></span>, 
   before being validated. 
   These formal parameters have no types because they may be any values.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">old$</span>, 
   <span class="v">predicate$</span>, 
   <span class="v">new-enable$</span>, 
   <span class="v">old-to-new-enable$</span>, 
   <span class="v">new-to-old-enable$</span>, 
   <span class="v">newp-of-new-enable$</span>, 
   <span class="v">verify-guards$</span>, 
   <span class="v">untranslate$</span>, 
   <span class="v">hints$</span>, 
   <span class="v">print$</span>, and 
   <span class="v">show-only$</span> 
   are the result of processing 
   the homonymous inputs (without the <span class="v">$</span>). 
   Some are identical to the corresponding inputs, 
   but they have types implied by their successful validation, 
   performed when they are processed.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">new$</span> is the result of processing <span class="v">new-name</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">old-to-new$</span> is the result of processing <span class="v">old-to-new-name</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">new-to-old$</span> is the result of processing <span class="v">new-to-old-name</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">newp-of-new$</span> is the result of processing <span class="v">newp-of-new-name</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">m</span> is the number of results of <span class="v">old</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">arg-isomaps</span> is an alist 
   from formal arguments of <span class="v">old</span> 
   to isomorphic mapping records that specify 
   how the associated formal arguments must be transformed. 
   There are never duplicate keys. 
   When input processing is complete, 
   the keys are exactly all the formal arguments of <span class="v">old</span>, in order. 
   <span class="v">arg-isomaps</span> results from processing <span class="v">isomaps</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">res-isomaps</span> is an alist 
   from positive integers from 1 to <span class="v">m</span> 
   to isomorphic mapping records that specify 
   how the result with the associated (1-based) indices 
   must be transformed. 
   There are never duplicate keys. 
   When input processing is complete: 
   if some results are transformed, 
   the keys are exactly all the integers from 1 to <span class="v">m</span>, in order; 
   if no results are transformed, 
   the alist is <span class="v">nil</span>. 
   <span class="v">res-isomaps</span> results from processing <span class="v">isomaps</span>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">appcond-thm-names</span> is an alist 
   from the applicability condition keywords 
   to the corresponding theorem names.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">old-fn-unnorm-name</span> is the name of the theorem 
   that installs the non-normalized definition of the old function.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">new-fn-unnorm-name</span> is the name of the theorem 
   that installs the non-normalized definition of the new function.</li>
</ul><p>Implementation functions' arguments and results 
                        that are not listed above 
                        are described in, or clear from, 
                        those functions' documentation.</p>
