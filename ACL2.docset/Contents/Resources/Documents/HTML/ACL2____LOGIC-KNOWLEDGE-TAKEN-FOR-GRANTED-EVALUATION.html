<p>Evaluation during proofs</p><p>Any time you are proving a formula and see a subterm in the formula 
 that contains no variables, you can just evaluate the subterm.</p> 
 
 <p>This is familiar from algebra: It is not uncommon to rearrange a 
 polynomial to collect all the constants and then add them up:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(3x + 2 + 7y + 2)
=
(3x + 7y + (2 + 2))
=
(3x + 7y + 4).</pre> 
 
 <p>That last step is just evaluation.</p> 
 
 <p>It happens often in ACL2 proofs because theorems involve constants and 
 defined functions and when those constants ``drift into the maw'' of a 
 function, the function call can be eliminated and replaced by a new constant. 
 ACL2 does this automatically; you don't have to tell it.  In fact, there are a 
 few occasions where you might prefer it <i>not</i> evaluate and those are the 
 ones you have to look out for!  They'll be obvious when they happen because 
 you'll see a mysterious constant crop up in the proof.</p> 
 
 <p>Evaluation is legal because it is just the repeated use of unconditional 
 rewriting to replace definitions by their instantiated bodies until no 
 function calls remain.</p>
