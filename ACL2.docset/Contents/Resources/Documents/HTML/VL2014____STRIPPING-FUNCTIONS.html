<p>Functions for throwing away attributes, widths, etc., so that 
expressions and module elements can be compared using <a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a>.</p><p>In many basic kinds of <a href="VL2014____LINT.html">lint</a>ing and well-formedness checking, 
it is useful to be able to compare module elements using <span class="v">equal</span>.  But 
<span class="v">equal</span> can report that elements are different because of, e.g., their 
location information, widths and other annotations on expressions, and other 
kinds of semantically irrelevant attributes.</p> 
 
<p>These <b>stripping</b> functions attempt to strip away these kind of 
semantically irrelevant components of module elements, so that they can be 
compared with <span class="v">equal</span>.  For instance, we replace all locations with <a href="VL2014_____A2VL-FAKELOC_A2.html">*vl-fakeloc*</a>, replace all attributes with <span class="v">nil</span>, etc.</p> 
 
<p>Exactly what we throw away depends on the kind of module element.  In some 
cases this may not be exactly what you want.  See the individual functions for 
details.</p>
