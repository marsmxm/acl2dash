<p>Functions for joining strings together.</p><p><b><font color="#ff0000">Efficiency Warning</font></b>. 
Concatenating strings in ACL2 is fundamentally slow.  Why?  In Common Lisp, 
strings are just arrays of characters, and there is not any mechanism for 
efficiently splicing together arrays.  Any kind of string concatenation, then, 
minimally requires creating a completely new array and copying all of the input 
characters into it.  This makes it especially slow to repeatedly use, e.g., 
<a href="STR____CAT.html">cat</a> to build up a string.</p> 
 
<p>To build strings more efficiently, a good general strategy is to build up a 
reverse-order character list, and then convert it into a string at the end. 
See for instance the functions <a href="STR____REVAPPEND-CHARS.html">revappend-chars</a> and <a href="STR____RCHARS-TO-STRING.html">rchars-to-string</a>, which make this rather easy to do.</p>
