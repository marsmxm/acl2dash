<p>How to use <span class="v">depends-on</span> to tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> about additional, 
non-Lisp files that your books depend on.</p><p>Some ACL2 books load extra files in unusual ways.  For 
instance,</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>An ACL2 book for verifying a Java program might use <a href="ACL2____IO.html">ACL2::io</a> 
routines to load <span class="v">encrypt.java</span>, or</li> 
 
<li>An ACL2 book with trust tags might use <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-RAW.html">ACL2::include-raw</a> to load in 
some extra raw Lisp file named <span class="v">server-raw.lsp</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>In either case, since these extra files are not being loaded using <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will not automatically know that these book depend 
on <span class="v">encrypt.java</span> and <span class="v">server-raw.lsp</span>.</p> 
 
<p>To tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> about additional dependencies, you may put a special 
<span class="v">depends-on</span> comment in your book.  For the Java program we might write 
something like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">; (depends-on "encrypt.java")
(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a> (*java-file* state)
  (read-java-program "encrypt.java"))</pre> 
 
<p>Whereas for the server, you could write, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">; (depends-on "server-raw.lsp")
(include-raw "server-raw.lsp")</pre> 
 
<p>This dependency mechanism is good enough to handle situations where you are 
directly reading in these source or data files.  However, it is <b>not</b> 
general enough to handle the situations where the file you are reading needs to 
be rebuilt.</p> 
 
<p>For instance, suppose that our Java book doesn't verify a source code file 
like <span class="v">encrypt.java</span>, but instead verifies the output of the Java compiler, 
i.e., <span class="v">encrypt.class</span>.  Normally we would need to build <span class="v">encrypt.class</span> 
whenever <span class="v">encrypt.java</span> is updated, by running a command like</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ javac encrypt.java</pre> 
 
<p>We can still use a <span class="v">depends-on</span> comment to tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> that our 
ACL2 book depends on <span class="v">encrypt.class</span>, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">; (depends-on "encrypt.class")
(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a> (*class-file* state)
  (read-java-class-file "encrypt.class"))</pre> 
 
<p>This is better than nothing.  <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will at least know it needs to 
recertify our ACL2 book if the <span class="v">.class</span> file changes.  However, there's no 
way to tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> that this <span class="v">.class</span> file also depends on 
<span class="v">encrypt.java</span>, so editing <span class="v">encrypt.java</span> won't be enough to trigger a 
recertification.</p> 
 
<p>When your project gets to this point—needing a build system that can 
deal with both ACL2 books and other kinds of files—you have exceeded the 
ability of <span class="v">cert.pl</span> as a purely standalone tool.  It now becomes a tool 
to help you write a Makefile for your whole project.</p>
