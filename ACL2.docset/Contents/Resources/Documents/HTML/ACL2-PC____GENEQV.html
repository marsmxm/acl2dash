<p>(macro) 
show the generated equivalence relation maintained at the current subterm</p><pre class="code">General Forms:
geneqv     ; show list of equivalence relations being maintained
(geneqv t) ; as above, but pair each relation with a justifying rune</pre> 
 
 <p>This is an advanced command, whose effect is to print the so-called 
 ``generated equivalence relation'' (or ``geneqv'') that is maintained at the 
 current subterm of the conclusion.  That structure is a list of equivalence 
 relations, representing the transitive closure <span class="v">E</span> of the union of those 
 relations, such that it suffices to maintain <span class="v">E</span> at the current subterm: if 
 that subterm, <span class="v">u</span>, is replaced in the goal's conclusion, <span class="v">G</span>, by another 
 term equivalent to <span class="v">u</span> with respect to <span class="v">E</span>, then the resulting 
 conclusion is Boolean equivalent to <span class="v">G</span>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The command `<span class="v">geneqv</span>' prints the above list of equivalence relations, 
 or more precisely, the list of function symbols for those relations.  If 
 however <span class="v">geneqv</span> is given a non-<span class="v">nil</span> argument, then a list is printed 
 whose elements are each of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> r)</span>, where <span class="v">s</span> is the symbol for 
 an equivalence relation and <span class="v">r</span> is a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a></span> <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> 
 justifying the inclusion of <span class="v">s</span> in the list of equivalence relations being 
 maintained at the current subterm.</p>
