<p>Sparse bitsets library: an alternative to <a href="ACL2____BITSETS.html">bitsets</a> for 
representing finite sets of natural numbers.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>In the ordinary <a href="ACL2____BITSETS.html">bitsets</a> library, sets of natural numbers are encoded 
as bignums.  This is perfectly fine when the set elements are relatively small, 
but it is not an efficient way to deal with sets of large numbers.  For 
instance, trying to insert a number like 2^30 into an ordinary bitset will 
probably kill your Lisp.</p> 
 
<p>Sparse bitsets are a more forgiving alternative.  They can handle very large 
set elements, but still achieve bitset-like efficiencies in many cases.</p> 
 
<p>Sparse bitsets are represented as ordered lists of <span class="v">(offset . block)</span> 
pairs.  Loosely speaking, each such pair in the set <span class="v">X</span> means that:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">offset*blocksize + 0             \in X  iff  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> 0 block)
offset*blocksize + 1             \in X  iff  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> 1 block)
  ...
offset*blocksize + (blocksize-1) \in X  iff  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> (blocksize-1) block)</pre> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">blocksize</span> is a some constant determined by <a href="BITSETS_____A2SBITSET-BLOCK-SIZE_A2.html">*sbitset-block-size*</a>.  We'll assume it is 60 (which makes each <span class="v">block</span> a 
fixnum on 64-bit CCL).</p> 
 
<h4>Efficiency Considerations</h4> 
 
<p>Sparse bitsets are essentially a hybrid of ordered sets and bitsets, and 
their efficiency characteristics are very data dependent.</p> 
 
<p>Sparse bitsets perform best on sets that have "clusters" of nearby 
members, perhaps separated by wide gaps.  Here, sparse bitsets give you some of 
the same benefits of bitsets, viz. word-at-a-time operations like union and the 
space efficiency of using bit masks to represent the set members.</p> 
 
<p>For completely dense sets, e.g., all integers in <span class="v">[0, 1000]</span>, sparse 
bitsets are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Better than ordered sets, because they get to compress nearby elements into 
 bitmasks and use word-at-a-time operations.</li> 
 
<li>Somewhat worse than ordinary bitsets.  They are less space efficient due to 
 the conses and offset numbers.  They are also more expensive for membership 
 testing: regular bitsets can basically use O(1) array indexing via <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a>, while sparse bitsets must use an O(n) search for the right 
 pair.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>For "cluster-free" sets where the elements are so far apart that they 
never fall into the same block, sparse bitsets are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Better than bitsets, which perform badly here since they can have large 
segments of 0 bits that waste space and take time to process during set 
operations.</li> 
 
<li>Somewhat worse than ordered sets.  For instance, a set like {0, 60, 120} 
would be encoded as <span class="v">((0 . 1) (1 . 1) (2 . 1))</span>, which is similar to its 
ordered set representation except for the additional overhead of using <span class="v">(1
. 1)</span> to represent 60, etc.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h3>Sparse Bitset Operations</h3> 
 
<p>Convention:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">a, b, ...</span> denote set elements</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">X, Y, ...</span> denote sets.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Valid sparse bitsets are recognized by <a href="ACL2____SBITSETP.html">sbitsetp</a>, and there is a 
standard fixing function, <a href="ACL2____SBITSET-FIX.html">sbitset-fix</a>.</p> 
 
<p>We intend to eventually implement sparse analogues for all of the functions 
in the <a href="ACL2____BITSETS.html">bitsets</a> library, and analogues for the bitset <a href="BITSETS____REASONING.html">reasoning</a> 
techniques.  For now we have only finished a few of these operations:</p>
