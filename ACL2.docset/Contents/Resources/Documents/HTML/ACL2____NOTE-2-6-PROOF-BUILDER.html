<p>ACL2 Version  2.6 Notes on proof-builder Changes</p><p>The proof-builder command <span class="v">=</span>, when used with no arguments, now 
 reports which hypothesis is being used.</p> 
 
 <p>The output from <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command <span class="v">type-alist</span> has been 
 improved.</p> 
 
 <p>A slight change has been made to the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> for commands 
 <span class="v">promote</span>, <span class="v">casesplit</span>, <span class="v">equiv</span>, and <span class="v">=</span>, so that terms of the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> x nil y)</span> are recognized as conjunctions, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> x) y)</span>. 
 Thanks to Pete Manolios for suggesting that we consider such a change.</p> 
 
 <p>There is a new <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command <span class="v">print-all-concs</span> that 
 prints all the conclusions of the unproved goals.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a></span> command, <span class="v">runes</span>, has been added.  It 
 reports the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s that have participated in the interactive proof up to 
 the current point.</p>
