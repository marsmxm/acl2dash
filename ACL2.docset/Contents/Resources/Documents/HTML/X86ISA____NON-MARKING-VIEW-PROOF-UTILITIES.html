<p>General-purpose code-proof libraries to include in the 
  system-level non-marking view (with A/D flag updates off)</p><p>When reasoning about an supervisor-mode program in the 
  system-level <i>non-marking</i> view of the x86 ISA model, include 
  the book <span class="v">x86isa/proofs/utilities/sys-view/non-marking-view-top</span> 
  to make use of some standard rules you would need to control the 
  symbolic simulation of the program.</p> 
 
  <p>If unwinding the <span class="v">(<a href="X86ISA____X86-RUN.html">x86-run</a> ... x86)</span> expression during your 
  proof attempt does not result in a 'clean' expression (i.e., one 
  entirely in terms of updates made to the initial state as opposed to 
  in terms of <a href="X86ISA____X86-FETCH-DECODE-EXECUTE.html">x86-fetch-decode-execute</a> or <a href="X86ISA____X86-RUN.html">x86-run</a>), then 
  there is a good chance that you're missing some preconditions, or 
  that the existing rules are not good enough.  In any case, it can 
  help to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the existing rules to figure out what's 
  wrong.  Feel free to send on suggestions for new rules or improving 
  existing ones!</p> 
 
  <p>You can monitor the following rules, depending on the kind of 
  subgoals you see, to get some clues.  You can find definitions of 
  these rules in <a href="X86ISA____UNWIND-X86-INTERPRETER-IN-NON-MARKING-VIEW.html">unwind-x86-interpreter-in-non-marking-view</a>.</p> 
 
  <ul> 
 
    <li>When the subgoal has calls of <span class="v">x86-run</span>: <br> 
        Monitor <span class="v">x86-run-opener-not-ms-not-zp-n</span>. 
   </li> 
 
    <li>When the subgoal has calls of <a href="X86ISA____X86-FETCH-DECODE-EXECUTE.html">x86-fetch-decode-execute</a>: <br> 
        Monitor <span class="v">x86-fetch-decode-execute-opener</span>. 
   </li> 
 
   <li>When monitoring <span class="v">x86-fetch-decode-execute-opener</span> tells you 
    that a hypothesis involving <a href="X86ISA____GET-PREFIXES.html">get-prefixes</a> was not rewritten 
    to <span class="v">t</span>: <br> 
    Monitor 
    <span class="v">get-prefixes-opener-lemma-no-prefix-byte</span> or 
    <span class="v">get-prefixes-opener-lemma-no-legacy-prefix-but-rex-prefix</span>. <br> 
    Note that if the instruction under consideration has prefix 
    bytes, you should monitor one of these rules instead: <br> 
    <span class="v">get-prefixes-opener-lemma-group-1-prefix</span> <br> 
    <span class="v">get-prefixes-opener-lemma-group-2-prefix</span> <br> 
    <span class="v">get-prefixes-opener-lemma-group-3-prefix</span> <br> 
    <span class="v">get-prefixes-opener-lemma-group-4-prefix</span>. 
  </li> 
 
    <li>When monitoring other rules above indicates that an 
    instruction is not being fetched successfully using <a href="X86ISA____RB.html">rb</a>: 
    <br> 
    Monitor <span class="v">one-read-with-rb-from-program-at-in-non-marking-view</span>. 
    </li> 
 
   <li>When monitoring other rules above indicates that ACL2 can't 
    resolve that the program remained unchanged (<a href="X86ISA____PROGRAM-AT.html">program-at</a>) after a write operation <a href="X86ISA____WB.html">wb</a> occurred: <br> 
    Monitor <span class="v">program-at-wb-disjoint-in-non-marking-view</span>. <br> 
    <br> 
    An instance of where monitoring this rule might be helpful is when 
    the <span class="v">program-at</span> hypothesis of 
    <span class="v">one-read-with-rb-from-program-at-in-non-marking-view</span> is not 
    being relieved. 
   </li> 
 
   <li>When inferring the canonical nature of a linear address:<br> 
    Monitor <span class="v">member-p-canonical-address-listp</span>. <br> 
    <br> 
    This is useful if you believe that the canonical nature of a 
    linear address should be inferable from the canonical nature of a 
    list of addresses, of which that address is a member.  An instance 
    of where monitoring this rule 
    might be helpful is when the <span class="v">member-p</span> hypothesis of 
    <span class="v">one-read-with-rb-from-program-at-in-non-marking-view</span> is not 
    being relieved. 
   </li> 
 
   <li>When reasoning about disjointness/overlap of memory regions: <br> 
   <span class="v">rb-wb-disjoint-in-non-marking-view</span> <br> 
   <span class="v">rb-wb-equal-in-non-marking-view</span> <br> 
   <span class="v">la-to-pas-values-and-mv-nth-1-wb-disjoint-from-xlation-gov-addrs-in-non-marking-view</span> <br> 
   <span class="v">all-xlation-governing-entries-paddrs-and-mv-nth-1-wb-disjoint-in-non-marking-view</span> 
   </li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>When symbolically simulating supervisor-mode programs, you might 
 also want to do the following, which replaces ACL2's default ancestor 
 check with something simpler:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(local (include-book "tools/trivial-ancestors-check" :dir :system)) 
(local (acl2::use-trivial-ancestors-check)) 
</pre>
