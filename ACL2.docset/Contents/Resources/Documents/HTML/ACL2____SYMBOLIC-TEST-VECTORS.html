<p>A concise way to describe, evaluate, and debug symbolic simulations 
of E modules.</p><p>A symbolic test vector is a description of a multi-phase <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> simulation.  It lets you say how the state bits should be initialized, 
how the inputs should be set as the simulation proceeds, and when you would 
like the outputs and internal signals to be sampled.</p> 
 
<p>As a user, the main steps for using symbolic test vectors are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Use <a href="ACL2____DEFSTV.html">defstv</a> to introduce the STV you want to run.  You basically 
explain when you want to send into the module, and which outputs you want to 
extract at what times.</li> 
 
<li>Use <a href="ACL2____STV-RUN.html">stv-run</a> to run the STV on some particular inputs.  This is 
intended to be compatible with <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> proofs, and can also be used in a 
stand-alone way to get the outputs of the circuit.</li> 
 
<li>Alternately, use <a href="ACL2____STV-DEBUG.html">stv-debug</a> to run the STV on particular inputs and 
also produce a waveform that can be inspected in a waveform viewer.  This is 
intended for debugging only and cannot be embedded in proofs due to subtle 
memoization issues.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This interface is hopefully sufficient for most users.  But if you want to 
understand more about how we process STVs, you can see <a href="ACL2____STV-IMPLEMENTATION-DETAILS.html">stv-implementation-details</a>.</p>
