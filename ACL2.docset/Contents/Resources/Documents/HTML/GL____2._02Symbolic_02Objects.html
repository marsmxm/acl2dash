<p>At its heart, GL works by manipulating Boolean expressions.  There are 
many ways to represent Boolean expressions.  GL currently supports a hons-based 
<a href="ACL2____UBDDS.html">BDD package</a> and also has support for using a 
hons-based <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">aig</a> representation.</p> 
 
<p>For any particular proof, you can choose which representation to use by 
picking one of the available proof <a href="GL____MODES.html">modes</a>.  Each representation has 
strengths and weaknesses, and the choice of representation can significantly 
impact performance.  We give some advice about choosing these modes in <a href="GL____MODES.html">modes</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The GL user does not need to know how BDDs and AIGs are represented; in this 
documentation we will just adopt a conventional syntax to describe Boolean 
expressions, e.g., <span class="v">true</span>, <span class="v">false</span>, <span class="v">A &amp; B</span>, <span class="v">~C</span>, etc.</p> 
 
<p>GL groups Boolean expressions into <b>symbolic objects</b>.  Much like a 
Boolean expression can be evaluated to obtain a Boolean value, a symbolic 
object can be evaluated to produce an ACL2 object.  There are several kinds of 
symbolic objects, but numbers are a good start.  GL represents symbolic, signed 
integers as</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(:g-integer . &lt;lsb-bits&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>Where <span class="v">lsb-bits</span> is a list of Boolean expressions that represent the 
two's complement bits of the number.  The bits are in lsb-first order, and the 
last, most significant bit is the sign bit.  For instance, if <span class="v">p</span> is the 
following <span class="v">:g-integer</span>,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">p = (:g-integer true   false   A &amp; B   false)</pre> 
 
<p>Then <span class="v">p</span> represents a 4-bit, signed integer whose value is either 1 or 5, 
depending on the value of <span class="v">A &amp; B</span>.</p> 
 
<p>GL uses another kind of symbolic object to represent ACL2 Booleans. 
In particular,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(:g-boolean . &lt;val&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>represents <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>, depending on the Boolean expression 
<span class="v">&lt;val&gt;</span>.  For example,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(:g-boolean . ~(A &amp; B))</pre> 
 
<p>is a symbolic object whose value is <span class="v">t</span> when <span class="v">p</span> has value 1, and 
<span class="v">nil</span> when <span class="v">p</span> has value 5.</p> 
 
<p>GL has a few other kinds of symbolic objects that are also tagged with 
keywords, such as <span class="v">:g-var</span> and <span class="v">:g-apply</span>.  But an ACL2 object 
that does not have any of these special keywords within it is <i>also</i> 
considered to be a symbolic object, and just represents itself.  Furthermore, a 
cons of two symbolic objects represents the cons of the two objects they 
represent.  For instance,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(1 . (:g-boolean .  A &amp; B))</pre> 
 
<p>represents either <span class="v">(1 . t)</span> or <span class="v">(1 . nil)</span>.  Together, these 
conventions allow GL to avoid lots of tagging as symbolic objects are 
manipulated.</p> 
 
<p>One last kind of symbolic object we will mention represents an if-then-else 
among other symbolic objects.  Its syntax is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(:g-ite  &lt;test&gt;  &lt;then&gt;  .  &lt;else&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>where <span class="v">&lt;test&gt;</span>, <span class="v">&lt;then&gt;</span>, and <span class="v">&lt;else&gt;</span> are themselves symbolic 
objects.  The value of a <span class="v">:g-ite</span> is either the value of <span class="v">&lt;then&gt;</span> or 
of <span class="v">&lt;else&gt;</span>, depending on the value of <span class="v">&lt;test&gt;</span>.  For example,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(:g-ite  (:g-boolean . A)
         (:g-integer B  A  false)
         . #\C)</pre> 
 
<p>represents either 2, 3, or the character <span class="v">C</span>.</p> 
 
<p>GL doesn't have a special symbolic object format for ACL2 objects other than 
numbers and Booleans.  But it is still possible to create symbolic objects that 
take any finite range of values among ACL2 objects, by using a nesting of 
<span class="v">:g-ite</span>s where the tests are <span class="v">:g-boolean</span>s.</p>
