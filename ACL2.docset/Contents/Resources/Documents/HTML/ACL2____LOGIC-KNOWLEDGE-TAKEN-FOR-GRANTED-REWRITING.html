<p>A brief explanation of rewriting from the logical perspective</p><p>First we give two examples of rewriting.  Then we give a rather 
 detailed description.  We recommend you read the description, even if you 
 understand the two examples, just so that you learn our terminology.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Example 1</b>: Suppose your goal conjecture is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Goal Conjecture</i>: 
(implies (and (endp z) 
              (true-listp z)) 
         (equal (rev (rev z)) z)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Then you can use the following theorem (actually the definitional axiom 
 introduced by the <span class="v">defun</span> of <span class="v">endp</span>):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Definitional Axiom</i>: endp 
(equal (endp x) 
       (not (consp x))). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>to <i>rewrite</i> the <i>Goal Conjecture</i> to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Rewritten Goal Conjecture</i>: 
(implies (and (not (consp z)) 
              (true-listp z)) 
         (equal (rev (rev z)) z)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that in this example, rewriting replaced the call of <span class="v">endp</span> by its 
 body after instantiating its body with the actuals from the call.  This is 
 sometimes just called <i>expanding</i> the definition of <span class="v">endp</span>.  (The 
 notions of <i>formal</i>, <i>body</i>, <i>call</i>, and <i>actuals</i> are 
 discussed in <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED.html">programming-knowledge-taken-for-granted</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p>Expanding a definition is an example of <i>unconditional</i> rewriting. 
 All definitions in ACL2 are just bare equalities relating a call of the 
 function on its formals to its body.  Any time you use an equality theorem, 
 whether a definitional equality or something more general like</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y) z)
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> y z)))</pre> 
 
 <p>to replace an instance of one side by the corresponding instance of the 
 other in a goal conjecture, we call that <i>unconditional</i> rewriting with 
 the equality.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Example 2</b>: Suppose your goal conjecture is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Goal Conjecture</i>: 
(implies (and (subsetp a b) 
              (true-listp b) 
              (member e a)) 
         (&lt; (len (rm e b)) (len b))). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>This conjecture may be read ``if <span class="v">a</span> is a subset of the <span class="v">true-listp</span> 
 <span class="v">b</span> and <span class="v">e</span> is a member of <span class="v">a</span>, then the result of removing <span class="v">e</span> 
 from <span class="v">b</span> has a shorter length than <span class="v">b</span>.''</p> 
 
 <p>You can use the following theorem:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Theorem</i>: 
(implies (member u v) 
         (equal (len (rm u v)) 
                (- (len v) 1))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>to <i>rewrite</i> the <i>Goal Conjecture</i> to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Rewritten Goal Conjecture</i>: 
(implies (and (subsetp a b) 
              (true-listp b) 
              (member e a)) 
         (&lt; (- (len b) 1) (len b))). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>To do this you must know that the following subgoal is provable:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Subgoal to Relieve Hyp 1</i>: 
(implies (and (subsetp a b) 
              (true-listp b) 
              (member e a)) 
         (member e b)). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>This is an example of <i>conditional</i> rewriting.  In order to use the 
 <i>Theorem</i> we had to establish that its hypotheses are satisfied.  That is 
 called <i>relieving the hypotheses</i> and was done by proving the <i>Subgoal 
 to Relieve Hyp 1</i>.  Conditional rewriting is the most commonly used proof 
 technique in ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>Unconditional rewriting is just a special case, where there are no 
 hypotheses to relieve.</p> 
 
 <p>Expanding a definition is just another special case, where there are no 
 hypotheses to relieve and the pattern is easy to match because it is a call of 
 a function on distinct variables.</p> 
 
 <p>This page discusses <i>rewriting</i> from the logical perspective.  It is 
 important that you are familiar with the notions of a <i>target</i> term being 
 an <a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED-INSTANCE.html">instance</a> of a 
 <i>pattern</i> term.  We often say the pattern <i>matches</i> the target. 
 These notions involve a corresponding <i>substitution</i> of terms for 
 variables.  All these notions are discussed in the link for ``<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED-INSTANCE.html">instance</a>'' 
 above and we recommend you read it before continuing.  Then use your browser's 
 <b>Back Button</b> to come back here.</p> 
 
 <p>You should also be aware of the terms introduced in our discussion of <a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED-PROPOSITIONAL-CALCULUS.html">propositional 
 calculus</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Rewriting</i> is a fundamental rule of inference in our system.  The 
 rule allows you to use a theorem, i.e., an axiom, lemma, or definition, to 
 replace one term by another in the goal conjecture you're trying to prove.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose you have a theorem that is of the form (or can be put into the 
 form):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Theorem</i>: 
(implies (and <i>hyp1</i> 
              ... 
              <i>hypk</i>) 
         (equal <i>pattern</i> 
                <i>replacement</i>)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>From the logical perspective we don't care how the theorem was actually 
 written when it was proved.  It might have no hypotheses (in which case the 
 <i>hypi</i> could just be <span class="v">t</span>), or it could have been written in a 
 different but equivalent propositional style, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a></span> <i>hyp1</i><span class="v">)
 ...)</span>, or the equality could have been written the other way around, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> </span><i>replacement</i> <i>pattern</i><span class="v">)</span>.  Such syntactic details 
 don't matter.  Just take a theorem and use propositional calculus to rearrange 
 it equivalently into this form for the purposes of this one rewrite step.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose some target term, <i>target</i> that occurs in your goal conjecture 
 is an instance of <i>pattern</i>.  Let the corresponding substitution be 
 <i>sigma</i>.  If <i>sigma</i> does not contain a binding for every variable 
 that occurs in <i>Theorem</i>, then extend <i>sigma</i> to <i>sigma'</i> by 
 adding one binding for each such variable.  (This is necessary only if 
 <i>pattern</i> does not contain every variable in <i>Theorem</i>.)</p> 
 
 <p>Let <i>replacement'</i> be the result of instantiating <i>replacement</i> 
 with <i>sigma'</i>.  Let <i>hypi'</i> be the result of instantiating 
 <i>hypi</i> with <i>sigma'</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>Then the <b>Rewrite Rule of Inference</b> tells us it is permitted to 
 replace that occurrence of <i>target</i> in the goal by <i>replacement'</i> 
 — <b>if you can prove</b> each <i>hypi'</i> in this context.  We make 
 this last condition clear in a moment.</p> 
 
 <p>The justification for this is that <i>Theorem</i> is true for all values of 
 the variables.  Hence, it is true for the values specified by <i>sigma'</i>. 
 If the <i>hypi'</i> are true, then the target is really equal to 
 <i>replacement'</i>.  But it is always permitted to replace something by 
 something it's equal to.</p> 
 
 <p>Rewriting thus involves several steps:</p> 
 
 <p>(1) Finding a <i>target</i> and a <i>theorem</i> to use to rewrite it to 
 some more desirable <i>replacement</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) Instantiating <i>pattern</i> in the (rearranged) theorem to match 
 <i>target</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>(3) Extending <i>sigma</i> to <i>sigma'</i> to bind all the variables in 
 <i>Theorem</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>(4) Establishing that the <i>sigma'</i> instances of each of the 
 <i>hypi</i> hold.  This is called <i>relieving the hypotheses</i> of the 
 theorem and is discussed in greater detail below.</p> 
 
 <p>(5) Replacing the occurrence of <i>target</i> in the goal conjecture by the 
 <i>sigma'</i> instance of <i>replacement</i>, provided all the hypotheses are 
 relieved.</p> 
 
 <p>Step (4) above, <i>relieving the hypotheses</i>, requires first identifying 
 the ``context'' of the target in the goal conjecture.  To do this, use 
 propositional calculus to rearrange the goal conjecture so the occurrence of 
 <i>target</i> is in the conclusion and let <i>context</i> be the 
 hypothesis.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Rearranged Conjecture</i>: 
(implies <i>context</i> 
         (... <i>target</i> ...)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>To relieve the hypotheses you must then prove each of the following 
 subgoals:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Subgoal to Relieve Hyp i</i>: 
(implies <i>context</i> <i>hypi'</i>). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>It is important to note that this description of rewriting with 
 <i>Theorem</i> describes the process from a strictly logical perspective.  The 
 syntax of the theorem and the goal don't matter.  You're free to use 
 propositional calculus to rearrange them to put them into the appropriate 
 forms to fit the descriptions given.  Clearly, if you have a candidate Theorem 
 in the ``wrong'' form and but it can be rearranged with propositional calculus 
 into the ``right'' form, then that rearranged theorem is also a <i>Theorem</i> 
 and can be used as described.  But in the actual implementation of ACL2, the 
 syntactic form of a proved <i>Theorem</i> affects how it is used by rewriting. 
 If a proved theorem takes the form of an implication concluding with an 
 equality, ACL2 treats the left-hand side of the equality as <i>pattern</i> and 
 the right-hand side as <i>replacement</i>, unless you tell it otherwise. 
 We'll discuss this later.</p> 
 
 <p>Furthermore, being from the logical perspective this discussion of 
 rewriting does not address (a) how you extend <i>sigma</i> to <i>sigma'</i> 
 — any extension will do provided it allows you to relieve the 
 hypotheses.  The ACL2 theorem prover uses certain heuristics which we'll 
 discuss later, including methods by which you can guide the system in the 
 selection.</p> 
 
 <p>Crucially, it does not discuss whether it is a <i>good idea</i> to do a 
 particular rewrite!  For example, the definitional equality:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> x)
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> x)
           0
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>may be used repeatedly, endlessly, to replace <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> a)</span> by an ever 
 growing sequence of terms:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> a)
=
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> a)
    0
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> a))))
=
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> a)
    0
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> a))
             0
             (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> a)))))))
= ...</pre> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 implementation of rewriting uses certain heuristics and the you can 
 guide the system in its choices.  We'll discuss this later.</p>
