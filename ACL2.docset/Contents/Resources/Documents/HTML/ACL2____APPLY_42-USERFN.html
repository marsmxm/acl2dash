<p>Undefined function used by <span class="v">apply$</span> on non-primitives</p><p>When <span class="v">apply$</span> is given a non-primitive function symbol it calls 
   this function to determine the results of applying that symbol to the given 
   arguments.  But this function is undefined.  In the proof theory, its value 
   on a given function symbol <span class="v">fn</span> is specified, if at all, by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a></span> for <span class="v">fn</span> which must be available as a hypothesis in the formula 
   being proved.  In the evaluation theory, <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span> has an 
   attachment that makes it behave as though all warrants are assumed.  See 
   <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> for details.</p>
