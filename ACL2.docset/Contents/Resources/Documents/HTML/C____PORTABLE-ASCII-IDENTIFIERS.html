<p>Portable ASCII identifiers.</p><p>We define a notion of C identifiers that are both ASCII and portable, 
     in the sense explained below.</p><p>[C:6.4.2] allows the following characters in identifiers:</p><ol>
<li>The ten numeric digits (but not in the starting position).</li>
<li>The 26 uppercase Latin letters, 
     the 26 lowercase Latin letter, 
     and the underscore.</li>
<li>Some ranges of universal characters 
     (some of which cannot occur in the starting position).</li>
<li>Other implementation-defined characters.</li>
</ol><p>The characters in (1) and (2) are part of the <a href="C____BASIC-SOURCE-CHARP.html">basic source character set</a>. The characters in (3) are presumably not 
     part of the basic source character set, 
     because they are non-ASCII Unicode characters, 
     while the basic source character set 
     maps naturally to ASCII Unicode characters; 
     we say `presumably' because [C] does not seem to explicitly prohibit 
     the use of non-ASCII Unicode characters in the basic source character set 
     (although it seems odd to do that). 
     The  characters in (4) may or may not be 
     part of the basic source character set; 
     [C] imposes no constraints on them.</p><p>Recall that [C] does not require the basic source character set 
     to consist of ASCII characters (see <a href="C____SOURCE-CHARACTER-SET.html">source-character-set</a>). 
     If it does consist of ASCII characters, then 
     the characters in (1) and (2) above are ASCII, 
     the characters in (3) are not ASCII, 
     and the characters in (4) may or may not be ASCII.</p><p>In our formalization of C, we currently assume that 
     source characters includes ASCII characters 
     and the basic source character set consists of ASCII characters. 
     Our model of <a href="C____IDENT.html">identifiers</a> uses ACL2 strings, which consist of ISO 8859-1 characters, 
     which are a superset of the ASCII characters.</p><p>Thus, in order for our identifiers to be both ASCII and portable, 
     they must consist exclusively of characters from (1) and (2) above, 
     without any characters from (3) or (4). 
     If they included characters from (3), they would not be ASCII. 
     If they included characters from (4), they would not be portable, 
     because those additional characters may vary across implementations.</p><p>This leads to our definition of portably ASCII identifiers, 
     which consists of ASCII letters and digits and underscore, 
     with the first character not a digit. 
     They must also be distinct from keywords [C:6.4.2.1/4].</p>
