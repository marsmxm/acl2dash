<p>Testing new or revised XDOC strings</p><p>Contributors to the XDOC manual should check that their XDOC 
 strings are well-formed.  This topic shows an easy way to check 
 well-formedness of XDOC strings, without the need to build the manual.  Also 
 discussed is a way to check for the absence of broken links by building the 
 manual.</p> 
 
 <p>To test a topic, first submit a suitable <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></span> form if 
 necessary, and then to test your topic named, say, <span class="v">FOO</span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "xdoc/top" :dir :system)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> ...) ; or whatever form you have that includes an XDOC string
:doc foo ; a bit noisy and slow the first time, but could do this twice</pre> 
 
 <p>The output should be free of obvious errors.  Otherwise, you can use the 
 error message to debug the error; then submit your form and <span class="v">:doc foo</span> 
 again.</p> 
 
 <p>A XDOC feature (the second ``NEW'' feature in the <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> 
 documentation) avoids the need to invoke <span class="v">:doc</span> explicitly.  In brief: you 
 can simply include community-book <span class="v">xdoc/debug</span>, for example by putting its 
 include-book form in your acl2-customization file (see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION.html">ACL2::ACL2-customization</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Checking for broken links requires you to build the manual; for 
 instructions, see the section ``Building the manual'' in the topic <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION.html">ACL2::books-certification</a>.  This build will create a file 
 <span class="v">books/doc/top.cert.out</span>.  Search in that file for the word ``broken'' and 
 you will find the following report of a broken link:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">;;; ACL2____SOME-BROKEN-LINK:
;;;    from ACL2-DOC</pre> 
 
 <p>If any other broken links are reported, you can modify the parent topic 
 (e.g., <span class="v">ACL2-DOC</span> just above â€” but please leave that one in place!) 
 to fix the indicated broken link.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:short</span> and <span class="v">:long</span> strings, if supplied, must consist entirely 
 of standard characters (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____STANDARD-CHAR-P.html">standard-char-p</a>), except that tabs are also 
 allowed.  Making this check requires you to build the manual (as described 
 just above).</p>
