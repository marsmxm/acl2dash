<p>(primitive) 
simplify the current subterm</p><pre class="code">Examples:
S  -- simplify the current subterm
(<a href="ACL2____S.html">S</a> :backchain-limit 2 :normalize t :expand (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x z))
   -- simplify the current subterm, but during the rewriting
      process, normalization, which will push IFs to the
      top-level, and also force the term (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x z) to be
      expanded during the rewriting process

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> &amp;key rewrite linear normalize backchain-limit repeat in-theory hands-off
        expand)</pre> 
 
 <p>Simplify the current subterm according to the keyword parameters supplied. 
 First <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZATION.html">normalization</a> is applied (unless the <span class="v">:normalize</span> argument is 
 <span class="v">nil</span>), so that for example, each subterm of the form <span class="v">(f ... (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> test x
 y) ...)</span>  is replaced by the term <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> test (f ... x ...) (f ... y ...))</span> 
  except, of course, when <span class="v">f</span> is <span class="v">if</span> and the indicated <span class="v">if</span> 
 subterm is in the second or third argument position.  See <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZE.html">normalize</a> for 
 details.  Then rewriting is applied (unless the rewrite argument is <span class="v">nil</span>). 
 Finally this pair of actions is repeated  until the rewriting step 
 causes no change in the term.  A description of each parameter follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:rewrite -- default t</pre> 
 
 <p>When non-<span class="v">nil</span>, instructs the system to use ACL2's rewriter (or, 
 something close to it) during simplification.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:linear -- default t (except, default nil if :rewrite has value nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>When non-<span class="v">nil</span>, instructs the system to use ACL2's <a href="ACL2____LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">linear arithmetic</a> to build a suitable context (a 
 ``linear pot list'') from the assumptions 
 (the top-level hypotheses and the <a href="ACL2-PC____HYPS.html">governors</a>).  Note that linear arithmetic is used by the 
 rewriter regardless; by default, when <span class="v">:s</span> invokes the rewriter then linear 
 arithmetic can take advantage of the information in the top-level hypotheses 
 and the governors.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:normalize -- default t</pre> 
 
 <p>When non-<span class="v">nil</span>, instructs the system to use <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZATION.html">normalization</a> (as 
 described above) during simplification.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:backchain-limit -- default 0</pre> 
 
 <p>Sets the number of recursive calls to the rewriter that are allowed for 
 backchaining.  Even with the default of 0, some reasoning is allowed 
 (technically speaking, type-set reasoning is allowed) in the relieving of 
 hypotheses.  The value should be <span class="v">nil</span> or a non-negative integer, and 
 limits backchaining only for rewriting, not for type-set reasoning.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:repeat -- default 0</pre> 
 
 <p>Sets the number of times the current term is to be rewritten.  If this 
 value is <span class="v">t</span>, then the default is used (as specified by the constant 
 <span class="v">*default-s-repeat-limit*</span>).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:in-theory, :hands-off, :expand</pre> 
 
 <p>These have their usual meaning; see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> if conditional rewrite rules are used that cause case splits 
 because of the use of <span class="v">force</span>, then appropriate new subgoals will be 
 created, i.e., with the same current subterm (and address) but with each new 
 (forced) hypothesis being negated and then used to create a corresponding new 
 subgoal.  In that case, the current goal will have all such new hypotheses 
 added to the list of top-level hypotheses.</p>
