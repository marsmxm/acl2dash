<p>Screen printing performed by event macros.</p><p>Event macros normally print messages on then screen when they run. 
     At a minimum, they should print error messages, 
     e.g. when user inputs do not pass validation. 
     Event macros are run to produce <a href="ACL2____EVENT-MACRO-RESULTS.html">results</a>, namely events and sometimes files, 
     which should be typically printed on the screen 
     to confirm that the event macro has done its job, 
     and also to inform the user of some details of the results. 
     Sometimes it is useful to have event macros 
     print additional information as they run, 
     about their internal operation, 
     e.g. to help debug when they do not seem to behave as expected. 
     Furthermore, a user may sometimes want to see 
     the complete output produced by ACL2 in response to 
     the events produced by an event macro, 
     not just the external (i.e. exported) events, 
     but also the internal (i.e. local) events. 
     In certain cases, a user may want to suppress all screen output, 
     including any error messages.</p><p>The above discussion suggests five ordered levels of screen printing, 
     specified by the <span class="v">:print</span> input of 
     the event macros that adhere to this convention, 
     i.e. the event macros whose user documentation references this manual page. 
     The ordered printing levels, 
     which are the possible values of the <span class="v">:print</span> input, 
     are</p><pre class="code">nil &lt; :error &lt; :result &lt; :info &lt; :all</pre><p>where the amount of printed material increases monotonically.</p><p>When <span class="v">:print</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     nothing is printed (not even errors).</p><p>When <span class="v">:print</span> is <span class="v">:error</span>, 
     only errors (if any) are printed.</p><p>When <span class="v">:print</span> is <span class="v">:result</span>, 
     besides errors (if any), 
     also the <a href="ACL2____EVENT-MACRO-RESULTS.html">results</a> of the event macro are printed, 
     as described in the manual page just referenced.</p><p>When <span class="v">:print</span> is <span class="v">:info</span>, 
     besides errors (if any) and results, 
     also some additional information about the event macro's operation 
     is printed.</p><p>When <span class="v">:print</span> is <span class="v">:all</span>, 
     besides errors (if any), results, and additional information, 
     also all the ACL2 output in response to the submitted events is printed</p>
