<p>Tag-trees</p><p>Many low-level ACL2 functions take and return ``tag trees'' or 
 ``ttrees'' (pronounced ``tee-trees'') which contain useful information such as 
 the lemmas used, the linearize assumptions made, etc.  Here we present only 
 minimal user-level information, for example in support of the use of the <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> utility or writing metafunctions.  Implementation-level 
 information about tag trees may be found in the Developer's Guide; users 
 should probably not visit <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-UTILITIES.html">that 
 topic</a> unless they plan to become ACL2 developers.</p> 
 
 <p>Abstractly a tag-tree represents a list of sets, each member set having a 
 name given by one of the ``tags'' (which are symbols) of the ttree.  The 
 elements of the set named <span class="v">tag</span> are all of the objects tagged <span class="v">tag</span> in 
 the tree.</p> 
 
 <p>The rewriter, for example, takes a term and a ttree (among other things), 
 and returns a new term, term', and new ttree, ttree'.  Term' is equivalent to 
 term (under the current assumptions) and the ttree' is an extension of ttree. 
 If we focus just on the set associated with the tag <span class="v">LEMMA</span> in the ttrees, 
 then the set for ttree' is the extension of that for ttree obtained by 
 unioning into it all the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s used by the rewrite.  The set associated 
 with <span class="v">LEMMA</span> can be obtained by <span class="v">(tagged-objects 'LEMMA ttree)</span>.</p>
