<p><a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">Break-Rewrite</a> Commands</p><p>Many commands display terms that are abbreviated (``eviscerated'') 
  by default.  These have corresponding commands with a ``+'' suffix that avoid 
  such abbreviation, as shown below; also see <a href="ACL2____BRR-EVISC-TUPLE.html">brr-evisc-tuple</a>.  For 
  example, the notation ``<span class="v">:ancestors[+]</span>'' below indicates that the 
  <span class="v">:ancestors</span> command may abbreviate terms but the <span class="v">:ancestors+</span> command 
  does not.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:a!                abort to ACL2 top-level
:ancestors[+]      negations of backchaining hypotheses being pursued
:btm[+]            bottom-most frame in :path
:eval              try rule and re-enter break afterwards
:eval!             :eval but no recursive breaks

:initial-ttree[+]  ttree before :eval (see :DOC ttree)
:lhs               left-hand side of rule's conclusion (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a>, in the case
                     of :rewrite-quoted-constant rules of form [2], the
                     right-hand side!)

:path[+]           rewriter's path from top clause to :target
:poly-list[+]      list of polynomials (after :eval) of a linear rule,
                     where the leading term of each is enclosed in an
                     extra set of parentheses
:rewritten-rhs[+]  rewritten :rhs (after :eval) of a rewrite rule
:rhs               right-hand side of rule's conclusion (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a>, in the case
                     of :rewrite-quoted-constant rules of form [2], the

:standard-help     :help message from ACL2 top-level
:target[+]         term being rewritten
:top[+]            top-most frame in :path
:type-alist[+]     type assumptions governing :target
:unify-subst[+]    substitution making :lhs equal :target
:wonp              indicates whether application succeeded (after :eval)</pre> 
 
 <p>See the discussion of form [2] <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE-QUOTED-CONSTANT.html">rewrite-quoted-constant</a></span> rules 
 for an explanation of the swapped meanings of ``<span class="v">:lhs</span>'' and 
 ``<span class="v">:rhs</span>.''</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">Break-rewrite</a> is just a call of the standard ACL2 read-eval-print 
 loop, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>, on a ``<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>'' <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  Thus, you may 
 execute most commands you might normally execute at the top-level of ACL2. 
 However, all <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> changes you cause from within <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> 
 are lost when you exit or <span class="v">:eval</span> the rule.  You cannot modify <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s from within the break.  See <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> for more details and 
 see <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> for general information about the standard ACL2 read-eval-print 
 loop.  Also see <a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a> for a utility that can return a value for many of 
 the keywords above, instead of merely printing to the screen.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that if you are breaking on a <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> rule, 
 several of the commands listed above do not apply: <span class="v">:lhs</span>, <span class="v">:rhs</span>, 
 <span class="v">:initial-ttree</span>, and <span class="v">:final-ttree</span>.  Moreover, <span class="v">:rewritten-rhs</span> 
 also does not apply, but instead, <span class="v">:poly-list</span> shows the result of applying 
 the linear lemma as a list of polynomials, implicitly conjoined.  The leading 
 term of each polynomial is enclosed in an extra set of parentheses.</p>
