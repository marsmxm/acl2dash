<p>Static safety checking of Yul.</p><p>This is (the main) part of the Yul static semantics. 
     It consists of checks that ensure the safety of execution, 
     i.e. that certain situations never happen during execution, 
     such as reading or writing a non-existent variable. 
     Our formal 
     <a href="YUL____DYNAMIC-SEMANTICS.html">dynamic semantics</a> 
     of Yul defensively checks these conditions, 
     returning error values when the conditions are not satisfied. 
     The static safety checks formalized here 
     ensure that those error values are never returned by the dynamic semantics, 
     as proved in <a href="YUL____STATIC-SOUNDNESS.html">static-soundness</a>.</p><p>The static safety of the Yul constructs is checked with respect to 
     (i) a set of variable names (identifiers) and 
     (ii) an omap from function names (identifiers) 
     to function input/output information. 
     These are essentially symbol tables for variables and functions: 
     they describe the variables and functions in scope.</p><p>These symbol tables for variables consists of 
     the variables that are not only visible, but also accessible, 
     according to [Yul: Specification of Yul: Scoping Rules]: 
     a variable is visible in the rest of the block in which it is declared, 
     including sub-blocks, 
     but it is not accessible in 
     function definitions in the block or sub-blocks. 
     Variables that are visible but inaccessible 
     are not represented in these symbol tables for variables.</p><p>The Yul static semantics requires that 
     visible but inaccessible variables are not shadowed 
     [Yul: Specification of Yul: Scoping Rules]. 
     However, this requirement is not needed for safety, 
     as evidenced by the fact that 
     the static soundness proof in <a href="YUL____STATIC-SOUNDNESS.html">static-soundness</a> 
     does not make use of that requirement. 
     In fact, we do not include that requirement in the static safety checks 
     formalized here. 
     This requirement is separately formalized 
     in  <a href="YUL____STATIC-SHADOWING-CHECKING.html">static-shadowing-checking</a>.</p>
