<p>Static safety checking of Yul.</p><p>This is (the main) part of the Yul static semantics. 
     It consists of checks that ensure the safety of execution, 
     i.e. that certain situations never happens during execution, 
     such as reading or writing a non-existent variable. 
     Our formal dynamic semantics of Yul defensively checks these conditions, 
     returning error values when the conditions are not satisfied. 
     The static safety checks formalized here 
     ensure that those error values are never returned by the dynamic semantics, 
     as we will formally prove soon.</p>
