<p>Important warnings about network security and the ACL2 bridge.</p><p>The ACL2 bridge allows clients to run arbitrary Lisp commands, 
including for instance syscall.  Because of this,</p> 
 
<div class="box"><p>If a malicious person can connect to your bridge, then he can read or 
delete your files, run arbitrary programs as you, and so on.</p></div> 
 
<p>To reduce the chances of this happening, you should probably only run the 
bridge on a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket" target="_blank"><nobr>unix 
domain socket<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_domain_socket"></nobr></a>.  These sockets appear to have good security 
properties.  (Per my understanding: remote users on the internet cannot connect 
to them, and they even offer some protection from other users on your system 
through the normal Unix filesystem permissions.)</p> 
 
<p>The bridge <i>can</i> also be run on an ordinary TCP/IP socket, <b><font color="#ff0000">but this is very scary</font></b> because remote clients can 
connect.  If you decide to run it this very scary way, then you should be very 
scared:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The bridge has <b>no authentication</b> mechanism, and will allow anyone 
who can connect to it to run any command.</li> 
 
<li>The bridge sends all messages in <b>plain text</b>, so an eavesdropper can 
probably see everything you send to the server and everything it sends 
back.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>So, before you even <i>think</i> about putting the bridge on a TCP/IP port, 
you should make sure that, e.g., you have firewalls in place or are using SSH 
tunnels or something.</p> 
 
<p><b>Disclaimer</b>.  I am no security expert.  The advice above is probably 
not enough to protect you.  Please do not use the ACL2 Bridge without 
consulting your local security expert and network administrator.</p>
