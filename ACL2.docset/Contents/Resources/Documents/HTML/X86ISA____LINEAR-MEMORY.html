<p>Linear Memory Accessor and Updater Functions</p><p>First, a quick note about virtual, linear, and physical 
  addresses:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 <li>
<i>Linear (or Virtual) Address:</i> In the flat memory model (see 
 Intel Vol. 1, Section 3.3.1), memory appears to a program as a single, 
 continuous address space, called a linear (or virtual) address 
 space. An address for any byte in linear address space is called a 
 linear address.  When paging is disabled, then a linear address is the 
 same as a physical address.</li> 
 
 <li>
<i>Physical Address:</i> The memory that the processor addresses 
 on its bus is called physical memory. Physical memory is organized as 
 a sequence of 8-bit bytes. Each byte is assigned a unique address, 
 called a physical address. When employing the processor's memory 
 management facilities, programs do not directly address physical 
 memory.</li> 
 
</ul>
