<p>Representation of ranges on wire declarations, instance array 
declarations, and so forth.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>msb — <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>lsb — <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>Ranges are discussed in Section 7.1.5.</p> 
 
<p>Ranges in declarations and array instances look like <span class="v">[msb:lsb]</span>, but do 
not confuse them with part-select expressions which have the same syntax.</p> 
 
<p>The expressions in the <span class="v">msb</span> and <span class="v">lsb</span> positions are expected to 
resolve to constants.  Note that the parser does not try to simplify these 
expressions, but some simplification is performed in transformations such as 
<a href="VL2014____RANGERESOLVE.html">rangeresolve</a> and <a href="VL2014____UNPARAMETERIZATION.html">unparameterization</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Even after the expressions have become constants, the Verilog-2005 standard 
does not require <span class="v">msb</span> to be greater than <span class="v">lsb</span>, and neither index is 
required to be zero.  In fact, even negative indicies seem to be permitted, 
which is quite amazing and strange.</p> 
 
<p>While we do not impose any restrictions in <span class="v">vl-range-p</span> itself, some 
transformations expect the indices to be resolved to integers.  However, we now 
try to support the use of both ascending and descending ranges.</p>
