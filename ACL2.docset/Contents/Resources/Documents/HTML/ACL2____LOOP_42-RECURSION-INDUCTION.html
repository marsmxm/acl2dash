<p>Advice on inductive theorems about <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span>-recursive functions</p><p><b>Warning:</b> This documentation topic is fairly preliminary 
  because we do not have a lot of experience yet with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42-RECURSION.html">loop$-recursion</a></span>.  We assume here that readers are familiar 
  with the topics cited above.</p> 
 
  <h3>Definductor</h3> 
 
  <p>The principles sketched here are illustrated concretely in the tutorial 
  community book <span class="v">projects/apply/copy-nat-tree.lisp</span>.  As noted in that 
  book, the inductions are hinted manually so the reader can see from first 
  principles what is involved.  However, in the book <span class="v">projects/apply/top</span> we 
  provide a utility that sometimes automates the creation of the inductive hint 
  function and associates it with the given <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive function.  See 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINDUCTOR.html">definductor</a></span>.  The examples worked manually in <span class="v">copy-nat-tree.lisp</span> 
  are recapitulated towards the end of 
  <span class="v">projects/apply/definductor-tests.lisp</span>, without the manually provided 
  hints.  In addition, the book 
  <span class="v">projects/apply/loop-recursion-examples.lisp</span> gives some other examples of 
  loop$-recursive functions and inductive theorems about them.</p> 
 
  <h3>Some Basic Principles for Inductive Proofs about <span class="v">Loop$</span>-Recursive Functions</h3> 
 
  <p>If ACL2 did not have <span class="v">loop$</span>, functions defined in terms of 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursion would have to be defined with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span>.

  <p>Without <span class="v">loop$</span> the latter function would have to be defined this way. 
  We name it <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree</span>, where the ``<span class="v">mr</span>'' reminds us this is 
  part of a mutually recursive clique.</p>

         x))
    (t (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'nats
             (mr-copy-nat-tree-list (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))))))

   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a>
    ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> x) nil)
    (t (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (mr-copy-nat-tree (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))
             (mr-copy-nat-tree-list (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))))))</pre> 
 
  <p>Note that we define <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree</span> by copying the definition of 
  <span class="v">copy-nat-tree</span> (renaming recursive calls appropriately) but replacing the 
  use of <span class="v">loop$</span> in <span class="v">copy-nat-tree</span> with a call of a mutually-recursive 
  function here called <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree-list</span>.  We call 
  <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree-list</span> the ``list counterpart'' of <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree</span>. 
  However, in general there may be more than just two functions in the clique 
  and so we refer generically to <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree-list</span> as a ``co-member'' 
  of the clique.</p> 
 
  <p>How would you prove theorems about <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree</span>?  Four principles 
  are known to most ACL2 users of <span class="v">mutual-recursion</span>.  These principles 
  apply to <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions as well as to mutually recursive 
  ones.  We state them here in terms of both kinds of definitions.</p> 
 
  <ul> 
 
  <li>While simple recursive functions suggest ``appropriate'' inductions, 
  mutually recursive functions and <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions do not.  If 
  you want to prove a theorem about such functions you have to arrange some 
  kind of induction hint.</li> 
 
  <li>You can't generally prove an isolated theorem about a single member of a 
  mutually recursive clique or a <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive function.  Instead, you 
  must state a conjecture about every member of the clique, conjoin all those 
  theorems together, and prove them inductively all at once.  Applied to 
  proving a theorem about <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree</span> this advice means we must 
  conjoin the theorem about that function with ``the same'' theorem about 
  <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree-list</span>, and more generally with theorems about every 
  co-member of the clique.  Of course, what we mean by ``the same'' theorem 
  about different members of the clique depends on what each member contributes 
  to the overall computation.  Applied to the <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive function 
  <span class="v">copy-nat-tree</span> this advice means we must simultaneously prove a theorem 
  about every <span class="v">loop$</span> in the function.</li> 
 
  <li>Inductively provable theorems must be sufficiently general.  When dealing 
  with a mutually recursive clique, each conjunct must address itself to the 
  ``general'' call of the co-member in question, e.g., to 
  <span class="v">(mr-copy-nat-tree-list x)</span> not to the specific call inside 
  <span class="v">mr-copy-nat-tree</span>, which is <span class="v">(mr-copy-nat-tree-list (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))</span>.  When 
  dealing with a <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive function, each conjunct must address 
  itself to the general target, not to specific target in the <span class="v">loop$</span> 
  recursive function.  In the case of the <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive function 
  <span class="v">copy-nat-tree</span> we need a conjunct about <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a> for e in x
  collect (copy-nat-tree e))</span>, not about <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a> for e in (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)
  collect (copy-nat-tree e))</span>.</li> 
 
  <li>Finally, the induction scheme used must provide an inductive hypothesis 
  about every recursive call of every co-member of the clique or, in the case 
  of <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursion, about every recursive unwinding of each 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>.</li> 
 
  </ul> 
 
  <p><b>Remember:</b> Because <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions call themselves 
  recursively with <span class="v">apply$</span>, any theorem about a <span class="v">loop$</span> recursive 
  function must almost certainly include a warrant hypothesis for that 
  function!</p> 
 
  <p>We illustrate these principles in the community book 
  <span class="v">projects/apply/copy-nat-list.lisp</span>.</p>
