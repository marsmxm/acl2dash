<p>Checks that a tree is a legitimate leftist tree</p><p>Checks that a tree is a legitimate Leftist Tree.  The basic 
 recursive requirements are: * both the left and right sub-trees are proper 
 * (rank) the rank is 1 + the rank of the right sub-tree * (leftist) the rank 
 of right sub-tree is less than or equal to the rank of the left sub-tree * 
 (heap-ordered) if either of the sub-trees are non-trivial, then their roots 
 are larger than the root of the tree</p>
