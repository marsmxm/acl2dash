<p>Introduce prefix/remainder theorems for a lexing function.</p><p>Many of our lexing routines take <span class="v">echars</span>, an <a href="VL2014____VL-ECHARLIST-P.html">vl-echarlist-p</a>, as input, and split this list into a <span class="v">prefix</span> and 
<span class="v">remainder</span>.  This macro allows us to quickly prove several common 
properties about such a function.  In particular, we show:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">prefix</span> is always a true-listp, and furthermore it is also a 
vl-echarlist-p as long as the <span class="v">echars</span> is.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">remainder</span> is a true-listp exactly when <span class="v">echars</span> is, and furthermore 
it is a vl-echarlist-p whenever <span class="v">echars</span> is.</li> 
 
<li>Appending the <span class="v">prefix</span> and <span class="v">remainder</span> always returns the original 
<span class="v">echars</span>.  A corollary is that whenever <span class="v">prefix</span> is empty, <span class="v">remainder</span> 
is the whole of <span class="v">echars</span>.</li> 
 
<li>The acl2-count of <span class="v">remainder</span> is never greater than that of <span class="v">echars</span>, 
and strictly decreases whenever <span class="v">prefix</span> is non-nil.</li> 
 
</ul>
