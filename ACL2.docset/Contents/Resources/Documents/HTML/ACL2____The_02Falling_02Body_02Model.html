<p>The Falling Body Model</p><p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/pisa.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <p>One particularly famous and very simple model is the equation of a falling 
 body: the distance d an object falls is proportional to the square of the time 
 t.  If the time is measured in seconds and the distance in feet, the equation 
 relating these two is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">       2
d = 16t</pre> 
 
 <p>This equation is a <b>model</b> of falling objects.  It can be used to 
 predict how long it takes a cannonball to fall from the top of a 200 foot 
 tower (3.5 seconds).  This might be important if your product is designed to 
 drop cannonballs on moving targets.</p>
