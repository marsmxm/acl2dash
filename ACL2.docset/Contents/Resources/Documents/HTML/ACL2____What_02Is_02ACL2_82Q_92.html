<p>What Is ACL2?</p><p><a href="ACL2____What_02is_02a_02Mathematical_02Logic_82Q_92.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/flying.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 is a <b>mathematical logic</b> together with a <b>mechanical theorem 
 prover</b> to help you reason in the logic.</p> 
 
 <p>The logic is just a subset of applicative <a href="ACL2____Common_02Lisp.html">Common Lisp</a>.  (This link takes you off the main route of 
 the tour.  You'll see some Common Lisp on the tour, so visit this later!)</p> 
 
 <p>The theorem prover is an ``industrial strength'' version of the Boyer-Moore 
 theorem prover, Nqthm.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Models</b> of all kinds of computing systems can be built in ACL2, just 
 as in Nqthm, even though the formal logic is Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>Once you've built an ACL2 model of a system, you can run it.</p> 
 
 <p>You can also use ACL2 to prove theorems about the model.</p>
