<p>Functions for working with hierarchical identifiers.</p><p>Perhaps the most fundamental operation for a hierarchical 
identifier is figure out what it refers to.  This turns out to be a 
surprisingly challenging and nuanced process.</p> 
 
<p>Our top-level routine for following hierarchical identifiers is <a href="VL____VL-FOLLOW-HIDEXPR.html">vl-follow-hidexpr</a>.  It is meant to make looking up hierarchical identifiers 
convenient despite these complications.</p> 
 
<p>We now describe some of these challenges and how <a href="VL____VL-FOLLOW-HIDEXPR.html">vl-follow-hidexpr</a> 
deals with them.</p> 
 
<dl> 
 
<dt>Datatypes versus Scopes</dt> 
 
<dd>Challenge: The same syntax is used to refer to both data structure members 
like <span class="v">myinst.opcode</span> and also to scopes like <span class="v">mysubmod.mywire</span>.  However, 
structures and scopes are very different and need to be traversed in different 
ways.</dd> 
 
<dd>Our Approach: <a href="VL____VL-FOLLOW-HIDEXPR.html">vl-follow-hidexpr</a> follows only the scope-based part of 
the HID.  However, as one of our return values, we provide the tail of the 
hierarchical index that leads into this variable.  For instance, in a case like 
<span class="v">foo.bar.myinst.opcode</span> where <span class="v">myinst</span> is an <span class="v">instruction_t</span> structure 
variable, we will follow only until the declaration of <span class="v">myinst</span> and then we 
will return <span class="v">myinst.opcode</span> as the tail.</dd> 
 
 
<dt>Unclear Destination</dt> 
 
<dd>Challenge: Depending on the kind of analysis being done, we might want to 
continue or stop resolving at certain points.  For instance, if we are trying 
to size a hierarchical identifier like <span class="v">myinterface.ready</span>, we probably want 
to follow through the interface all the way to the <span class="v">ready</span> signal.  However, 
for light-weight variable use analysis, we may want to stop as soon as we hit 
an interface.</dd> 
 
<dd>Our Approach: <a href="VL____VL-FOLLOW-HIDEXPR.html">vl-follow-hidexpr</a> follows the HID as far as possible, 
but returns a <a href="VL____VL-HIDTRACE-P.html">vl-hidtrace-p</a> that includes not only the final declaration 
we arrive at, but also all intermediate points along the way.  If you only care 
about the final destination (e.g., the <span class="v">ready</span> signal for sizing or similar) 
then you can get this final destination from the first <a href="VL____VL-HIDSTEP-P.html">vl-hidstep-p</a> in 
the trace.  But if you also want to know, e.g., that <span class="v">myinterface</span> has been 
used, this information can easily be extracted from the rest of the trace.</dd> 
 
 
<dt>Unresolved Parameters</dt> 
 
<dd>Challenge: Because of parameters, we may not be able to tell whether the 
indices in a hierarchical identifier are valid.  For instance, if there is an 
array of module instances like <span class="v">mymod myarr [width-1:0] (...)</span> and we are 
trying to follow a hierarchical reference like <span class="v">foo.bar.myarr[7].baz</span>, then 
we will not know whether this is valid until we have resolved <span class="v">width</span>.</dd> 
 
<dd>In some applications, e.g., for <a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a>, it may be best to allow 
these potentially invalid indices.  After all, we "know" that this reference 
is either invalid or is a reference to <span class="v">baz</span> within <span class="v">mymod</span>.  In that 
case, we may well wish to assume that the index will be valid and just go on 
and find <span class="v">baz</span>.</dd> 
 
<dd>However, some other applications have more stringent soundness constraints. 
If we are writing transforms that are meant to build conservative, safe, formal 
models of the Verilog code, we may instead want to insist that all of the 
indices have been resolved and cause an error if this is not the case.</dd> 
 
<dd>Our Approach: <a href="VL____VL-FOLLOW-HIDEXPR.html">vl-follow-hidexpr</a> always tries to check that indices 
are in bounds and to cause errors when indices are clearly out of bounds.  If 
we encounter indices that are potentially out of bounds, then we can do one of 
two things: 
 
<ul> 
<li>By default, we are permissive and assume the index will be in bounds.</li> 
<li>However, if <span class="v">:strictp</span> is enabled, we will cause an error.</li> 
</ul>
</dd> 
 
<dd>As a special note: we always require generate array indices to be resolved. 
See <a href="VL____VL-FOLLOW-HIDEXPR.html">vl-follow-hidexpr</a> for additional discussion.</dd> 
 
<dt>Error reporting</dt> 
 
<dd>Challenge: A HID may be invalid in many different ways.  Any part of the 
HID may try to refer to a name that does not exist, and any index along the HID 
might be invalid.  If an error occurs, we should provide enough detail to 
understand the problem.</dd> 
 
<dd>Our Approach: In the case of any error, <a href="VL____VL-FOLLOW-HIDEXPR.html">vl-follow-hidexpr</a> returns a 
message.  Callers should put this message in the appropriate context so 
that the end-user can understand the nature and location of the problem.</dd>
