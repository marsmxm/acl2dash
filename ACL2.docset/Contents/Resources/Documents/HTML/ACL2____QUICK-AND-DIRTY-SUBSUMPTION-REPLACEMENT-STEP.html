<p>(advanced topic) controlling a heuristic in the prover's clausifier</p><p>This topic is probably only of interest to those who are 
 undertaking particularly complex proof developments.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 prover's handling of propositional logic uses a heuristic that we 
 believe might cause the prover to slow down significantly or even to trigger a 
 stack overflow.  However, we believe these negative effects are only felt on 
 very large formulas  formulas that are likely to cause similar 
 degradation of many other parts of ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>The following two events turn off that heuristic (by eliminating calls to 
 source function <span class="v">quick-and-dirty-subsumption-replacement-step</span>, after which 
 this <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic is named).</p>

  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IGNORE.html">ignore</a> cl1 ac)
           (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :mode :logic :guard t))
  nil)

 <p>However, if you feel the need to try this out, please remember that the 
 proof is likely to fail anyway since other parts of ACL2 will probably be 
 stressed.  A more basic problem with your proof strategy may exist: the 
 formulas are getting extraordinarily large.  A common approach for avoiding 
 such problem include disabling functions (see <a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a>).  Other less 
 common approaches might help if you are sufficiently desperate, such as 
 defining your own <span class="v">IF</span> function to use in place of the built-in 
 <span class="v">IF</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>For an example of where this capability has proven useful, see 
 <a href="ACL2____WITHOUT-SUBSUMPTION.html">without-subsumption</a>.  That tool uses <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a></span> 
 as well, since that is another way to control the prover's handling of 
 propositional logic.</p>
