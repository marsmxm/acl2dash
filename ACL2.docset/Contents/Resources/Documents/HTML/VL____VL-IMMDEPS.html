<p>Results of collecting up immediate dependencies.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>all-okp — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Were we able to successfully resolve every identifier we 
              encountered?  Even when this is <span class="v">nil</span>, we may be able to 
              provide at least mostly accurate dependency information.</dd> 
 
<dt>deps — <a href="ACL2____STRING-LISTP.html">string-listp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>List of dependencies that have been collected.  Note that for 
              compatibility with <a href="DEPGRAPH____TOPOSORT.html">depgraph::toposort</a>, we <b>exclude</b> any 
              dependencies that are not found as top-level design elements. 
              For instance, if we find a module instance of module <span class="v">foo</span>, 
              but <span class="v">foo</span> is not defined, we do <i>not</i> include a 
              dependency on <span class="v">foo</span>.</dd> 
 
<dt>warnings — <a href="VL____VL-WARNINGLIST.html">vl-warninglist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Any warnings accumulated during the process of collecting these 
              dependencies.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>It might be better to turn <span class="v">deps</span> into a fast association list 
binding names we've seen to T, since there will likely be many duplicates. 
But, for now, we'll just use a simple list-based version.  It would be easy to 
change this: just modify <a href="VL____VL-IMMDEPS-ADD-RAW-DEPENDENCY.html">vl-immdeps-add-raw-dependency</a> and <a href="VL____VL-IMMDEPGRAPH-MERGE.html">vl-immdepgraph-merge</a>.</p>
