</dl><p>In the abstract syntax, 
    we use character strings 
    for the rule names described in [RFC:2.1] 
    and by the rule <span class="v">rulename</span> in [RFC:4]. 
    We abstract away the restrictions on the characters allowed in rule names, 
    which [RFC:4] requires to start with a letter 
    and only use letters, digits, and dashes; 
    these are ACL2 characters. 
    These restrictions are captured by the notion of <a href="ABNF____RULENAME-WFP.html">well-formed rule names</a>, which also requires all the letters to be lowercase, 
    as a normalized representation of rule names, 
    which are case-insensitive [RFC:2.1].</p>
