<p>A representation for structured data.</p><p>A <b>pattern</b> is a simple kind of structure for representing 
structured data.</p> 
 
<p>Patterns were historically used in the EMOD hardware simulator, where they 
played a large role.  In <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> we have largely moved toward just using 
alists instead of patterns, but patterns are still used in a few places, most 
notably the representation of module input and output lists.</p> 
 
<p>A definition for patterns is:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">NIL</span> is a special, empty pattern</li> 
 
<li>Any non-nil atom is a <b>pattern variable</b> (a kind of pattern), and</li> 
 
<li>A cons of two patterns is a pattern.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This means that any ACL2 object is a pattern, but here is perhaps a typical 
example of a pattern:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(a (b0 b1) (c (d0 d1) e))    ;; example pattern</pre> 
 
<p>We say that this pattern is <b>compatible</b> with certain other ACL2 
objects that have a similar cons structure, such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(1 (2 3) (4 (5 6) 7))        ;; example data</pre> 
 
<p>The general idea is that the example data "fits" into the pattern by 
saying:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">a = 1   b0 = 2   c = 4   d0 = 5   e = 7
        b1 = 3           d1 = 6</pre> 
 
<p>Another way of thinking about patterns is as follows.  Consider an alist 
like <span class="v">((a . 1) (b . 2) (c . 3))</span>.  It is often convenient to have the keys 
and values together.  But if you remember that your keys are <span class="v">(a b c)</span>, then 
you could separately work with your values, <span class="v">(1 2 3)</span>.  This is the basic 
idea behind patterns, except that the keys and values can be structured instead 
of just being lists.</p> 
 
<p>This is a little awkward, and it would probably usually be better to just 
work with alists everywhere.</p>
