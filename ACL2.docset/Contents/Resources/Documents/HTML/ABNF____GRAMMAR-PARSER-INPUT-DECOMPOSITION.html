<p>Input decomposition theorems for the parser of ABNF grammars.</p><p>If parsing succeeds, 
     the string at the leaves of the returned tree(s) 
     consists of the consumed natural numbers in the input. 
     That is, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a></span>ing the string at the leaves with the remaining input 
     yields the original input. 
     More precisely, it yields the original input 
     fixed according to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NAT-LIST-FIX.html">nat-list-fix</a></span>, 
     because the parsing functions fix their input; 
     an alternative formulation is to avoid <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NAT-LIST-FIX.html">nat-list-fix</a></span> 
     but include the hypothesis that the input satisfies <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NAT-LISTP.html">nat-listp</a></span>.</p><p>The input decomposition theorem of <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____PARSE-ANY.html">parse-any</a></span> 
     does not involve trees but makes an analogous statement: 
     concatenating the returned natural number with the remaining input 
     yields the original input.</p><p>The input decomposition proof of each parsing function uses, 
     as rewrite rules, 
     the input decomposition theorems of the parsing functions called by 
     the parsing function whose theorem is being proved. 
     The proofs also use the definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-_E3STRING.html">tree-&gt;string</a></span>, 
     which we enable just before these theorems and disable just after.</p>
