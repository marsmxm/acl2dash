<p>Event generation performed by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFARBREC.html">defarbrec</a></span>.</p><p>Some events are generated in two slightly different forms: 
     a form that is local to the generated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, 
     and a form that is exported from the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>. 
     Proof hints are in the former but not in the latter, 
     thus keeping the ACL2 history ``clean''.</p><p>Other events are generated only locally in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, 
     without any exported counterparts. 
     These have automatically generated fresh names: 
     the names used so far 
     are threaded through the event generation functions below.</p><p>Other events are only exported from the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, 
     without any local counterparts.</p><p>The generated events, and particularly the proofs hints, 
     follow the template in the file <span class="v">defarbrec-template.lisp</span>, 
     which is referred to as `template' 
     in the documentation of the event generation functions below.</p>
