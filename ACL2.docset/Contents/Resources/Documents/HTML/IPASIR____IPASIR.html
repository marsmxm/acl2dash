<p>ACL2 bindings for the ipasir incremental SAT solving interface</p><p>IPASIR is a simple C interface to incremental SAT solvers.  (It 
stands for Reentrant Incremental Sat solver API, in reverse.) This interface is 
supported by a few different solvers because it is used in the SAT 
competition's incremental track.  The ipasir distribution, containing the 
interface and some sample solvers, can be found at <a href="https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir" target="_blank"><nobr>this GitHub repository<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/biotomas/ipasir"></nobr></a>.  The 
ACL2 ipasir library is an attempt to semi-soundly allow ACL2 programs to 
interface with such SAT solver libraries.</p> 
 
<h3>Getting Started</h3> 
 
<p>First, if you just want to reason about an incremental solver without 
actually running it, you can include "ipasir-logic.lisp", which sets up the 
abstract stobj representing the solver and its logical story, but doesn't 
install the under-the-hood backend and therefore doesn't require any trust 
tags.  Additionally, "ipasir-tools.lisp" builds on that to create some useful 
shortcuts, also without any trust tags.</p> 
 
<p>To load the backend, include "ipasir-backend.lisp".  This book first loads 
the shared library specified by the environment variable 
IPASIR_SHARED_LIBRARY, which should contain the path to a SAT solver shared 
library. It then overrides the executable definitions of the ipasir interface 
functions so that they instead call the appropriate functions from the shared 
library.</p> 
 
<p>There are several SAT solver libraries that implement the IPASIR interface; 
to obtain one, see <a href="IPASIR____BUILDING-AN-IPASIR-SOLVER-LIBRARY.html">building-an-ipasir-solver-library</a>.</p> 
 
<h3>Using ipasir functions</h3> 
 
<p>Note: If you are familiar with ipasir, you'll notice that the ACL2 wrappers 
work slightly differently than the underlying ipasir implementation.  The 
differences are listed below under "Departures from the C Interface."</p> 
 
<p>The following interfacing 
functions are provided:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-INIT.html">ipasir-init</a> ipasir state)</span> initializes the solver object so that other 
functions can then be used.  This is already done for you if you use 
<span class="v">with-local-ipasir</span>.  It requires that the state of the solver is 
<span class="v">:undef</span> and it puts the solver in state <span class="v">:input</span>.  It takes and returns 
state because (in the logical story) it reads the oracle into the <span class="v">init</span> 
field in order to eliminate a source of unsoundness.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-REINIT.html">ipasir-reinit</a> ipasir)</span> initializes a solver object, just like 
<span class="v">ipasir-init</span>, except that it has an additional guard, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a>
ipasir.history)</span>, which ensures that it can only be called on a solver that 
has previously been initialized and subsequently released.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-RELEASE.html">ipasir-release</a> ipasir)</span> frees the solver object when you are done with 
it.  This is also taken care of by <span class="v">with-local-ipasir</span>.  It requires that 
the solver state not be <span class="v">:undef</span> and it puts it in state <span class="v">:undef</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-ADD-LIT.html">ipasir-add-lit</a> ipasir lit)</span> is the mechanism by which new clauses may 
be added to the formula.  A clause is added by calling this function once for 
each literal in the clause, then calling <span class="v">ipasir-finalize-clause</span>, which 
adds the clause to the formula.  (Literals are represented as natural numbers 
where the LSB indicates negation and the rest is the variable number; see <a href="SATLINK____LITP.html">litp</a>.) Requires that the solver not be in state <span class="v">:undef</span>, and puts the 
solver in state <span class="v">:input</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-FINALIZE-CLAUSE.html">ipasir-finalize-clause</a> ipasir)</span> adds the clause built up by calls of 
<span class="v">ipasir-add-lit</span> to the formula, and empties the clause buffer.  Requires 
that the solver not be in state <span class="v">:undef</span>, and puts the solver in state 
<span class="v">:input</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-ASSUME.html">ipasir-assume</a> ipasir lit)</span> adds a literal to the current assumption 
cube.  Whereas clauses added with <span class="v">ipasir-add-lit</span> are permanent, the assumption 
is emptied each time <span class="v">ipasir-solve</span> is called.  Requires that the solver not 
be in state <span class="v">:undef</span>, and puts the solver in state <span class="v">:input</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-INPUT.html">ipasir-input</a> ipasir)</span> requires that the solver not be in state 
<span class="v">:undef</span> and puts the solver in state <span class="v">:input</span>.  In reality, this is a 
logical fiction that is convenient for functions that normally add some 
literals, clauses, or assumptions but may sometimes not do anything.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-SOLVE.html">ipasir-solve</a> ipasir)</span> determines the satisfiability of the formula 
under the assumption.  It returns <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> status ipasir)</span>, where status is one 
of <span class="v">:unsat</span>, <span class="v">:sat</span>, or <span class="v">:failed</span>.  When it returns <span class="v">:sat</span>, then 
until the next call of <span class="v">ipasir-add-lit</span> or <span class="v">ipasir-assume</span>, the solver can be 
queried with <span class="v">ipasir-val</span> to assess the values of literals under the 
satisfying assignment.  Similarly, when it returns <span class="v">:unsat</span>, then until the 
next call of <span class="v">ipasir-add-lit</span> or <span class="v">ipasir-assume</span> the solver can be queried 
with <span class="v">ipasir-failed</span> to determine whether a given assumption literal was in 
the unsatisfiable core subset of the assumption.  Requires that the solver not 
be in state <span class="v">:undef</span>, and puts the solver in state <span class="v">:sat</span>, <span class="v">:unsat</span>, 
or (when failed) <span class="v">:input).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;@('(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-VAL.html">ipasir-val</a> ipasir lit)</span> determines the value of lit under the current 
satisfying assignment, returning 1 if true, 0 if false, or <span class="v">nil</span> 
if not determined.  Requires that the solver be in state <span class="v">:sat</span> and leaves 
it in that state.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-FAILED.html">ipasir-failed</a> ipasir lit)</span> determines whether lit, which must be a 
member of the assumptions from the previous call of <span class="v">ipasir-solve</span>, was in 
the unsatisfiable core, which is a subset of that assumption under which the 
formula is unsat.  Requires that the solver be in state <span class="v">:unsat</span> and leaves 
it in that state.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-SET-LIMIT.html">ipasir-set-limit</a> ipasir count-or-nil)</span> limits the effort spent by the 
solver.  Logically, all this does is cons something onto the history and reset 
the callback count to 0.  Under the hood, it sets a callback function for the 
solver to call every so often.  If count-or-nil is a positive number, then each 
call of solve may only call the callback that many times before it fails. 
Setting it to nil or 0 removes the limit.  If 0, the callbacks are still 
performed and counted, but will not cause termination.  The frequency with 
which the callback is called varies by solver.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(ipasir-get-status ipasir)</span> simply returns the current status :undef, 
:input, :sat, or :unsat. Mostly used in guards to allow executable guards for 
most of the ipasir functions.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(ipasir-some-history ipasir) (ipasir-empty-new-clause ipasir)
 (ipasir-get-assumption ipasir) (ipasir-solved-assumption ipasir)</span> are 
functions similar in spirit to <span class="v">ipasir-get-status</span> in that they are intended 
to only be used to define executable guards for the ipasir stobj.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-CALLBACK-COUNT.html">ipasir-callback-count</a> ipasir)</span> queries how many times the 
<span class="v">ipasir-set-limit</span> callback has been called since the last initialization or 
call of <span class="v">ipasir-set-limit</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h4>Departures from the C Interface</h4> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Literals are represented as <span class="v">(var &lt;&lt; 1) | neg</span> rather than 
<span class="v">var*(-1^^neg)</span>, for compatibility with other ACL2 libraries such as <a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a> and <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">ACL2::aignet</a>.</li> 
 
<li> <span class="v">ipasir-solve</span> returns a symbol as its status rather than an integer 
code.</li> 
 
<li> <span class="v">ipasir-finalize-clause</span> is used to complete a clause and add it to the 
formula, rather than <span class="v">ipasir-add-lit</span> with literal 0.</li> 
 
<li> <span class="v">ipasir-val</span> returns a bit or NIL rather than a 
literal to indicate the value of the literal in the counterexample.</li> 
 
<li> <span class="v">ipasir-set-limit</span> is used to set resource limitations, replacing the 
callback mechanism of ipasir_set_terminate.</li> 
 
<li> The ACL2 interface does not yet support the API <span class="v">ipasir_set_learn</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h3>Logical story</h3> 
 
<p>There are several problems to solve when trying to soundly model an 
interface with an external library in ACL2.  First, we need a logical 
description of the behavior of the external library that is specific enough to 
be useful, but not so specific that unexpected behaviors produce soundness 
bugs.  Second, we need to restrict user access to functions that break the 
abstraction that allows us to model the external behavior logically.  Third, we 
need to think about possible nondeterminism and how we can rule it out or 
soundly account for it.</p> 
 
<h4>Logical description of behavior</h4> 
 
<p>The logical definitions for the ipasir abstract stobj's interface functions 
are described in terms of a product data structure, <a href="IPASIR____IPASIR_42A.html">ipasir$a</a>. 
The fields of the <span class="v">ipasir$a</span> contain information such as the full 
clausal formula and the current assumption, solver status, and current 
satisfying assignment or unsat core.  The behavior of the interface functions 
above is modeled by updating and retrieving information from these fields. 
However, the <span class="v">ipasir-solve</span> function is special because it is a constrained 
function: we don't know for any given solver state whether it will solve the 
SAT problem or fail due to resource limitations.  We constrain it so that when 
it returns <span class="v">:unsat</span> it implies the formula is unsatisfiable under the 
assumption, and assume certain other behaviors, e.g., it doesn't change the 
formula and it updates the assumption, solution, and status fields 
appropriately.</p> 
 
<h4>Preventing Abstraction Breakage</h4> 
 
<p>The concrete stobj used to introduce the abstract stobj (prior to loading 
the under-the-hood C interface) is a single-field stobj whose one field is 
the (logical) solver object.  The under-the-hood code smashes definitions built 
upon this stobj's accessor/updater.  So if a user were to use this concrete 
stobj, after calling any of these smashed definitions he/she would find that 
the stobj accessor (e.g.) returns some foreign pointer object.  This would be a 
logical problem, so we disallow execution of the accessor and updater for the 
concrete stobj.</p> 
 
<h4>Handling Nondeterminism</h4> 
 
<p>A possible soundness problem with any external tool is that the logical 
model may pretend something is a function which actually isn't.  Calling an 
external SAT solver on the same problem multiple times could yield different 
results even if the solver is correct; e.g., it could produce different 
satisfying assignments.</p> 
 
<p>One way this could occur is by calling <span class="v">ipasir-solve</span> on the same solver 
object twice, without changing the formula and with the same assumptions.  We 
deal with this possibility in the logical story by having every function that 
updates the solver also extend a history field in the solver model, so that you 
can't ever get back to the same solver object on which you already called 
<span class="v">ipasir-solve</span>.</p> 
 
<p>This takes care of multiple calls on the same solver object.  But we could 
also construct two different solvers and run exactly the same series of 
functions on them, and possibly yield different results due to nondeterminism 
in the external library.  To solve this, <span class="v">ipasir-init</span> sets the <span class="v">init</span> 
field of the solver model to the result of reading the ACL2 state's oracle. 
The abstract stobj interface provides no way to access this field so we can't 
know what its value is for any particular instance of the solver, and there's 
no way to provably get the same value from the oracle twice, so this ensures 
there's no way to make two solvers in such a way that they can logically be 
proven to be equal.</p> 
 
<p>This solution is a bit onerous because it means that any function that ever 
uses an ipasir solver has to take and return state.  This can be worked around 
using <span class="v">with-local-state</span> if necessary, at the cost of possible unsoundness 
due to nondeterminism in the external library.  Additionally, 
<span class="v">ipasir-reinit</span> can be used to reinitialize a previously released solver 
without involving state.</p>
