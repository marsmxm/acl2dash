<p>Modifying, Testing, and Debugging</p><font color="#c00000"><p>Before working on changes to ACL2, consider 
 sending email to the acl2-devel list (<span class="v">acl2-devel@utlists.utexas.edu</span>), 
 explaining what you have in mind.  This will avoid duplication and also 
 provide an opportunity for feedback.  In particular, you may want to wait for 
 confirmation from Kaufmann or Moore that at least one of them will be willing 
 to review your patch; otherwise they make no commitment to do so, and your 
 efforts might be wasted!</p></font> 
 
 <p>Please try to limit your modifications to those that are directly related 
 to what you intend to change.  For example, please don't delete comments in a 
 source file or a book.  (If you feel moved to do so, at least first check with 
 an author of the file you propose to change.)  That said, it's certainly it's 
 fine to fix typos.</p> 
 
 <p>Detailed steps for making a contribution are outlined in the topic, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-CONTRIBUTING.html">developers-guide-contributing</a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Development</h3> 
 
 <font color="#c00000"> 
 <p>The first step towards changing ACL2 is typically to create a patch file, 
 which here we call <span class="v">patch.lisp</span>.  It will typically have the following 
 shape.</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <pre class="code">;;; Github commit hash as of your starting ACL2 version (see below)

;;; Comments at the top (perhaps an email thread with a request for the
;;; change)

(<a href="ACL2____REDEF_B2.html">redef+</a>)

&lt;your code&gt;

(<a href="ACL2____REDEF-.html">redef-</a>)
(<a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a>) ; optional</pre> 
 
 <p>The reason to record the github commit hash is so that Kaufmann and Moore 
 can correctly merge in your changes even after there have been several ACL2 
 commits.  You can get that hash by running the following command under the 
 main ACL2 directory.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">git rev-parse HEAD</pre> 
 
 <p>Next, start copying into <span class="v">patch.lisp</span> the source functions that you want 
 to modify.  (As already noted, it is helpful for this process to use 
 <span class="v">meta-.</span> in Emacs.)  It is often best to keep the functions in order: if 
 <span class="v">f</span> calls <span class="v">g</span> and both are defined (or redefined) in <span class="v">patch.lisp</span>, 
 then the definition of <span class="v">g</span> should precede the definition of <span class="v">f</span> in 
 <span class="v">patch.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Now modify those source functions and write any additional supporting 
 functions that you need.  Try to use existing source functions when possible. 
 perhaps finding them by using the Emacs command, <span class="v">meta-x tags-apropos</span>. 
 For example, to find a function that concatenates a list of strings, you could 
 run <span class="v">meta-x tags-apropos append</span> and then search for <span class="v">string</span> in the 
 resulting display; you would find <span class="v">string-append-lst</span>, and you could run 
 the Emacs command <span class="v">meta-.</span> on that word in order to find its definition in 
 the sources, to see if it has the desired functionality.  You may also find it 
 useful to consult the documentation topic, <a href="ACL2____SYSTEM-UTILITIES.html">system-utilities</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>If there are further changes that you wish to make to the ACL2 source code 
 which are not of the form of function definitions or redefinitions — for 
 example, if you want to add or modify a top-level comment, or put some of the 
 new functions in a particular file or a newly created file, etc. — then 
 feel free to add instructions that reflect your intent in comments in 
 <span class="v">patch.lisp</span>, within reason.  We will be reading over <span class="v">patch.lisp</span> 
 manually, so human-directed comments are welcome — the exact format of 
 <span class="v">patch.lisp</span> is not rigid.</p> 
 
 <h3>Initial testing</h3> 
 
 <p>Test your patch by starting ACL2 and evaluating the following form in the 
 loop (but see below for an exception).  The use of <span class="v">:ld-pre-eval-print</span> is 
 optional, but can be helpful when debugging since it prints each form before 
 evaluating it.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> "patch.lisp" :ld-pre-eval-print t)</pre> 
 
 <font color="#c00000"> 
 <p>EXCEPTION: the form above may not work if your patch file has any 
 occurrences of the <span class="v">acl2-loop-only</span> readtime conditional (preceded either 
 by <span class="v">#+</span> or by <span class="v">#-</span>).  In that case, run <span class="v">LP!</span> as follows.  NOTE: if 
 you are making changes that affect definition processing, then you may need to 
 switch the order: first <span class="v">load</span>, then after <span class="v">(LP!)</span>, run <span class="v">ld</span>.</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <pre class="code">:q
(LP!)
(<a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> "patch.lisp" :ld-pre-eval-print t)
:q
(load "patch.lisp") ; only needed if #-acl2-loop-only occurs in patch.lisp
(<a href="ACL2____LP.html">LP</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>Remark (only rarely to be considered).  If efficiency is a concern and you 
 are using a Lisp implementation that does not compile on-the-fly (as of this 
 writing, that includes Lisps other than CCL and SBCL), then put 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-COMPILE-FNS.html">set-compile-fns</a> t)</span> near the top of <span class="v">patch.lisp</span>, and replace <span class="v">(load
 "patch.lisp")</span> just above by the following (perhaps first adding 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")</span> at the top of <span class="v">patch.lisp</span>):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(load "patch.lisp")
(compile-file "patch.lisp")
(load "patch")</pre> 
 
 <p>Now test your patch.  A quick test could be the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(mini-proveall) ; should complete normally
(<a href="ACL2____UBT_12.html">ubt!</a> 1) ; back to just after reset-prehistory was evaluated</pre> 
 
 <p>You might also want to do your own tests.  In some cases, you could even 
 add a book of tests in directory <span class="v">books/system/tests/</span>.  If the change was 
 inspired by problems with a specific event in an existing book, the following 
 can be useful.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> "foo.port")
(<a href="ACL2____REBUILD.html">rebuild</a> "foo.lisp" t)
:ubt &lt;bad-event-name&gt;
&lt;bad-event&gt;</pre> 
 
 <h3>Installing and building</h3> 
 
 <p>When you are satisfied that all is well, take your copy of ACL2 and install 
 the patches: for each system function redefined in patch.lisp, replace the 
 definition in your copy of the ACL2 sources with the redefinition, preceded by 
 new supporting definitions as necessary.  Then in your acl2-sources directory, 
 build the system; see <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-BUILD.html">developers-guide-build</a>.</p> 
 
 <font color="#c00000"> 
 <p>Since ACL2 insists that functions, macros, and constants are introduced 
 before they are referenced, you might need to move some definitions around. 
 You might even need to move then to ``earlier'' files (see <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-BACKGROUND.html">developers-guide-background</a>).  This is normal.  Although a file name like 
 ``<span class="v">rewrite.lisp</span>'' is suggestive of its contents, and ideally the file 
 contains code that reflects the intent of the filename, nevertheless this is 
 not a rule; ACL2 implementors often need to move definitions forward in 
 support of other functions.</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <p>The following two additional steps are occasionally advisable, especially 
 for patches that change definitions that are in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode. 
 Feel free to ask an ACL2 author if they are necessary; as of this writing, 
 that would be Matt Kaufmann, at <span class="v">kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu</span>.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Run ``<span class="v">make proofs</span>''.  That should conclude with the message, 
 ``Initialization SUCCEEDED.''</li> 
 
 <li>Do a ``devel'' build, regression, and check.  See <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS-FOR-SYSTEM-FUNCTIONS.html">verify-guards-for-system-functions</a>, specifically the six steps at the end of 
 the topic.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h3>Regression testing</h3> 
 
 <p>Now do a regression test.  The most complete regression is done using the 
 <span class="v">regression-everything</span> target in the top-level ACL2 sources directory, or 
 equivalently, the <span class="v">everything</span> target in the <span class="v">books/</span> directory.  Please 
 install a SAT solver first; see <a href="SATLINK____SAT-SOLVER-OPTIONS.html">satlink::sat-solver-options</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the ``<span class="v">everything</span>'' level of testing may only work for CCL 
 and SBCL; for other Lisps, or for ACL2(p) or ACL2(r), just use the 
 <span class="v">regression</span> target in the top-level ACL2 sources directory or, 
 equivalently, the <span class="v">all</span> target in the <span class="v">books/</span> directory.  This could 
 take a few hours — perhaps more than 5 hours or even more than 8 hours, 
 depending on the Lisp and the machine.  But feel free to do only an 
 <span class="v">everything</span> regression for ACL2 using CCL or SBCL, ignoring ACL2(p) and 
 ACL2(r).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">make clean-books ; \
(time nice make -j 8 regression-everything) &gt;&amp; make-regression-everything.log&amp;</pre> 
 
 <p>A search for <span class="v">**</span> in the log will determine whether there have been any 
 failures; equivalently, in most cases, a failure has occurred when there is a 
 non-zero exit status.</p> 
 
 <p><font color="#c00000">It is a good idea to keep a record of the time it 
 takes to complete a regression</font> using a given host Lisp and a given 
 value for the <span class="v">-j</span> argument of `<span class="v">make</span>'.  If there is a jump of more 
 than a percent or two that is not attributable to book changes, then perhaps 
 the change is degrading performance.  Of course, that time increase could be 
 noise; we have observed significantly more reliable timings, for example, on 
 Linux than on Mac.  There are wonderful tools <span class="v">books/build/critpath.pl</span> and 
 <span class="v">books/build/compare.pl</span> for narrowing time increases to the level of 
 individual books, which you can investigate interactively, for example using 
 profiling; see <a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ACL2.html">profile-ACL2</a> and <a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ALL.html">profile-all</a>.  (Also, Allegro CL 
 has a particularly nice statistical profiler.)  Here is the first step, to be 
 run in two ACL2 directories, <span class="v">DIR1</span> and <span class="v">DIR2</span>, that you want to compare 
 after having run a regression test in each.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">cd books
find . -name '*.cert.time' -print | sed 's/[.]time$//' | sort &gt; certs.txt
./build/critpath.pl -t certs.txt --write-costs timingfile &gt; timing.txt</pre> 
 
 <p>Then run the following command anywhere, which produces a file 
 <span class="v">compare.txt</span> showing results, sorted two different ways.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">&lt;path_to_acl2&gt;/books/build/compare.pl \
  DIR1/books/timingfile \
  DIR2/books/timingfile &gt; compare.txt</pre> 
 
 <h3>Documentation</h3> 
 
 <font color="#800080"><p>[JUST TOUCH ON THIS SECTION]</p></font> 
 
 <p>Be sure to document your changes.  This will typically involve adding a 
 release note to a topic like <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-2.html">note-8-2</a>.  The XDOC source code 
 documentation for ACL2 resides in the community book 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>.  If the change is not user visible, then 
 a Lisp comment in the corresponding <span class="v">defxdoc</span> form is probably best; the 
 existing <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> note-xxx ...)</span> forms can provide guidance on this. 
 Minor output changes don't generally require any release note.  Be sure to 
 keep the <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> documentation at a user level, not at the level of the 
 implementation.  Note that it is good practice to explain your changes as 
 noted above — that is, in the text or comments of a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a></span> 
 release note form — rather than merely in GitHub commit messages. 
 Every user should be able to find changes documented in the release notes, and 
 every developer should additionally be able to find pertinent Lisp comments; 
 neither will necessarily look back in GitHub logs (some may, but some may 
 not).</p> 
 
 <p>If your changes are related to <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>, consider adding 
 links to topics defined in those books as described in the ``Remark for 
 Experienced Users'' in the documentation topic, <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Also be sure to comment your code well with Lisp comments, at an 
 implementation level.  For example, don't say ``union is commutative'' without 
 explaining that you mean this with respect to set equality, not 
 ordinary (Lisp) equality.</p> 
 
 <p>Whoever actually commits and pushes to github — just Kaufmann and 
 Moore as of this writing, but ideally others in the future — should also 
 synchronize generated ACL2 source file <span class="v">doc.lisp</span> (see <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-BUILD.html">developers-guide-build</a>) with <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>When you add new documentation in community book 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span> for a symbol that is the name of a 
 function, macro, or constant, there is a check in the community book 
 <span class="v">books/misc/check-acl2-exports.lisp</span> that the symbol belongs to the list, 
 <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>.  Rather than add the symbol immediately to that list, 
 however, it may be best to override the check for that symbol, as indicated in 
 the definition of the constant, <span class="v">*acl2-exports-exclusions*</span>, in 
 <span class="v">books/misc/check-acl2-exports.lisp</span>.  The reason for this delay is that if 
 you change <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>, many books may need to be recertified, which 
 could be inconvenient for users.  This issue is documented in the definition 
 of the constant <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2ACL2-EXPORTS_A2.html">*ACL2-exports*</a></span>; see the ``WARNING'' comment there.</p> 
 
 <h3>Debugging</h3> 
 
 <font color="#800080"><p>[JUST TOUCH ON THIS SECTION]</p></font> 
 
 <p>The art of debugging is... an art.  Some tools that can help with debugging 
 are <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_12.html">trace!</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WALKABOUT.html">walkabout</a></span>, <a href="ACL2____IPRINTING.html">iprinting</a>, and (rarely) <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISASSEMBLE_42.html">disassemble$</a></span>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____DEBUGGING.html">debugging</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A common way to debug an unexpected error is to invoke 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a> t)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a>)</span>.  This may put you in 
 the debugger when there is an error.  Each host Lisp has its own debugger 
 commands for looking at the backtrace; for example, in CCL the command is 
 <span class="v">:b</span>, while in SBCL it is <span class="v">backtrace</span>.  CCL's debugger lets you easily 
 explore individual forms in the backtrace.  <font color="#c00000">Here is an 
 edited log showing how that works.</font></p>

 <p>Some problems are, of course, more awkward to debug.  One that pops up from 
 time to time is an error like this.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">&gt; Error: value NIL is not of the expected type NUMBER.
&gt; While executing: CCL::+-2, in process listener(1).</pre> 
 
 <p>That particular sort of error may indicate that the <span class="v">state</span> argument of 
 some function was passed incorrectly, perhaps in the wrong argument 
 position.</p> 
 
 <p>In rare cases an error may occur for which the backtrace isn't helpful or 
 even makes little sense.  Something to try is to build with safety 3, for 
 example as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">make ACL2_SAFETY=3 PREFIX=safety-3-</pre> 
 
 <p>If your test case involves including books, then also clean the books or 
 use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-COMPILER-ENABLED.html">set-compiler-enabled</a></span> to avoid loading their compiled files.  Then 
 try again with the new executable; of course, if you cleaned the books, then 
 first recertify as appropriate using the new executable.  ACL2 will run more 
 slowly, but in return it will do a lot more checking along the way and might 
 well provide a much better backtrace than before.</p> 
 
 <p>If you are reading this and have more debugging suggestions, by all means 
 consider adding them here!</p> 
 
 <h3>Finishing up</h3> 
 
 <p>Now feel free to send all changed files and also the starting git commit 
 hash (or even the entire patch file, too) for review, to whoever has offered 
 to look at your patch!  Some day others besides Kaufmann and Moore may be 
 authorized to commit and push source code changes directly to GitHub; but 
 getting someone else to review the changes could still be a good thing to 
 do.</p> 
 
 <p>When you are ready to have your patch incorporated into ACL2, follow the 
 detailed steps for making a contribution outlined in the topic, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-CONTRIBUTING.html">developers-guide-contributing</a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>General guidance</h3> 
 
 <p>We close this chapter with some relevant tips and observations, some of 
 which may also be found elsewhere in this Guide.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<font color="#c00000">Small examples help when testing new features or bug fixes.</font>  For a bug fix 
 it is important to have an example that exhibits the bug, both to guarantee 
 that there really is a problem and to use to test your patch.  Ideally the 
 example will be small, as this is useful for reading the output from tracing 
 functions or debugger backtraces, and small examples are often helpful for 
 understanding the problem.  Consider adding one or more relevant tests to 
 <span class="v">books/system/tests/</span> or perhaps, if appropriate, <span class="v">books/demos/</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<font color="#c00000">Often it is best to avoid making a more sweeping change than necessary, 
 instead waiting for users to complain.</font>  This process has several advantages: 
 it avoids needless code complications; the user's complaint may help to inform 
 the nature of the additional changes; and it may take significantly less time 
 to complete the implementation, especially if there is a simple fix that is 
 clearly correct and solves the problem.</li> 
 
 <li>
<font color="#c00000">Look for precedents</font>, since new code is probably more likely to be correct 
 to the extent it is analogous to existing code.  ACL2 is a complex system with 
 invariants that are not always explicit, so to the extent that you can follow 
 the existing implementation of some feature, you may avoid introducing bugs or 
 undesirable behavior.  For example, if you want to add a new key to the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, find an existing such key and do a tags-search for it, 
 and mimic the implementation of that existing key to the extent it makes 
 sense.  Try to pick a key that is little-used, so that the tags-search mainly 
 hits on the essential aspects of being a key in the <span class="v">acl2-defaults-table</span>. 
 For another example: to arrange for adding <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYSTEM-ATTACHMENTS.html">system-attachments</a></span> to the 
 <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>, the process was to follow how <span class="v">hint-events</span> is put into the 
 summary, so a first step was to do tags-search for ``<span class="v">hint-events</span>''.</li> 
 
 <li>At what point during the development of a source code change is it best to 
 write comments and user-level documentation?  It may be good to write an 
 outline before coding, as a guide towards what you want.  But ACL2 
 implementation work can be tricky, which may lead you to change the 
 specification slightly; so it is probably best to leave detailed documentation 
 until after the other work is done, including testing.</li> 
 
 <li>
<font color="#c00000">Expect to take considerable time writing comments, 
 documentation, and output (e.g., for warnings and errors).</font> These are 
 important and may take longer than the implementation work itself.</li> 
 
 </ul>
