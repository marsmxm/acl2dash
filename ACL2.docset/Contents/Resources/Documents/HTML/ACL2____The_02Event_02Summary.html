<p>The Event Summary</p><p>At the conclusion of most events (click <a href="ACL2____About_02the_02Prompt.html">here</a> for a brief discussion of events or 
 see <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>), ACL2 prints a summary.  The summary for <span class="v">app</span> 
 is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Summary
Form:  ( DEFUN APP ...)
Rules: ((:FAKE-RUNE-FOR-TYPE-SET NIL))
Warnings:  None
Time:  0.03 seconds (prove: 0.00, print: 0.00, other: 0.03)
 APP</pre> 
 
 <p>The ``rules'' listed are those used in function admission or proof 
 summarized.  What is actually listed are ``runes'' (see <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>) <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>) 
 which are list-structured names for rules in the ACL2 database or ``<a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>'' <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.  Using <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> you 
 can ``enable'' and ``disable'' rules so as to make them available (or not) to 
 the ACL2 theorem prover.</p> 
 
 <p>The ``warnings'' mentioned (none are listed for <span class="v">app</span>) remind the reader 
 whether the event provoked any warnings.  The warnings themselves would have 
 been printed earlier in the processing and this part of the summary just names 
 the earlier warnings printed.</p> 
 
 <p>The ``time'' indicates how much processing time was used and is divided 
 into three parts: the time devoted to proof, to printing, and to syntactic 
 checks, pre-processing and database updates.  Despite the fact that ACL2 is an 
 applicative language it is possible to measure time with ACL2 programs.  The 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> contains a clock.  The times are printed in decimal 
 notation but are actually counted in integral units.  Note that by default, 
 each time is a runtime, also known as a cpu time, as opposed to being a real 
 time, also known as a wall clock time.</p> 
 
 <p>The final <span class="v">APP</span> is the value of the <span class="v">defun</span> command and was printed 
 by the read-eval-print loop.  The fact that it is indented one space is a 
 subtle reminder that the command actually returned an ``error triple'', 
 consisting of a flag indicating (in this case) that no error occurred, a value 
 (in this case the symbol <span class="v">APP</span>), and the final <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>).
