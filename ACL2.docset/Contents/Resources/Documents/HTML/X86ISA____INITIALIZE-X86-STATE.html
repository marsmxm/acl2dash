<p>Initializing the x86 state for concrete program execution</p><p>The utilities in this section are meant to be used to 
 initialize the x86 state when doing concrete execution or when 
 bit-blasting using GL.  These are not intended for doing proofs using 
 rewriting.  For utilities that help in code proofs, see the libraries 
 in directory <span class="v">x86isa/proofs/utilities</span>.</p>
