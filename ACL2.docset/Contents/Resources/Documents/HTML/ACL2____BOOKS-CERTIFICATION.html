<p>Instructions for certifying the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>.</p><p>The <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">Community Books</a> 
provides a <span class="v">make</span> system, which is recommended for certifying a specified 
subset of those books from the <span class="v">books/</span> directory of your ACL2 distribution. 
Alternate instructions are however available for certifying from the top-level 
directory (see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION-ALT.html">books-certification-alt</a>).</p> 
 
<p>Below are instructions for certifying various sets of books.  They all have 
the following form in common.  Note: If there is a suitable <span class="v">"acl2"</span> 
executable on your Unix <span class="v">PATH</span>  for example, if the <span class="v">bin</span> 
subdirectory of the main ACL2 directory is on your <span class="v">PATH</span>, so that 
<span class="v">bin/acl2</span> may be your executable  then you can omit 
<span class="v">"ACL2=..."</span> below.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">cd /path/to/acl2-sources/books
make ACL2=/path/to/acl2-sources/saved_acl2 ...</pre> 
 
<p>For example, the section ``A Full Build'', below, says to do the following 
if you would like to make a change to the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> (where the 
<span class="v">-j</span> argument is optional).</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cd /path/to/acl2-sources/books
$ make ACL2=/path/to/acl2-sources/saved_acl2 -j 2 all</pre> 
 
<p>Success is indicated by a Linux exit status of 0.  Equivalently, there 
should be no failures in the log.  Failures may be found by searching for 
<span class="v">**</span>; for example, if output is redirected to a log file 
<span class="v">make-regression.log</span>, then the following should provide no output.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">fgrep -a '**' make-regression.log</pre> 
 
<p>Unusual books that create output in the log file should not produce the 
string <span class="v">**</span> except upon failure.</p> 
 
<p>By default, <span class="v">make</span> commands for certifying books take advantage of files 
<span class="v">*@useless-runes.lsp</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____USELESS-RUNES.html">useless-runes</a>.</p> 
 
<h3>Prerequisites</h3> 
 
<p>We assume that you have already downloaded and installed ACL2 as per the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-4/HTML/installation/installation.html" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2 installation instructions<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-4/HTML/installation/installation.html"></nobr></a> on 
the ACL2 home page.</p> 
 
<p>We assume you know the path to your ACL2 executable.  Typically this is a 
script named <span class="v">saved_acl2</span> in your <span class="v">acl2-sources</span> directory.</p> 
 
<p>We assume the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> are installed in the <span class="v">books/</span> 
subdirectory of your ACL2 distribution, as is the case when you have followed 
the ACL2 installation instructions above.</p> 
 
<p>The instructions below are suitable for ACL2 and all of its experimental 
extensions, e.g., ACL2(p) and ACL2(r).</p> 
 
<p>It may be preferable to avoid being logged in as root, since developers do 
not test as root and at least one community book 
(<span class="v">books/oslib/tests/copy.lisp</span>) has failed to certify when logged in as 
root.</p> 
 
<h3>A Basic Build</h3> 
 
<p>Before ACL2 Version 6.4, building the Community Books could take several 
hours.  Now, the default <span class="v">make</span> target in <span class="v">books/GNUmakefile</span>, called 
<span class="v">basic</span>, is much faster  it excludes many books and certifies only 
books listed below, which tend to be widely used.  <b>WARNING</b>: the 
<span class="v">basic</span> target of <span class="v">books/GNUmakefile</span> is insufficient for validating 
changes that will go into the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>; for that, use the 
<span class="v">all</span> target.</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>arithmetic</li> 
<li>arithmetic-3</li> 
<li>arithmetic-5</li> 
<li><a href="ACL2____IHS.html">ihs</a></li> 
<li>misc</li> 
<li>tools</li> 
<li><a href="ACL2____STD.html">std</a></li> 
<li><a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a></li> 
<li>data-structures</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>To certify these books, you should be able to run <span class="v">make</span> as follows.  The 
<span class="v">-j 2</span> part of this command is suitable for a computer with two cores.  If 
you have, e.g., a quad-core computer, you should probably use <span class="v">-j 4</span> 
instead, and so on.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cd /path/to/acl2-sources/books
$ make ACL2=/path/to/acl2-sources/saved_acl2 -j 2 basic</pre> 
 
<p>If you configure your <span class="v">PATH</span> so that you can launch ACL2 by typing 
<span class="v">acl2</span>, then you may omit the <span class="v">ACL2=...</span> part.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Certifying Additional Books</h3> 
 
<p>We expect that most ACL2 users will want to certify at least the <span class="v">basic</span> 
books described above.  But what if you also need other books?  One option is 
to do a full build (see below).  But it is usually <b>much faster</b> to simply 
tell <span class="v">make</span> to build the books you actually want to use.</p> 
 
<p>There are <span class="v">make</span> targets corresponding to most directory names.  For 
instance, to build the books under <span class="v">coi</span> and <span class="v">rtl</span> and <span class="v">cgen</span>, you can 
run:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cd /path/to/acl2-sources/books
$ make ACL2=/path/to/acl2-sources/saved_acl2 coi rtl cgen -j 2</pre> 
 
<p>For finer grained control, you can name individual books.  This works 
particularly well for libraries that have <span class="v">top</span> books.  For instance, if you 
want the <span class="v">rtl/rel9</span> library, you could run:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cd /path/to/acl2-sources/books
$ make ACL2=/path/to/acl2-sources/saved_acl2 rtl/rel9/lib/top.cert -j 2</pre> 
 
 
<h3>Books that Require ACL2 Extensions</h3> 
 
<p>Some books require experimental extensions to ACL2, such as ACL2(p) (see 
<a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>) or ACL2(r) (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>).  Other books require certain 
additional software.</p> 
 
<p>The build system will automatically determine which kind of ACL2 you are 
running (ACL2, ACL2(p), or ACL2(r)) and, based on this, may prevent 
incompatible books from being certified.  The output of <span class="v">make</span> should 
explain which books are being excluded and why.</p> 
 
<p>These kinds of book requirements are controlled by special <a href="BUILD____CERT_F5PARAM.html">build::cert_param</a> comments.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Books that Require Quicklisp</h3> 
 
<p>Some books, especially <a href="ACL2____INTERFACING-TOOLS.html">interfacing-tools</a> like <a href="ACL2____OSLIB.html">oslib</a> and the 
ACL2 <a href="ACL2____BRIDGE.html">bridge</a>, require certain Common Lisp libraries.</p> 
 
<p>These libraries are now bundled with ACL2 via <a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">quicklisp</a>, so you 
should not need to download anything extra to use them.  They are enabled by 
default for all host Lisps except GCL, but you can avoid books that depend on 
Quicklisp libraries by setting <span class="v">USE_QUICKLISP=0</span> in your 
<span class="v">make</span> command.</p> 
 
<p>Using Quicklisp should definitely work if the host Lisp is CCL or SBCL. 
There is some chance it will work with Allegro CL, LispWorks, and CMUCL.  It 
will almost certainly <b>not</b> work for GCL (at least as of 2018).</p> 
 
 
<h3>Books that Require Additional Software</h3> 
 
<p>Some other books based on <a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a> and <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> require a SAT solver, 
typically Glucose, to be installed; see <a href="SATLINK____SAT-SOLVER-OPTIONS.html">satlink::sat-solver-options</a> for 
installation options.  The build system should automatically determine if 
Glucose is installed on your system, and will avoid trying to certify these 
books unless Glucose is present.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Building the manual</h3> 
 
<p>If you just want to get a copy of the ACL2+Books manual for local viewing, 
you probably <b>don't need to build it yourself</b> because you can just <a href="download/" target="_blank"><nobr>download<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to download/"></nobr></a> a copy.  If for some reason you do want to build 
the manual yourself, you should be able to do so as follows, provided you have 
installed glucose.  (That requirement might be eliminated in the future.)</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cd /path/to/acl2-sources/books
$ make manual -j 4</pre> 
 
<p>Building the manual should work on at least CCL and SBCL on Linux and Mac OS 
X.  It <b>may not work</b> for some other OS/Lisp combinations.  In particular, 
building the manual requires some features from <a href="ACL2____OSLIB.html">oslib</a> and <a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">quicklisp</a> that may not be available on some other Lisps.</p> 
 
<p>The resulting web-based manual may be found in:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">acl2-sources/books/doc/manual/index.html</pre> 
 
<p>See also <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> for details about how to build your own 
Emacs-based manual, and <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">xdoc::save</a> for general information about how to 
build and distribute custom XDOC manuals, e.g., manuals that additionally 
include your own unreleased books.</p> 
 
 
<h3>A Full Build</h3> 
 
<p>Building all of the books can take hours and is <b>usually unnecessary</b>. 
That said, it is easy to do: just run <span class="v">make all</span>, for example as follows. 
(But as noted above, you may omit <span class="v">"ACL2=..."</span> if a suitable executable 
named <span class="v">acl2</span> is on your Unix <span class="v">PATH</span>, such as <span class="v">bin/acl2</span>.)</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cd /path/to/acl2-sources/books
$ make ACL2=/path/to/acl2-sources/saved_acl2 -j 2 all</pre> 
 
<p>This includes a few books that are quite slow to certify.  You can 
exclude those by replacing ``<span class="v">all</span>'' by ``<span class="v">regression</span>'' in the 
command above.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Cleaning Up</h3> 
 
<p>If you want to delete generated files, you can run <span class="v">make clean</span> to remove 
certificates, compiled files, and build logs.</p> 
 
<p>If you just want to remove the files in a particular subdirectory (and its 
subdirectories), you can go into that directory and then run the 
<span class="v">build/clean.pl</span> script.  This will delete, starting from your current 
directory, recursively, all certificates, logs, compiled files, etc.</p> 
 
<p>Note that <span class="v">make clean</span> doesn't remove some files, e.g., <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> 
manuals.  To remove everything, try <span class="v">make moreclean</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Debugging Failed Certifications</h3> 
 
<p>If a book fails to certify, you may want to try certifying it in an 
interactive session.  The most reliable way to do this is to replicate the 
environment and commands that the build system used.  This information can be 
found at the top of the <span class="v">[bookname].cert.out</span> file.  For instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">;; foo.cert.out
-*- Mode: auto-revert -*-
...
Environment variables:
ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION=NONE                 ;; &lt;-- first configure your
ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS=/path/to/acl2/books   ;;     environment to match
ACL2=/path/to/saved_acl2                ;;     these settings
...
Temp lisp file:
(<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">acl2::value</a> :q)                 ;; &lt;--- then submit these commands to
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">acl2::in-package</a> "ACL2")      ;;      $ACL2 to debug the failure
...                              ;;      interactively
--- End temp lisp file ---</pre> 
 
<p>Some other notes/tips:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Make sure the ACL2 image you run is the same as the one listed as ACL2 in 
those environment variables!</li> 
 
<li>You may wish to set the environment variables for only the duration of your 
ACL2 session by using the "env" command.</li> 
 
<li>You may wish to edit some of the commands for better debugging purposes; 
e.g. you may modify the <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a> command, or insert a 
<a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a> command, etc.</li> 
 
<li>If you don't want your session to exit after a successful certification, 
replace the last form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ER-PROGN.html">er-progn</a> (<a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a> (<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> ...</span> with just the 
<span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a> (<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> ...))</span> part.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h3>Further Resources</h3> 
 
<p>The build system is largely based on <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a>.  There is 
considerable documentation about <span class="v">cert.pl</span>, and we highly recommend using it 
to manage your own ACL2 projects.</p> 
 
<p>The main build script is <span class="v">books/GNUmakefile</span>.  There are many comments at 
the start of this file, and you can also inspect it to see what targets are 
available.</p> 
 
<p>Please feel absolutely free to contact the <a href="ACL2____ACL2-HELP.html">ACL2-help</a> mailing list 
with any questions about building the community books.</p>
