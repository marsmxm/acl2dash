  <p>The general form is: 
  <pre class="code">with-timeout duration body timeout-form</pre> 
  </p> 
 
  <p> 
  <span class="v">duration</span> can be any rational value.  A duration of 0 seconds disables 
  the timeout mechanism, i.e its a no-op. Suppose it is not, and <span class="v">duration</span> 
  seconds elapse during evaluation of <span class="tt">body</span> then the evaluation is aborted 
  and the value of <span class="v">timeout-form</span> is returned; in the normal case the value 
  of <span class="tt">body</span> is returned. 
  </p> 
  <p> The signature of <span class="tt">body</span> and <span class="tt">timeout-form</span> should be the same.  </p> 
 
  <h3>Advanced Notes:</h3> 
  <p> 
  This form should be called either at the top-level or in 
  an environment where state is available and <span class="tt">body</span> has 
  no free variables other than state. 
  If the timeout-form is a long running computation, 
  then the purpose of with-timeout is defeated.
