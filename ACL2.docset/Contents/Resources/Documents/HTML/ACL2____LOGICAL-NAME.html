<p>A name created by a logical event</p><pre class="code">Examples:
assoc
caddr
+
"ACL2-USER"
"arith"
"project/task-1/arith.lisp"
:here</pre> 
 
 <p>A logical name is either a name introduced by some event, such as <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, or else is the keyword 
 <span class="v">:here</span>, which refers to the most recent such event.  See <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>. 
 Every logical name is either a symbol or a string.  For the syntactic rules on 
 names, see <a href="ACL2____NAME.html">name</a>.  The symbols name functions, macros, constants, 
 axioms, theorems, labels, and <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>.  The strings name packages or 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  We permit the keyword symbol <span class="v">:here</span> to be used as a logical 
 name denoting the most recently completed event.</p> 
 
 <p>The logical name introduced by an <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> is the full book name 
 string for the book (see <a href="ACL2____FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a>).  Thus, under the appropriate 
 setting for the current book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>) the event 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "arith")</span> may introduce the logical name</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp" .</pre> 
 
 <p>Under a different <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a></span> setting, it may introduce a different logical 
 name, perhaps</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">"/local/src/acl2/library/arith.lisp" .</pre> 
 
 <p>It is possible that identical <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> events forms in a 
 session introduce two different logical names because of the current book 
 directory.</p> 
 
 <p>A logical name that is a string is either a package name or a book name. 
 If it is not a package name, we support various conventions to interpret it as 
 a book name.  If it does not end with the string <span class="v">".lisp"</span> we extend it 
 appropriately.  Then, we search for any book name that has the given logical 
 name as a terminal substring.  Suppose <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "arith")</span> is the 
 only <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> so far and that 
 <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp"</span> is the source file it 
 processed.  Then <span class="v">"arith"</span>, <span class="v">"arith.lisp"</span> and 
 <span class="v">"task-1/arith.lisp"</span> are all logical names identifying that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event (unless they are package names).  Now suppose a second 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "arith")</span> is executed and processes 
 <span class="v">"/local/src/acl2/library/arith.lisp"</span>.  Then <span class="v">"arith"</span> is no longer 
 a logical name, because it is ambiguous.  However, <span class="v">"task-1/arith"</span> is a 
 logical name for the first <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> and <span class="v">"library/arith"</span> is 
 a logical name for the second.  Indeed, the first can be named by 
 <span class="v">"1/arith"</span> and the second by <span class="v">"y/arith"</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Logical names are used primarily in the theory manipulation functions, 
 e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNIVERSAL-THEORY.html">universal-theory</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a></span> with which you may 
 obtain some standard <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a> as of some point in the historical past. 
 The reference points are the introductions of logical names, i.e., the past is 
 determined by the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> it contains.  One might ask, ``Why not discuss 
 the past with the much more flexible language of <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptors?'' 
 (See <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.)  The reason is that inside of such <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> or macro <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s that expand to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span>s of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptors provide too coarse a 
 grain.</p> 
 
 <p>When logical names are used as referents in theory expressions used in 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>, one must consider the possibility that the defining event within 
 the book in question becomes redundant by the definition of the name prior to 
 the assumption of the book.  See <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>.</p>
