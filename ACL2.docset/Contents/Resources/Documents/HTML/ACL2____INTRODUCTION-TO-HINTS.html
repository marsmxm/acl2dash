<p>How to provide hints to the theorem prover</p><p>We assume you've read <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-REWRITE-RULES-PART-1.html">introduction-to-rewrite-rules-part-1</a>, 
 <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-KEY-CHECKPOINTS.html">introduction-to-key-checkpoints</a>, and <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-DATABASE.html">introduction-to-the-database</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>You may give the theorem prover a hint that is specific to a particular 
 subgoal generated during a proof attempt.  Of course, you learn the name of 
 the subgoal by inspecting the key checkpoints or other proof output.  You are 
 not expected to anticipate the need for hints at specific subgoals; instead, 
 you usually deduce that a hint is required because the subgoals is not proved 
 but you see that existing rules and context make it provable.</p> 
 
 <p>The most common hint is to enable and/or disable a particular rule on some 
 particular subgoal.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defthm <i>name</i> 
        <i>formula</i> 
        :hints (("Subgoal *1/3.2''" :in-theory (disable nth-nthcdr)))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The hint above tells the rewriter that just before it begins to work on 
 <span class="v">Subgoal *1/3.2''</span> it should switch to a local theory in which all of the 
 rules generated from the event <span class="v">nth-nthcdr</span> are disabled.  That local 
 theory remains the one in use for all descendant subgoals generated from the 
 one named, until and unless one of those descendant subgoals has an 
 <span class="v">:in-theory</span> hint associated with it.  There are many kinds of hints 
 besides <span class="v">:in-theory</span> and in general, after each subgoal name, you can give 
 various forms of advice and list various adjustments you wish to make to the 
 context in which the prover is operating when it begins addressing the subgoal 
 named.</p> 
 
 <p>The top-level goal is always named <span class="v">Goal</span>.  Thus</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defthm <i>name</i> 
        <i>formula</i> 
        :hints (("Goal" ...<i>hints1</i>...) 
                ("Subgoal *1/3.2''" ...<i>hints2</i>...))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>has the effect of using <i>hints1</i> for the top-level goal and all of its 
 children throughout the entire proof, except for <span class="v">Subgoal *1/3.2''</span> and its 
 children, where <i>hints2</i> is used instead.</p> 
 
 <p>There are a few hints which ``take effect'' exactly on the subgoal to which 
 they are attached and are not inherited by their descendents.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is an incomplete list of some of the more common hints; we note the 
 ones that do not pass on their effects to their descendants.  We recommend 
 that you not follow the advanced links (marked ``<a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>'') 
 below until you have read the entire tutorial.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> for how to enable and/or disable rules.  The new 
 theory is computed by a ``theory expression'' (see <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>) 
 such as <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> nth-nthcdr)</span> and typically makes adjustments such as 
 additions or deletions to the global current theory.  All the relevant new 
 theories are computed before the proof begins.  Thus, in</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defthm <i>name</i> 
        <i>formula</i> 
        :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (disable rule1)) 
                ("Subgoal *1/3.2''" (disable rule2)))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>the theory mentioned for <span class="v">Goal</span> is the global current theory minus 
 <span class="v">rule1</span>, while the theory mentioned for its descendant, <span class="v">Subgoal
 *1/3.2''</span>, is the global current theory minus <span class="v">rule2</span>.  In particular, if 
 both <span class="v">rule1</span> and <span class="v">rule2</span> are enabled in the global current theory, then 
 <span class="v">rule1</span> is enabled during the processing of <span class="v">Subgoal *1/3.2''</span> because 
 it was not removed explicitly there.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____USE.html">use</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> for how to force the theorem prover to 
 take note of particular instances of particular theorems; in particular, the 
 instances are created and added as hypotheses to the subgoal in question.  The 
 hint is not inherited by the descendants of the subgoal (since the formula 
 being proved has been modified by the hint).  If the rule you are using (with 
 a <span class="v">:use</span> hint) is an enabled rewrite rule, it might interfere with the 
 added hypothesis — by rewriting itself to <span class="v">T</span> — and thus often 
 you will both <span class="v">:use ...</span>  and <span class="v">:in-theory (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> ...)</span>.</p>

 split to prove the subgoal under each of an exhaustive list of cases given in 
 the hint.  This hint takes action specifically at the named subgoal and is not 
 passed down to its children.</p>

 immediately into induction for the subgoal in question, and to use the 
 induction scheme suggested by the hint rather than the one suggested by the 
 terms in the subgoal itself.  This hint is not inherited by its 
 descendents.</p>
