<p>Characters with additional annotations.</p><p>Our lexer (and preprocessor) operate on lists of "extended 
characters", which associate regular characterp objects with their origin in 
the Verilog source code.</p> 
 
<p>We represent these origins using <a href="VL2014____VL-LOCATION-P.html">vl-location-p</a> structures, which 
simply have a file name, line number, and column number.  We represent each 
extended character as an <a href="VL2014____VL-ECHAR-P.html">vl-echar-p</a>, a structure that associates a 
character with its location.</p>
