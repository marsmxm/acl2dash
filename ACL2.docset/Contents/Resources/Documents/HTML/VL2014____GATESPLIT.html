<p>Split up gates with "extra" terminals.</p><h3>Gate Splitting</h3> 
 
<p>This transformation is responsible for splitting up multi-input gates into 
multiple one-input gates for <span class="v">buf</span> and <span class="v">not</span>, or two-input gates for 
<span class="v">and</span>, <span class="v">or</span>, etc.  It also deals with degenerate cases like single-input 
<span class="v">and</span> gates, which are not ruled out by the Verilog specification.</p> 
 
<p><b>Ordering Notes.</b> This transformation must be done after widths have 
been computed, and after <a href="VL2014____REPLICATE-INSTS.html">replicate-insts</a> has been run to eliminate any 
arrays.  Replication is necessary for certain well-formedness checks on the 
widths to succeed.</p> 
 
<p>Unlike occforming, we lay down gates directly instead of introducing new 
modules.  It might be nicer to do it the other way and introduce modules 
instead, since then the module instance could keep the same name as the gate. 
On the other hand, the code to just introduce gates is simpler, and it would 
probably suffice to just use good names or annotations to explain where the 
gates come from.</p>
