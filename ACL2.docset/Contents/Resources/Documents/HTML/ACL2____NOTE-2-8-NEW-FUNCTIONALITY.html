<p>ACL2 Version  2.8 Notes on New Functionality</p><p>WARNING: You may find that <span class="v">control-d</span> (in emacs, <span class="v">control-c
 control-d</span>) can throw you completely out of Lisp where it had not formerly 
 done so.</p> 
 
 <p>(CLISP and Allegro CL only) ACL2 now starts up inside the ACL2 loop — 
 that is, <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span><span class="v">)</span> is executed automatically — when built 
 on CLISP or Allegro CL.  This was already the case for GCL and CMUCL, and it 
 still is not true for LispWorks.  Thanks to Joe Corneli for bringing the CLISP 
 command-line option <span class="v">"-i"</span> to our attention, which led to this CLISP 
 change and inspired reconsideration of how to do this for Allegro CL.</p> 
 
 <p>Pete Manolios and Daron Vroon have changed the representation of ordinals 
 in ACL2, defined algorithms for ordinal arithmetic, and created a library of 
 theorems to reason about ordinal arithmetic.  We thank them for these nice 
 contributions.  See <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-8-ORDINALS.html">note-2-8-ordinals</a> for details, in particular, for 
 how to preserve existing proofs that depend on the previous ordinal 
 representation.</p> 
 
 <p>Sometimes users create rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> that cause an 
 infinite loop in the ACL2 rewriter.  This has lead to Lisp stack overflows and 
 even segmentation faults.  Now, the depth of calls of functions in the ACL2 
 rewriter is limited, and under user control.  See <a href="ACL2____REWRITE-STACK-LIMIT.html">rewrite-stack-limit</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Macros <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> (``must be equal'') and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBT.html">mbt</a></span> (``must be true'') 
 have been introduced, which allow the user to attach fast executable 
 definitions to (presumably slower) <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode functions.  Thanks 
 to Vernon Austel for a key idea.  Also provided is a macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEXEC.html">defexec</a></span>, 
 which employs <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> but enforces the requirement that the executable 
 definition also terminates.  Thanks to Jose Luis Ruiz Reina for collaborating 
 in the design and development of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEXEC.html">defexec</a></span>, and for useful comments from 
 a number of others as well in the development of <span class="v">mbe</span> including Joe 
 Hendrix and Rob Sumners.</p> 
 
 <p>Definitions have been added for functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RASSOC-EQ.html">rassoc-eq</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RASSOC-EQUAL.html">rassoc-equal</a></span>, which are like <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____RASSOC.html">rassoc</a></span> but use different tests and have 
 different guards.  (Compare <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQ.html">assoc-eq</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a></span>, which 
 are in similar relation to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ASSOC.html">assoc</a></span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>The user can now control multiple matching for free variables in hypotheses 
 for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> rules, as has already been supported for 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rules.  For 
 <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> rules, ``free variables'' are those in the hypotheses 
 not bound by a given trigger term.  As for <span class="v">:rewrite</span> and <span class="v">:linear</span> 
 rules, free-variable matching may be limited to the first successful attempt 
 by specifying <span class="v">:match-free :once</span> with <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> in the 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a></span> may be used to 
 modify the behavior of an existing rule.  Thanks to Erik Reeber for most of 
 the implementation of these new capabilities, as well as significant 
 assistance with a corresponding new documentation topic (see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES-EXAMPLES-FORWARD-CHAINING.html">free-variables-examples-forward-chaining</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>It is no longer necessary to specify <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-ERROR.html">set-match-free-error</a> nil)</span> in 
 order to avoid errors when a rule with free variables in its hypotheses is 
 missing the <span class="v">:match-free</span> field.  (This was already true during book 
 certification, but now it is the case in interactive sessions as well.)</p> 
 
 <p>The form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a>)</span> causes, at least for most Lisps, entry into 
 the Lisp debugger whenever ACL2 causes an error.  See <a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a>. 
 Thanks to John Erickson for providing encouragement to provide this 
 feature.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span> has been provided so that advanced users can override 
 the built-in <span class="v">untranslate</span> functionality.  See <a href="ACL2____USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS-TABLE.html">user-defined-functions-table</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a></span> mechanism (formerly denoted <span class="v">checkpoints</span>) has been 
 improved.  The ``process [prover] stack,'' or pstack, is automatically printed 
 when proofs abort.  Evaluation of function calls on explicit arguments during 
 proofs is now tracked.  Actual parameters are shown with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a> t)</span> 
 rather than formals.  Thanks to Bill Legato for suggesting the first two of 
 these improvements and, in general, encouraging changes that make ACL2 easier 
 to use.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> event is now allowed to take an <span class="v">:inline</span> argument, 
 which can speed up execution.  Thanks to Rob Sumners for suggesting and 
 implementing this new feature.</p> 
 
 <p>Macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSERT_42.html">assert$</a></span> has been added in order to make it easy to write 
 assertions in one's code.  Semantically, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSERT_42.html">assert$</a> test form)</span> is the same 
 as <span class="v">form</span>, but it causes a hard error (using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ILLEGAL.html">illegal</a></span>) if <span class="v">test</span> 
 evaluates to <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW-GSTACK.html">cw-gstack</a></span> no longer takes arguments for the gstack or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.  However, it now takes a keyword argument (which is optional), 
 <span class="v">:evisc-tuple</span>, that can be used to control how it prints terms.  In 
 particular, <span class="v">cw-gstack</span> abbreviates large terms by default, but 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CW-GSTACK.html">cw-gstack</a> :evisc-tuple nil)</span> causes terms to be printed in full.  Thanks 
 to Robert Krug and Eric Smith for requesting this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>The advanced user now has more control over the evisceration of terms.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____LD-EVISC-TUPLE.html">ld-evisc-tuple</a>, in particular the new paragraph on ``The printing of 
 error messages and warnings.''</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event now has an additional (optional) keyword, 
 <span class="v">:dir</span>.  The value of <span class="v">:dir</span> should be a keyword that is associated with 
 an absolute directory pathname to be used in place of the current book 
 directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>) for resolving the first argument of 
 <span class="v">include-book</span> to an absolute pathname.  At start-up, the only such keyword 
 is <span class="v">:system</span>, so that for example <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "arithmetic/top" :dir
 :system)</span> will include the book <span class="v">"arithmetic/top"</span> under the 
 <span class="v">"books/"</span> directory of your ACL2 installation.  But you can associate 
 ``projects'' with keywords using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a></span>, e.g., 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a> :my-project "/u/smith/project0/")</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a> and also see <a href="ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">delete-include-book-dir</a> and see 
 <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>.  Note: You will probably not find <span class="v">:dir :system</span> to be 
 useful if the distributed books are not placed in the path of their original 
 location, pointed to by <span class="v">:dir :system</span>, which will often happen if the 
 executable image is obtained from another site.  Also see <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>, 
 in particular its ``soundness warning''.</p> 
 
 <p>The printing of results in raw mode (see <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a>) may now be 
 partially controlled by the user: see <span class="v">add-raw-arity</span>.  [Note added 2021: 
 this utility has been removed and is no longer necessary.]  Also, newlines are 
 printed when necessary before the value is printed.</p> 
 
 <p>For those using Unix/Linux `make': A <span class="v">cert.acl2</span> file can contain forms 
 to be evaluated before an appropriate <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> command is invoked 
 automatically (not included in <span class="v">cert.acl2</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>Jared Davis has contributed a new set of books for ordered finite set 
 theory to the standard distribution, <span class="v">books/finite-set-theory/osets-0.81/</span>. 
 See the <span class="v">README</span> file in that directory.  Thanks, Jared.</p> 
 
 <p>Robert Krug has contributed two related changes (thanks, Robert!) in 
 support of stronger arithmetic reasoning.  First, one can now enable and 
 disable nonlinear arithmetic with a <span class="v">:nonlinearp</span> hint, which will override 
 the default provided by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-NON-LINEARP.html">set-non-linearp</a></span> (initially, <span class="v">nil</span>).  See 
 <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  Second, <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a> can now have access to the 
 <span class="v">HISTORY</span>, <span class="v">PSPV</span>, and <span class="v">CTX</span> variables of the waterfall, which (for 
 example) allows the writing of a hint which will enable nonlinear arithmetic 
 on precisely those goals that are <span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span>.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Robert Krug has contributed a new set of arithmetic books to the standard 
 distribution, <span class="v">books/arithmetic-3/</span>.  See the <span class="v">README</span> file in that 
 directory.  Thanks, Robert.</p>
