<p>(macro) 
call the ACL2 prover without induction, after going into 
induction</p><pre class="code">Examples:
reduce-by-induction
  -- attempt to prove the current goal after going into induction,
     with no further inductions

(reduce-by-induction ("Subgoal 2" :by foo) ("Subgoal 1" :use bar))
  -- attempt to prove the current goal after going into induction,
     with no further inductions, using the indicated hints

General Form:
(reduce-by-induction &amp;rest hints)</pre> 
 
 <p>A subgoal will be created for each goal that would have been pushed for 
 proof by induction in an ordinary proof, except that the proof begins with a 
 top-level induction.</p> 
 
 <p>Notice that unlike <span class="v">prove</span>, the arguments to <span class="v">reduce-by-induction</span> 
 are spread out, and are all hints.  Also see <a href="ACL2-PC____PROVE.html">ACL2-pc::prove</a>, <a href="ACL2-PC____REDUCE.html">ACL2-pc::reduce</a>, and <a href="ACL2-PC____BASH.html">ACL2-pc::bash</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark</b>: Induction and the various processes will be used to the 
 extent that they are specified explicitly in the <span class="v">:induct</span> and <span class="v">:do-not</span> 
 <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.</p>
