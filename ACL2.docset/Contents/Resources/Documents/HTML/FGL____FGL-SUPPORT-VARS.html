<p>Display the list of objects corresponding to the Boolean variables used in the symbolic representation of an object</p><p>Logically, this returns its second argument; its first argument 
should be a variable symbol.  This finds which Boolean variables are used in 
the representation of the object (second argument) and prints out the objects 
from which those variables were generated.</p> 
 
<p>If you want to do anything else with this list of objects, you can get that 
list using <span class="v">(support-vars! x)</span> under an <a href="FGL____UNEQUIV.html">unequiv</a> context, or using the binder 
form <span class="v">(support-vars free-var x)</span> in a rewrite rule.</p>
