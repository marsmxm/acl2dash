remove the effect of an UNDO command</p><pre class="code">Example and General Form:
restore</pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Restore</span> removes the effect of an <span class="v">undo</span> command.  This always works 
 as expected if <span class="v">restore</span> is invoked immediately after <span class="v">undo</span>, without 
 intervening instructions.  However, other commands may also interact with 
 <span class="v">restore</span>, notably ``sequencing'' commands such as <span class="v">do-all</span>, 
 <span class="v">do-strict</span>, <span class="v">protect</span>, and more generally, <span class="v">sequence</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> Another way to control the saving of proof-builder state is 
 with the <span class="v">save</span> command; see <a href="ACL2-PC____SAVE.html">ACL2-pc::save</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">restore</span> command always ``succeeds''; it returns <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> nil t
 state)</span>.</p>
