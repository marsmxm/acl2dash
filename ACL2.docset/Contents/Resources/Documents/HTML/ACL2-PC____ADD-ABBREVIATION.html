<p>(primitive) 
add an abbreviation</p><p>Example: <span class="v">(add-abbreviation v (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x y))</span> causes future 
 occurrences of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x y)</span> to be printed as <span class="v">(? v)</span>, until (unless) a 
 corresponding invocation of <span class="v">remove-abbreviations</span> occurs.  In this case we 
 say that <span class="v">v</span> ``abbreviates'' <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x y)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(add-abbreviation var &amp;optional raw-term)</pre> 
 
 <p>Let <span class="v">var</span> be an abbreviation for <span class="v">raw-term</span>, if <span class="v">raw-term</span> is 
 supplied, else for the current subterm.  Note that <span class="v">var</span> must be a variable 
 that does not already abbreviate some term.</p> 
 
 <p>A way to think of abbreviations is as follows.  Imagine that whenever an 
 abbreviation is added, say <span class="v">v</span> abbreviates <span class="v">expr</span>, an entry associating 
 <span class="v">v</span> to <span class="v">expr</span> is made in an association list, which we will call 
 ``<span class="v">*abbreviations-alist*</span>''.  Then simply imagine that <span class="v">?</span> is a function 
 defined by something like:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> ? (v)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((pair (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ASSOC.html">assoc</a> v *abbreviations-alist*)))
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> pair (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> pair)
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ERROR.html">error</a> ...))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Of course the implementation isn't exactly like that, since the 
 ``constant'' <span class="v">*abbreviations-alist*</span> actually changes each time an 
 <span class="v">add-abbreviation</span> instruction is successfully invoked.  Nevertheless, if 
 one imagines an appropriate redefinition of the ``constant'' 
 <span class="v">*abbreviations-alist*</span> each time an <span class="v">add-abbreviation</span> is invoked, then 
 one will have a clear model of the meaning of such an instruction.</p> 
 
 <p>The effect of abbreviations on output is that before printing a term, each 
 subterm that is abbreviated by a variable <span class="v">v</span> is first replaced by <span class="v">(?
 v)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The effect of abbreviations on input is that every built-in proof-builder 
 command accepts abbreviations wherever a term is expected as an argument, 
 i.e., accepts the syntax <span class="v">(? v)</span> whenever <span class="v">v</span> abbreviates a term.  For 
 example, the second argument of <span class="v">add-abbreviation</span> may itself use 
 abbreviations that have been defined by previous <span class="v">add-abbreviation</span> 
 instructions.</p>
