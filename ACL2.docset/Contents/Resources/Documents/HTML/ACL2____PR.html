<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____PR">Click for Pr in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Print the rules stored by the event with the given name</p><pre class="code">Examples:

:pr fn ; prints the rules from the definition of fn (including any
       ; :type-prescription rule and :definition rule)

:pr assoc-append ; if assoc-append is a rewrite rule, prints that rule</pre> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____PR_12.html">pr!</a>, which is similar but works at the command level 
 instead of at the event level, and see <a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a>, which displays all rewrite 
 rules for calls of <span class="v">fn</span>, not just those introduced at definition time.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Pr</span> takes one argument, a logical name, and prints the rules associated 
 with it.  In each case it prints the rune, the current enabled/disabled 
 status, and other appropriate fields from the rule.  It may be helpful to read 
 the documentation for various kinds of rules in order to understand the 
 information printed by this command.  For example, the information printed for 
 a linear rule might be:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Rune:     (:LINEAR ABC)
Enabled:  T
Hyps:     ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X))
Concl:    (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-COUNT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)) (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-COUNT</a> X))
Max-term: (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-COUNT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X))
Backchain-limit-lst:    (3)</pre> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">hyps</span> and <span class="v">concl</span> fields for this rule are fairly 
 self-explanatory, but it is useful to see <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> to learn about maximal 
 terms (which, as one might guess, are stored under ``Max-term'').</p> 
 
 <p>Currently, this function does not print congruence rules, equivalence 
 rules, or refinement rules.</p> 
 
 <p>The expert user might also wish to use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FIND-RULES-OF-RUNE.html">find-rules-of-rune</a></span>.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____FIND-RULES-OF-RUNE.html">find-rules-of-rune</a>.</p>
