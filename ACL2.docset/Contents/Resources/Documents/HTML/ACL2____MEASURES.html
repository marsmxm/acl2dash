<p>Functions used to prove admissibility.</p><p>This theory contains the DEFUN-THEORY (see :DOC DEFUN-THEORY) of 
all functions (except those in (THEORY BUILT-INS)) that are necessary to prove 
the admissibility of recursive functions in most cases.  Note that this theory 
is probably useless without the theory BUILT-INS and some simple theory of 
arithmetic (such as the theory ALGEBRA from the book "math-lemmas".</p> 
 
<p>For functions that recur on the length of a string you may have to ENABLE 
LENGTH and LEN, as we steadfastly refuse to allow ANY globally enabled 
recursive functions.</p>
