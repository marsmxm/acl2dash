<p>Guards</p><p>Common Lisp functions are partial; they are not defined for all 
 possible inputs.  But ACL2 functions are total.  Roughly speaking, the logical 
 function of a given name in ACL2 is a <b>completion</b> of the Common Lisp 
 function of the same name obtained by adding some arbitrary but ``natural'' 
 values on arguments outside the ``intended domain'' of the Common Lisp 
 function.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 requires that every ACL2 function symbol have a ``guard,'' which may 
 be thought of as a predicate on the formals of the function describing the 
 intended domain.  The guard on the primitive function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>, 
 for example, is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> x nil))</span>, which requires the argument 
 to be either an ordered pair or <span class="v">nil</span>.  We will discuss later how to 
 specify a guard for a defined function; when one is not specified, the guard 
 is <span class="v">t</span> which is just to say all arguments are allowed.</p> 
 
 <p><b>But guards are entirely extra-logical</b>: they are not involved in the 
 axioms defining functions.  If you put a guard on a defined function, the 
 defining axiom added to the logic defines the function on <b>all</b> 
 arguments, not just on the guarded domain.</p> 
 
 <p>So what is the purpose of guards?</p> 
 
 <p>The key to the utility of guards is that we provide a mechanism, called 
 ``guard verification,'' for checking that all the guards in a formula are 
 true.  See <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>.  This mechanism will attempt to prove that 
 all the guards encountered in the evaluation of a guarded function are true 
 every time they are encountered.</p>
