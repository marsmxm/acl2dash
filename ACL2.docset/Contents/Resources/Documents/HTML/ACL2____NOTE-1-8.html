<p>ACL2 Version 1.8 (May, 1995) Notes</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____NOTE-1-8-UPDATE.html">note-1-8-update</a> for yet more recent changes.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">Guard</a>s have been eliminated from the ACL2 logic.  A summary is 
 contained in this brief note.  Also see <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> and see <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">Guard</a>s may be included in <a href="ACL2____DEFUNS.html">defuns</a> as usual but are ignored 
 from the perspective of admission to the logic: functions must terminate on 
 all arguments.</p> 
 
 <p>As in Nqthm, primitive functions, e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>, 
 logically default unexpected arguments to convenient values.  Thus, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 'abc
 3)</span> is <span class="v">3</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 'abc)</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a>, and 
 see the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for the individual primitive functions.</p> 
 
 <p>In contrast to earlier versions of ACL2, Version 1.8 logical functions are 
 executed at Nqthm speeds even when <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s have not been verified.  In 
 versions before 1.8, such functions were interpreted by ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>Colors have been eliminated.  Two ``<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>s'' are supported, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>.  Roughly speaking, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> does what <span class="v">:red</span> used to do, namely, allow you to prototype 
 functions for execution without any proof burdens.  <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">Logic</a></span> mode 
 does what <span class="v">:blue</span> used to do, namely, allow you to add a new definitional 
 axiom to the logic.  A global <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a> is comparable to the 
 old default color.  The system comes up in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.  To 
 change the global <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>, type <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> or 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> at the top-level.  To specify the <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> of a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> locally use</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"> <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :mode mode))</span>.  </pre> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a> has changed.  The initial <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a>, indicating 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode, is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>If you change to <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode the <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a> becomes</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 p!&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">Guard</a>s can be seen as having either of two roles: (a) they are a 
 specification device allowing you to characterize the kinds of inputs a 
 function ``should'' have, or (b) they are an efficiency device allowing 
 logically defined functions to be executed directly in Common Lisp.  If a 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> is specified, as with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span>, then it 
 is ``verified'' at defun-time (unless you also specify <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> 
 <span class="v">:verify-guards nil</span>).  <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">Guard</a> verification means what it always has: 
 the input <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> is shown to imply the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s on all subroutines 
 in the body.  If the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of a function are verified, then a call of 
 the function on inputs satisfying the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> can be computed directly by 
 Common Lisp.  Thus, verifying the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s on your functions will allow 
 them to execute more efficiently.  But it does not affect their logical 
 behavior and since you will automatically get Nqthm speeds on unverified 
 logical definitions, most users will probably use <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s either as a 
 specification device or only use them when execution efficiency is extremely 
 important.</p> 
 
 <p>Given the presence of <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s in the system, two issues are 
 unavoidable.  Are <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s verified as part of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> process? 
 And are <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s checked when terms are evaluated?  We answer both of 
 those questions below.</p> 
 
 <p>Roughly speaking, in its initial <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> the system will try to verify 
 the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> if a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span> is supplied in 
 the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> and will not try otherwise.  However, <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> 
 verification in <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> can be inhibited ``locally'' by supplying the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> <span class="v">nil</span>.  ``Global'' inhibition can 
 be obtained via the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-VERIFY-GUARDS-EAGERNESS.html">set-verify-guards-eagerness</a></span>.  If you do not 
 use the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span> <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span>, you will not need to think about 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> verification.</p> 
 
 <p>We now turn to the evaluation of expressions.  Even if your functions 
 contain no <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s, the primitive functions do and hence you have the 
 choice: when you submit an expression for evaluation do you mean for <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s to be checked at runtime or not?  Put another way, do you mean for the 
 expression to be evaluated in Common Lisp (if possible) or in the logic? 
 Note: If Common Lisp delivers an answer, it will be the same as in the logic, 
 but it might be erroneous to execute the form in Common Lisp.  For example, 
 should <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 'abc)</span> cause a <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> violation error or return 
 <span class="v">nil</span>?</p> 
 
 <p>The top-level ACL2 loop has a variable which controls which sense of 
 execution is provided.  To turn ``<a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> checking on,'' by which we mean 
 that <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s are checked at runtime, execute the top-level form 
 <span class="v">:set-guard-checking t</span>.  To turn it off, do <span class="v">:set-guard-checking nil</span>. 
 The status of this variable is reflected in the <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>means <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> checking is on and</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 &gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>means <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> checking is off.  The exclamation mark can be thought of 
 as ``barring'' certain computations.  The absence of the mark suggests the 
 absence of error messages or unbarred access to the logical axioms.  Thus, for 
 example</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 'abc)</pre> 
 
 <p>will signal an error, while</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 &gt;(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 'abc)</pre> 
 
 <p>will return <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that whether or not <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s are checked at runtime is 
 independent of whether you are operating in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode or 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode and whether theorems are being proved or not. 
 (Although it must be added that functions defined in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> 
 mode cannot help but check their <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s because no logical definition 
 exists.)</p> 
 
 <p>Version 1.8 permits the verification of the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of theorems, thus 
 insuring that all instances of the theorem will evaluate without error in 
 Common Lisp.  To verify the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of a theorem named <span class="v">name</span> execute 
 the event</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> name).</pre> 
 
 <p>If a theorem's <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s have been verified, the theorem is guaranteed 
 to evaluate without error to non-<span class="v">nil</span> in Common Lisp (provided resource 
 errors do not arise).</p> 
 
 <p>Caveat about <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span>: <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> is a function symbol, 
 so in the term <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> p q)</span>, <span class="v">p</span> cannot be assumed true when <span class="v">q</span> 
 is evaluated; they are both evaluated ``outside.''  Hence, you cannot 
 generally verify the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s on a theorem if <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> is used to 
 state the hypotheses.  Use <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> instead.  In a future version of ACL2, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> will likely be a macro.</p> 
 
 <p>See sum-list-example.lisp for a nice example of the use of Version 1.8. 
 This is roughly the same as the documentation for <a href="ACL2____GUARD-EXAMPLE.html">guard-example</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We have removed the capability to do ``old-style-forcing'' as existed 
 before Version 1.5.  See <a href="ACL2____NOTE-1-5.html">note-1-5</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>NOTE: Some low level details have, of course, changed.  One such change is 
 that there are no longer two distinct type prescriptions stored when a 
 function is admitted with its <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s verified.  So for example, the 
 type prescription <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></span> is now</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(:type-prescription binary-append)</pre> 
 
 <p>while in Versions 1.7 and earlier, there were two such <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(:type-prescription binary-append . 1)
(:type-prescription binary-append . 2)</pre> 
 
 <p>Nqthm-style forcing on <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> arithmetic assumptions is no longer 
 executed when forcing is <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.</p> 
 
 <p>Functional instantiation now benefits from a trick also used in Nqthm: once 
 a <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a> generated by a <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> lemma instance 
 (see <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>) has been proved on behalf of a successful event, 
 it will not have to be re-proved on behalf of a later event.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____1_B2.html">1+</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a></span> are now macros in the logic, not functions. 
 Hence, for example, it is ``safe'' to use them on left-hand sides of rewrite 
 rules, without invoking the common warning about the presence of nonrecursive 
 function symbols.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> section <a href="ACL2____FILE-READING-EXAMPLE.html">file-reading-example</a> illustrates 
 how to process forms in a file.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command <span class="v">forwardchain</span> has been added; see 
 <a href="ACL2-PC____FORWARDCHAIN.html">ACL2-pc::forwardchain</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now possible to use quantifiers.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>There is a new event <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a></span>, which allows the user to 
 turn off warnings of various types.  see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>An unsoundness relating <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> and <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> 
 <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> has been remedied, with a few small effects visible at the user 
 level.  The main observable effect is that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> and non-local 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> are no longer allowed in the scope of any 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event that has a non-empty <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> is called, we now require that the default <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> (see <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-DEFUN-MODE.html">default-defun-mode</a>) be <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>.  On a 
 related note, the default <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> is irrelevant to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>; the mode is always set to <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> initially, though 
 it may be changed within the book and reverts to its original value at the 
 conclusion of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  A bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 prevented it from acting this way even though the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> said 
 otherwise.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been substantially improved.  A new section 
 ``Programming'' contains <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> of many useful functions 
 provided by ACL2; see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a>.  Also, the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has 
 been ``marked up'' extensively.  Thus in particular, users of Mosaic will find 
 many links in the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The symbols <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span>, and <span class="v">acl2-count</span> have been 
 added to the list <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We now permit most names from the main Lisp package to be used as names, 
 except for names that define functions, macros, or constants.  See <a href="ACL2____NAME.html">name</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We have changed the list of imports from the Common Lisp package to ACL2, 
 i.e., the list <span class="v">*common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*</span>, to be 
 exactly those external symbols of the Common Lisp package as specified by the 
 draft Common Lisp standard.  In order to accommodate this change, we have 
 renamed some ACL2 functions as shown below, but these and other ramifications 
 of this change should be transparent to most ACL2 users.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">warning      --&gt; warning$
print-object --&gt; print-object$</pre> 
 
 <p>Proof trees are no longer enabled by default.  To start them up, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____START-PROOF-TREE.html">start-proof-tree</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We have added the capability of building smaller images.  The easiest way 
 to do this on a Unix (trademark of AT&amp;T) system is: <span class="v">make small</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here we will put some less important changes, additions, and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>We have added definitions for the Common Lisp function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____POSITION.html">position</a></span> 
 (for the test <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span>), as well as corresponding versions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POSITION-EQUAL.html">position-equal</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POSITION-EQ.html">position-eq</a></span> that use tests <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>, respectively.  See <a href="COMMON-LISP____POSITION.html">position</a>, see <a href="ACL2____POSITION-EQUAL.html">position-equal</a>, and 
 see <a href="ACL2____POSITION-EQ.html">position-eq</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event <span class="v">rational-listp-implies-rationalp-car</span> no 
 longer exists.</p> 
 
 <p>We fixed a bug in the hint mechanism that applied <span class="v">:by</span>, <span class="v">:cases</span>, 
 and <span class="v">:use</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> to the first induction goal when the prover 
 reverted to proving the original goal by induction.</p> 
 
 <p>We fixed a bug in the handling of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-IRRELEVANT-FORMALS-OK.html">set-irrelevant-formals-ok</a>
 :warn)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>In support of removing the old-style forcing capability, we deleted the 
 initialization of <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global <span class="v">old-style-forcing</span> and deleted the 
 definitions of <span class="v">recover-assumptions</span>, <span class="v">recover-assumptions-from-goal</span>, 
 <span class="v">remove-assumptions1</span>, <span class="v">remove-assumptions</span>, and 
 <span class="v">split-on-assumptions</span>, and we renamed <span class="v">split-on-assumptions1</span> to 
 <span class="v">split-on-assumptions</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The special value <span class="v">'none</span> in the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> commands 
 <span class="v">claim</span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a></span> has been replaced by <span class="v">:none</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug in the handling of <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> by subgoals has been fixed.  For 
 example, formerly a <span class="v">:do-not</span> hint could be ``erased'' by a <span class="v">:use</span> hint 
 on a subgoal.  Thanks go to Art Flatau for noticing the bug.</p> 
 
 <p>The functions <span class="v">weak-termp</span> and <span class="v">weak-term-listp</span> have been deleted, 
 and their calls have been replaced by corresponding calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> and <span class="v">pseudo-term-listp</span>.  The notion of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> 
 has been slightly strengthened by requiring that terms of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a>
 ...)</span> have length 2.</p> 
 
 <p>Performance has been improved in various ways.  At the prover level, 
 backchaining through the recognizer alist has been eliminated in order to 
 significantly speed up ACL2's rewriter.  Among the other prover changes (of 
 which there are several, all technical): we no longer clausify the input term 
 when a proof is interrupted in favor of inducting on the input term.  At the 
 <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a> level, we have improved performance somewhat by suitable 
 declarations and proclamations.  These include technical modifications to the 
 macros <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, and introduction of a macro <span class="v">the-mv</span> 
 analogous to the macro <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a></span> but for forms returning multiple 
 values.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">spaces</span> now takes an extra argument, the current 
 column.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug in the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> <span class="v">equiv</span> command was fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">intersectp</span> has been deleted, because it was essentially 
 duplicated by the function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERSECTP-EQUAL.html">intersectp-equal</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We now proclaim functions in AKCL and GCL before compiling <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>. 
 This should result in somewhat increased speed.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">repeat</span> has been eliminated; use <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MAKE-LIST.html">make-list</a></span> 
 instead.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command <span class="v">expand</span> has been fixed so that it 
 eliminates <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> (lambda) expressions when one would expect it to.</p> 
 
 <p>A new primitive function, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span>, has been introduced.  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">Mv-nth</a></span> is equivalent to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a></span> and is used in place of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a></span> in 
 the translation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> expressions.  This allows the user to 
 control the simplification of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> expressions without affecting how 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a></span> is treated.  In that spirit, the rewriter has been modified so 
 that certain <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span> expressions, namely those produced in the 
 translation of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a> (a b c)(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> x y z) p)</span>, are given special 
 treatment.</p> 
 
 <p>A minor bug in <span class="v">untranslate</span> has been fixed, which for example will fix 
 the printing of conjunctions.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Translate</span> now takes a <span class="v">logicp</span> argument, which indicates whether it 
 enforces the restriction that <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions do not 
 occur in the result.</p> 
 
 <p>The modified version of <span class="v">trace</span> provided by ACL2, for use in raw Lisp, 
 has been modified so that the lisp special variable <span class="v">*trace-alist*</span> has a 
 slightly different functionality.  This alist associates, using <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>, 
 symbols with the print representations of their values.  For example, 
 initially <span class="v">*trace-alist*</span> is a one-element list containing the pair 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'state '|*the-live-state*|)</span>.  Thus, one may cons the pair <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a>
 '*foo* "It's a FOO!")</span> on to <span class="v">*trace-alist*</span>; then until <span class="v">*foo*</span> is 
 defined, this change will have no effect, but after for example</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> *foo* 17)</pre> 
 
 <p>then <span class="v">trace</span> will print <span class="v">17</span> as <span class="v">"It's a FOO!"</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Trace</span> also traces the corresponding logic function.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">Proof-tree</a> display has been improved slightly in the case of 
 successful proofs and certain event failures.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">positive-integer-log2</span> has been deleted.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> now prints a warning message when it is 
 encountered in the context of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event or a book.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Some functions related to <span class="v">the-fn</span> and <span class="v">wormhole1</span> now have <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span>, but this change is almost certain to be 
 inconsequential to all users.</p>
