<p>How to distribute XDOC manuals for other people to use.</p><p>After you have documented your books with XDOC and created a 
manual, you may wish to share your manual with coworkers, collaborators, 
customers, sponsors, etc.  The best way to do this may depend on many 
factors.</p> 
 
<p>By default, the manuals created by <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">save</a> use only client-side 
JavaScript code.  This makes deployment very easy: you can just copy the files 
to wherever you like, and you don't even need a web server.</p> 
 
<p>This approach—just copying the default manual—is well-suited 
for:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Browsing from your local hard-drive, or</li> 
<li>Browsing from a fast NFS drive or intranet server</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>But the default manuals will <b>perform badly on slow connections</b>.  So, 
if your users are going to read the manual over, e.g., VPNs or public web 
sites, then you may wish to read on.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Server-Supported Manuals</h3> 
 
<p>The basic reason that the default manuals are slow is that they work by 
simply loading the data for <b>every</b> topic, at startup.  As of October 
2013, this comes to around 25 MB of data for the basic <span class="v">doc/top.lisp</span> 
manual.  It's no big deal to load 25 MB from a local hard drive or a fast 
intranet connection, but it can be quite slow over the internet.</p> 
 
<p>The XDOC manuals created by <span class="v">save</span> can be reconfigured to just load the 
<span class="v">:long</span> sections as they are accessed.  This results in a much 
faster-loading manual, and is how, for instance, the <a href="http://fv.centtech.com/acl2/latest/doc/" target="_blank"><nobr>online XDOC manual<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://fv.centtech.com/acl2/latest/doc/"></nobr></a> at 
Centaur is deployed.</p> 
 
<p>This option requires a small amount of configuration, and you may need to 
coordinate with your network administrator to get certain software 
installed.</p> 
 
<p>If you want to use our scripts directly, you will need a web server that 
supports <a href="http://www.perl.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Perl<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.perl.org"></nobr></a> scripts with the CGI, DBI, and 
DBD::SQLite modules installed.  If for some reason this poses a problem, you 
may find that you can easily port these scripts to other popular languages, 
like PHP or Ruby, with SQLite support.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Step 1: Create the Database</h4> 
 
<p>In the manual directory you created with the <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">save</a> command, you should 
find a Perl script named <span class="v">xdata2sql.pl</span>.  When you run this script, you 
should see something like the following output:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cd my-library/manual
$ perl xdata2sql.pl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

xdata2sql.pl: Convert xdata.js into xdata.db (an sqlite3 database)

   NOTE: Most folks don't need to run this at all!
         If you just want to:
          - browse an XDOC manual on your local hard drive, or
          - share an XDOC manual on your fast intranet
         then ignore this script and just see index.html.

The main use for this script is to share XDOC manuals on the internet.  In this
scenario, just having the web browser load in the entire (generally 20+ MB)
xdata.js file is not very practical, because some users will have slow
connections and will take too long to load the file.

There are many ways to solve this.  Our approach is to convert xdata.js into an
sqlite3 database, and then use a server-side script that will allow us to
access topics only as they are requested.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Converting xdata.js

; Reading file
; Checking file
; Parsing JSON data.
; Creating new xdata.db.
; Creating xdoc_data table.
; Populating xdoc_data table.
; All done.

To actually use the database, see xdataget.pl.</pre> 
 
<p>After this step, you should have a new file named <span class="v">xdata.db</span> in your 
manual directory.  This is an SQLite3 database that has the information for 
your XDOC topics.  It should be roughly as large as <span class="v">xdata.js</span>.</p> 
 
<p>If you are missing some required Perl modules, then instead of the above 
output you may see a message such as</p> 
 
<pre class="code">Can't locate DBI.pm in @INC ...</pre> 
 
<p>In this case, you may need to ask your systems administrator to install the 
missing modules.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Step 2: Set up the Web Server</h4> 
 
<p>Once you have created the <span class="v">xdata.db</span> file, you will need to copy both it 
and a different script, <span class="v">xdataget.pl</span>, to some directory in your web 
server.</p> 
 
<p>Typically, for <span class="v">xdataget.pl</span> to work at all, it will need to have its 
executable bit set, and it may need to be in a special directory within your 
web server, typically named <span class="v">cgi-bin</span>.</p> 
 
<p>To make sure the script is working, you should now load it in your web 
browser by going to, e.g., <span class="v">http://my-server/cgi-bin/xdataget.pl</span>.  If 
everything is working, you should see a page that looks like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">{"results":[

]}</pre> 
 
<p>If, instead, you see a message like <i>Internal Server Error</i>, then you 
may have a permissions problem, or your web server's version of Perl may be 
missing a require library, or something else may be wrong; ask your systems 
administrator for help.</p> 
 
<p>You may also wish to load, e.g.,:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">http://my-server/cgi-bin/xdataget.pl?keys=ACL2____TOP</pre> 
 
<p>and make sure that you can see some text from your top topic.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Step 3: Configure the Manual to use the Server</h4> 
 
<p>The final step is to edit the file <span class="v">config.js</span> in your manual. 
This file contains comments with the example syntax.  Basically you 
just need to change:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">var XDATAGET = "";</pre> 
 
<p>To have the right URL for your xdataget.pl script, e.g., into:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">var XDATAGET = "http://my-server/cgi-bin/xdataget.pl";</pre> 
 
<p>At this point, your manual should load topic data dynamically as needed. 
The result should be much faster for users on slow connections.</p>
