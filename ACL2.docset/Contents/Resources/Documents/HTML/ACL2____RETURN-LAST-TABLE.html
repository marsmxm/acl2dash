<p>Install special raw Lisp behavior</p><p>Please first see <a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a> for relevant background.</p> 
 
 <p>This <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> is for advanced users only, and requires an active trust 
 tag (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>).  We recommend that you do not modify this table 
 directly, but instead use the macro <span class="v">defmacro-last</span>.  Here we augment that 
 discussion with some highly technical observations that can probably be 
 ignored if you use <span class="v">defmacro-last</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>This <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> has a <span class="v">:guard</span> requiring that each key be a symbol 
 defined in raw Lisp, generally as a macro, and requiring that each 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> value be associated either with a symbol that names a macro 
 defined in ACL2, or else with a list of one element containing such a symbol. 
 The table can only be modified when there is an active trust tag; see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>.  If a key is associated with the value <span class="v">nil</span>, then that key is 
 treated as though it were not in the table.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that keys of this table are not eligible to be bound by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____FLET.html">flet</a></span>. 
 The current value of this table may be obtained by evaluating the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE-ALIST.html">table-alist</a> 'return-last-table (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span>.  The built-in constant 
 <span class="v">*initial-return-last-table*</span> holds the initial value of this table.</p>
