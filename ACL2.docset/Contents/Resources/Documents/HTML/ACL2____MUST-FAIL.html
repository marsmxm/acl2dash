<p>A top-level <a href="ACL2____ASSERT_42.html">assert$</a>-like command.  Ensures that a command 
which returns an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>—e.g., <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> or <a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a>—will not be successful.</p><p>This can be useful for adding simple unit tests of macros, 
theories, etc. to your books.  Basic examples:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a>                      ;; succeeds
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> 5))                    ;;   (invalid defun will indeed fail)

(<a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a>                      ;; causes an error
  (<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> t))                      ;;   (because this thm proves fine)

(<a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a> (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> nil (<a href="ACL2____HARD-ERROR.html">hard-error</a> 'foo "MESSAGE" nil) state))
                                ;; causes an error
                                ;;   (because hard errors propagate past
                                ;;    must-fail by default)

(<a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a> (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> nil (<a href="ACL2____HARD-ERROR.html">hard-error</a> 'foo "MESSAGE" nil) state)
           :expected :hard)     ;; succeeds

(<a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a>                      ;; causes an error
  (<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> floor)))   ;;   (because this works fine)

(<a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a>                      ;; causes an error
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 3 4))                      ;;   (doesn't return an error triple)</pre> 
 
<p>Must-fail is almost just like <a href="ACL2____MUST-SUCCEED.html">must-succeed</a>, except that the event is 
expected to fail instead of succeed.  The option <span class="v">:expected</span> is described 
below; for everything else, please see the documentation for <span class="v">must-succeed</span> 
for syntax, options, and additional discussion.</p> 
 
<p>Also see <a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL-WITH-ERROR.html">must-fail-with-error</a>, <a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL-WITH-SOFT-ERROR.html">must-fail-with-soft-error</a>, and 
<a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL-WITH-HARD-ERROR.html">must-fail-with-hard-error</a>, which are essentially aliases for 
<span class="v">must-fail</span> with different values for the option, <span class="v">:expected</span>, which we 
now describe.</p> 
 
<p>When the value of keyword <span class="v">:expected</span> is <span class="v">:any</span>, then <span class="v">must-fail</span> 
succeeds if and only if ACL2 causes an error during evaluation of the supplied 
form.  However <span class="v">:expected</span> is <span class="v">:soft</span> by default, in which case success 
requires that the error is ``soft'', not ``hard'': hard errors are caused by 
guard violations, by calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ILLEGAL.html">illegal</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HARD-ERROR.html">hard-error</a></span>, and by 
calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a></span> that are not ``soft''.  Finally, if <span class="v">:expected</span> is 
<span class="v">:hard</span>, then the call of <span class="v">must-fail</span> succeeds if and only if evaluation 
of the form causes a hard error.</p> 
 
<p>CAVEAT: If a book contains a non-<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> form that causes proofs to be 
done, such as one of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a> (<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> ...))</span>, then it might not be 
possible to include that book.  That is because proofs are generally skipped 
during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, and any <span class="v">thm</span> will succeed if proofs are 
skipped.  One fix is to make such forms <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a>.  Another fix is to use a 
wrapper <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL_12.html">must-fail!</a></span> that creates a call of <span class="v">must-fail</span> with 
<span class="v">:check-expansion</span> to <span class="v">t</span>; that causes proofs to be done even when 
including a book (because of the way that <span class="v">must-fail</span> is implemented using 
<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span>).</p>
