<p>Options for running SAT solvers that produce UNSAT proofs.</p><p>For higher confidence (at some cost to runtime), some SAT solvers 
are able to produce UNSAT proofs.  Small programs such as <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/" target="_blank"><nobr>drat-trim<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/"></nobr></a> can check 
these proofs, to ensure the SAT solver reasoned correctly.</p> 
 
<p>Satlink now includes Perl scripts that can make use of this capability for 
the Glucose and Riss3g solvers.  In particular, see the following scripts:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li><span class="v">centaur/satlink/solvers/glucose-cert</span></li> 
<li><span class="v">centaur/satlink/solvers/riss3g-cert</span></li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The general idea of these scripts is, e.g., for Glucose:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We first call Glucose to solve the problem;</li> 
 
<li>When Glucose reports SAT, we just exit (because Satlink can check the 
satisfying assignment itself); or</li> 
 
<li>When Glucose reports UNSAT, we check the proof using the Drat-Trim unsat 
proof checker.  We only print an "s UNSATISFIABLE" line if Drat-Trim says 
that the proof is ok.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>All of this works well with Satlink.  You can still see the output from the 
solver and the verifier in real time, interrupt it, etc.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Setup</h3> 
 
<p>To use these tools, you will need to first:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Install <span class="v">glucose</span> and/or <span class="v">riss3g</span> as described in <a href="SATLINK____SAT-SOLVER-OPTIONS.html">sat-solver-options</a>, and</li> 
 
<li>Install the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/" target="_blank"><nobr>drat-trim<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~marijn/drat-trim/"></nobr></a> program as 
<span class="v">drat-trim</span> somewhere in your PATH.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>You can then add the <span class="v">glucose-cert</span> or <span class="v">riss3g-cert</span> scripts to your 
PATH.  As a quick test to ensure things are working, you can try to certify 
these books:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">cd [books]/centaur/satlink/solvers
cert.pl test-glucose-cert
cert.pl test-riss3g-cert</pre> 
 
<p>To use these scripts from Satlink, you can then typically just use a Satlink 
configuration such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="SATLINK____MAKE-CONFIG.html">satlink::make-config</a> :cmdline "glucose-cert" ...)</pre> 
 
 
<h3>Skipping Proof Checking During Development</h3> 
 
<p>The environment variable SATLINK_TRUST_SOLVER can be set to 1 to suppress 
proof checking.  When this variable is set, we will NOT instruct the solver to 
produce an UNSAT proof and (of course) will not check the non-existent 
proof.</p> 
 
<p>We use this feature as follows:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We generally set <span class="v">SATLINK_TRUST_SOLVER=1</span> in our startup scripts.  This 
way, when we are working with ACL2 (either interactively, or when rebuilding 
books), we just trust the solver and avoid the overhead of UNSAT checking.</li> 
 
<li>We set <span class="v">SATLINK_TRUST_SOLVER=0</span> for our nightly regressions.  These are 
run automatically, overnight, so performance is not very important.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This gives us a good blend of performance and confidence.  If the solver 
somehow screws up and claims to have proven a theorem that isn't really true, 
we may not find out about it until our regression fails.  But in exchange, we 
can always use <span class="v">glucose-cert</span> with no performance impact on our everyday 
work.</p>
