<p>Hey Wait!  Is ACL2 Typed or Untyped?</p><p>The example</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;<b>(app 7 27)</b> 
 
ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function symbol ENDP, which 
is (OR (CONSP X) (EQUAL X NIL)), is violated by the arguments in the 
call (ENDP 7). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>illustrates the fact that while ACL2 is an untyped language the ACL2 
 evaluator can be configured so as to check ``types'' at runtime.  We should 
 not say ``types'' here but ``guards.''  See <a href="ACL2____Guards_02in_02ACL2.html">Guards in ACL2</a> for a 
 discussion of guards.</p> 
 
 <p>The guard on <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 requires its argument to be a true list.  Since 7 is not a true list, and 
 since ACL2 is checking guards in this example, an error is signaled by ACL2. 
 How do you know ACL2 is checking guards?  Because the prompt tells us (click 
 <a href="ACL2____About_02the_02Prompt.html">here</a>) with its ``!''.</p>
