<p>Functions for randomly vector simulations of Hons <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">aig</a>s.</p><p>Simulating AIGs on random vectors is useful in algorithms such as 
<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.66.3434" target="_blank"><nobr>fraiging<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.66.3434"></nobr></a>, 
to look for nodes that are probably equivalent and might be merged.</p> 
 
<p>Our hons-based <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">aig</a> representation is not especially efficient or 
well-suited for carrying out random simulations, and nowadays <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> is 
a much faster alternative.  Nevertheless, we have developed various routines 
for vector-simulations of Hons AIGs.</p> 
 
<p>Note that some of these routines make use of 60-bit natural numbers, which 
are fixnums on 64-bit CCL and SBCL.  They may perform quite badly on other 
Lisps with smaller fixnum ranges.</p>
