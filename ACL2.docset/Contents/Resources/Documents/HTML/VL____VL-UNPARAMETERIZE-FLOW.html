<p>How the heck does unparameterization/elaboration work?</p><h3>Basic Idea</h3> 
 
<p>Our algorithm processes a list of <i>signatures</i> that specify what 
modules we want to create with what parameters.</p> 
 
<p>We start from the top-level modules.  Any module that is never instantiated 
is assumed to be a top-level module, and we'll use its default parameters (if 
it has parameters).  The initial signature list has the top level modules, 
associated with their default parameters.</p> 
 
<p>Recursively, to create a module with a set of parameters, we apply <a href="VL____VL-GENBLOB-RESOLVE.html">vl-genblob-resolve</a>, which substitutes the parameter values everywhere they're 
needed, and then examines the module instances.  For each module instance that 
has parameters, we add to our list of signatures the needed module, and replace 
that instance with a parameter-free instance of that module.  (The function 
that does this on each instance is <a href="VL____VL-UNPARAM-INST.html">vl-unparam-inst</a>.)</p> 
 
<p>When we're done with the current module, we recur on the list of signatures 
we accumulated; when we're done with those, we've completely unparameterized 
the module and all of its dependencies.  This is what <a href="VL____VL-UNPARAMETERIZE-MAIN.html">vl-unparameterize-main</a> does.</p> 
 
<h3>Tricky Parts</h3> 
 
<h2>Scoping</h2> 
 
<p>When we unparameterize a module instance like</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module supermod ; 
  ...
  foo #(.size(64), .kind(foo_t)) myinst (...) ;
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>The actual parameter arguments (64, foo_t) need to be resolved in the scope 
of supermod.  But then, we are going to create a signature for specializing 
<span class="v">foo</span> that binds size to 64, kind to foo_t.  What scope are these bindings 
relative to?  Our answer is: they need to be independent of scope.</p> 
 
<p>To accomplish this, for value parameters (e.g. size) we insist that the each 
value gets resolved to a literal (e.g., 64, "foo", etc.), and such literals 
are of course independent of scope.  If we can't resolve a parameter, e.g., you 
write <span class="v">.size(a+b)</span> and we don't know what a/b are, then we are just going to 
fail to unparameterize this.</p> 
 
<p>For type parameters the situation is harder.  We can't simply replace a 
named type like foo_t with its definition (recursively), because various rules 
in SystemVerilog prohibit that, especially pertaining to signedness.</p> 
 
<blockquote> 
<p>(Digression: e.g., consider the type foo_t:</p> 
<pre class="code">typedef logic signed [3:0] [5:0] signedarr_t;
typedef signedarr_t [7:0] foo_t;</pre> 
<p>You can't define foo_t without a subsidiary typedef, because there's no way 
to directly express a multidimensional array of which some inner dimension is 
signed.)</p> 
</blockquote> 
 
<p>So what to do?  Our approach is to annotate the named type (see <a href="VL____VL-USERTYPE.html">vl-usertype</a>) with its definition as the <span class="v">res</span> field of the <a href="VL____VL-USERTYPE.html">vl-usertype</a>; any usertypes referenced in the <span class="v">res</span> field also are similarly 
annotated with their definitions, recursively.  This is similar to expressing 
it as one monolithically defined type, but we can tell which parts are named, 
which lets us be faithful to the awkward semantics.  However, the names are 
basically vestigial -- we don't generally know what scope they're from, so it 
doesn't make sense to look them up anywhere!</p> 
 
<p>In summary: the actual values for type parameters in our signatures are 
scope agnostic in the sense that we know we can't trust their names, and in 
the sense that we don't need their names to know anything about them, because 
we have these <span class="v">res</span> fields to use instead.</p> 
 
<h2>Sharing Isomorphically Parameterized Modules</h2> 
 
<p>If a module is instantiated twice with the same parameters, we don't want to 
create two different unparameterized versions of that module.  However, we need 
to be careful not to share a definition for two modules whose parameters look 
the same, but are actually different.  E.g., a module with a type parameter may 
be instantiated twice with two types that have the same name, but refer to 
different definitions because they occur in different scopes.</p> 
 
<p>To keep track of this, we create a key for each module instantiation.  Two 
module instantiations should produce the same key only if they are 
instantiations of the same module, all value parameters resolve to the same 
values, and all type parameters are the same up to and including the scope in 
which any usertypes are defined.  To track which scope is which, we use <a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-_E3HASHKEY.html">vl-scopestack-&gt;hashkey</a>, which reduces a scopestack to a hierarchy of 
names.</p> 
 
<h2>Indirect Parameterization Via Interface Ports</h2> 
 
<p>If an interface is instantiated with a set of parameters and then passed to 
a module instance, that instance differs from a similar instance that is passed 
an interface instantiated with different parameters, even if the parameters two 
the two instances are the same (or there aren't any parameters).</p>
