<p>Representation of an assignment statement.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL2014____VL-STMT.html">vl-stmt</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>type — <a href="VL2014____VL-ASSIGN-TYPE-P.html">vl-assign-type-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Kind of assignment statement, e.g., blocking, nonblocking, etc.</dd> 
 
<dt>lvalue — <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Location being assigned to.  Note that the Verilog-2005 standard 
               places various restrictions on lvalues, e.g., for a procedural 
               assignment the lvalue may contain only plain variables, and 
               bit-selects, part-selects, memory words, and nested 
               concatenations of these things.  We do not enforce these 
               restrictions in <span class="v">vl-assignstmt-p</span>, but only require that the 
               lvalue is an expression.</dd> 
 
<dt>expr — <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The right-hand side expression that should be assigned to the 
               lvalue.</dd> 
 
<dt>ctrl — <a href="VL2014____VL-MAYBE-DELAYOREVENTCONTROL.html">vl-maybe-delayoreventcontrol</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Control that affects when the assignment is done, if any.  These 
               controls can be a delay like <span class="v">#(6)</span> or an event control like 
               <span class="v">@(posedge clk)</span>.  The rules for this are covered in Section 
               9.2 and appear to perhaps be different depending upon the type 
               of assignment.  Further coverage seems to be available in 
               Section 9.7.7.</dd> 
 
<dt>atts — <a href="VL2014____VL-ATTS.html">vl-atts</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Any attributes associated with this statement.</dd> 
 
<dt>loc — <a href="VL2014____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Where the statement was found in the source code.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>Assignment statements are covered in Section 9.2.  There are two 
major types of assignment statements.</p> 
 
<h4>Procedural Assignments</h4> 
 
<p>Procedural assignment statements may only be used to assign to <span class="v">reg</span>, 
<span class="v">integer</span>, <span class="v">time</span>, <span class="v">realtime</span>, and memory data types, and cannot be 
used to assign to ordinary nets such as <span class="v">wire</span>s.  There are two kinds of 
procedural assignments: </p> 
 
<pre class="code">foo = bar ;     // "blocking" -- do the assignment now
foo &lt;= bar ;    // "nonblocking" -- schedule the assignment to occur</pre> 
 
<p>The difference between these two statements has to do with Verilog's timing 
model and simulation semantics.  In particular, a blocking assignment 
"executes before the statements that follow it," whereas a non-blocking 
assignment only "schedules" an assignment to occur and can be thought of as 
executing in parallel with what follows it.</p> 
 
<h4>Continuous Procedural Assignments</h4> 
 
<p>Continuous procedural assignment statements may apparently be used to assign 
to either nets or variables.  There are two kinds:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign foo = bar ;  // only for variables
force foo = bar ;   // for variables or nets</pre> 
 
<p>We represent all of these kinds of assignment statements uniformly as 
<span class="v">vl-assignstmt-p</span> objects.</p> 
 
<h4>SystemVerilog Extensions</h4> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog-2012 implements special additional assignment operators such 
as <span class="v">a += b</span>.  Per Section 11.4 of SystemVerilog-2012, these operators are 
semantically equivalent to blocking assignment statements except that in the 
case of index expressions such as <span class="v">a[i] += b</span>, the index <span class="v">i</span> is only 
evaluated once.  VL's parser converts assignments such as <span class="v">a += b</span> into 
blocking assignments such as <span class="v">a = a + b</span>.  To note that this was a <span class="v">+=</span> 
style assignment, the parser adds a <span class="v">VL_FANCY_ASSIGNMENT_OPERATOR</span> attribute 
to the assignstmt.</p> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog also adds increment and decrement operators, i.e., <span class="v">a++</span> 
and <span class="v">a--</span>.  These operators, per Section 11.4.2 of SystemVerilog-2012, also 
"behave as blocking assignments." VL2014 does not really support these 
operators but they may be supported in the newer <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a>.</p>
