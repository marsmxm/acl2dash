<p>Database.</p><p>As explained in [YP:D.1] and [YP:4.1], 
     <a href="ETHEREUM____MMP-TREES.html">MMP trees</a> 
     rely on a database that associates byte arrays to hashes, 
     where hashes are byte arrays of length 32 resulting from Keccak-256. 
     This is called `trie database' in [YP:D.1], and just `DB' in [Wiki:MMP]. 
     [YP:4.1] uses the term `state database', 
     but it does so in the context of the world state; 
     indeed, 
     the database also contains data that is not part of the world state, 
     such as transactions and transaction receipts. 
     In the documentation of our Ethereum model, we use the term `database'.</p><p>We introduce a <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fixtype</a> for finite maps 
     from <a href="ACL2____BYTE-LIST32.html">byte arrays of length 32</a> 
     to <a href="ACL2____BYTE-LIST.html">byte arrays</a>, 
     based on the fixtype of <a href="OMAP____OMAPS.html">omaps</a>.</p>
