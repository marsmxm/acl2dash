<p>This is used in the special case where we know that we want to 
match exactly one (perhaps optional) <span class="v">property_actual_arg</span> followed by a 
right paren, e.g., we are matching <span class="v">bar</span> in <span class="v">.foo(bar)</span> or similar.</p> 
 
<p>The basic grammar rule here is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">property_actual_arg ::= property_expr
                      | sequence_actual_arg

sequence_actual_arg ::= event_expression
                      | sequence_expr</pre> 
 
<p>We don't really distinguish between <span class="v">property_expr</span> and 
<span class="v">sequence_expr</span>.  But even without the vast ambiguity between them, this is 
also ambiguous in a couple of ways.</p> 
 
<p>First, any ordinary expression is simultaneously an <span class="v">event_expression</span> 
and also a <span class="v">sequence_expr</span>, e.g., via <span class="v">expression_or_dist</span>.  So if we 
just see an identifier like <span class="v">foo</span> or some other expression, it may be an 
event expression or a sequence expression, and it isn't clear what we should 
prefer.  Furthermore, the keyword <span class="v">or</span> makes it so that an event expression 
such as <span class="v">a or b</span> might instead be interpreted as a sequence expression.</p> 
 
<p>In the special case where we know that we're expecting a single 
<span class="v">property_actual_arg</span> followed by a right-paren, e.g., <span class="v">.foo(bar)</span>, it 
seems fairly reasonable to just use backtracking to try both possibilities and 
see which (if any) leads us to the right place.  If both succeed, e.g., perhaps 
<span class="v">bar</span> is an ordinary expression, we arbitrarily choose to prefer a 
<span class="v">property_expr</span> over an <span class="v">event_expression</span>.</p>
