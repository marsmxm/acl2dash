<p>Regenerate the tau database relative to the current enabled theory</p><pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____REGENERATE-TAU-DATABASE.html">regenerate-tau-database</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>The tau database is regenerated by scanning the current logical world and 
 re-processing every rule-generating event in it relative to the current 
 enabled theory and current tau auto mode settings.  See <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-TAU-SYSTEM.html">introduction-to-the-tau-system</a> for background details.</p> 
 
 <p>This command was intended to allow the user to remove a fact from the tau 
 database, by regenerating the database without the fact.  But as the following 
 discussion highlights, <span class="v">regenerate-tau-database</span> does not really solve the 
 problem.  We regard it as a placeholder for a more sophisticated mechanism. 
 However, we have trouble understanding why a user might wish to remove a fact 
 from the database and are awaiting further user experiences before designing 
 the more sophisticated mechanism.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose, for example, that you wanted to remove a signature rule provided 
 by some rule with name <i>rune</i>.  You could disable <i>rune</i> and 
 regenerate the database.  We discuss why you might — or might not 
 — want to do this later.  But suppose you did it.  Unfortunately, the 
 database you get will not be just like the one you started with minus the 
 signature rule.  The reason is that the database you started with was 
 generated incrementally and the current theory might have evolved.  To take a 
 simple example, your starting database might have included a rule that has 
 been disabled since it was first added.  Thus, the part of your starting 
 database built before the disabling was constructed with the rule enabled and 
 the part built afterwards has the rule disabled.  You are unlikely to get the 
 same database whether you enable or disable that rule now.</p> 
 
 <p>You might hope that the avoidance of <span class="v">in-theory</span> events would eliminate 
 the problem but it does not because even the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a></span> theory is 
 constructed incrementally from the ``pre-history'' commands used to boot up 
 ACL2.  Those pre-history commands include some global <span class="v">in-theory</span> commands. 
 Since every session starts from the <span class="v">ground-zero</span> state, the starting 
 database is already ``infected'' with global <span class="v">in-theory</span> commands.</p> 
 
 <p>The reason we hope that it will not be necessary to remove tau facts is 
 that the tau system is designed merely to be fast and benign (see <i>Design 
 Philosophy</i> in <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-TAU-SYSTEM.html">introduction-to-the-tau-system</a>).  The tau system's 
 coverage should grows monotonically with the addition of rules.  According to 
 this understanding of tau, adding a signature rule, for example, may allow tau 
 to prove some additional goals but will not prevent it from proving goals it 
 could prove previously.  If this is understanding of tau is accurate, we see 
 no fundamental reason to support the removal of a fact.  This, of course, 
 ignores the possibility that the user wishes to explore alternative proof 
 strategies or measure performance.</p> 
 
 <p>We welcome user observations and experience on this issue.</p>
