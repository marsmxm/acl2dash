<p>Define a (possibly recursive) sum of products type.</p> 
<h3>Caveat</h3> 
 
<p><span class="v">Defflexsum</span> is not very user-friendly or automatic; it is easy to create 
instances that fail in incomprehensible ways.  It is used as a backend to 
define the <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> and <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a> type generators, which are easier to 
use.</p> 
 
<h4>Example</h4> 
 
<p>This is essentially the same as the example in <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a>.  Logically, 
the way these types work are very similar; only the representation is 
different.</p>

<p>Note: when the constructors are actually defined, <span class="v">mbe</span> is used to allow 
the function to logically apply fixing functions to its arguments without a 
performance penalty when running with guards checked.</p> 
 
<h3>More on the above Caveat</h3> 
 
<p><span class="v">defflexsum</span> is less automatic than most other type-defining utilities. 
It requires certain information to be provided by the user that must then be 
proved to be self-consistent.  For example, the <span class="v">:ctor-body</span> argument in a 
product spec determines how that product is constructed, and the <span class="v">:acc-body</span> 
argument to a product field spec determines how that field is accessed.  These 
could easily be inconsistent, or the <span class="v">:ctor-body</span> could produce an object 
that is not recognized as that product.  If either of these is the case, some 
proof within the <span class="v">defflexsum</span> event will fail and it will be up to the user 
to figure out what that proof was and why it failed.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Syntax and Options</h3> 
 
<h4>
<span class="v">Defflexsum</span> top-level arguments</h4> 
 
<p><span class="v">Defflexsum</span> takes the following keyword arguments, in addition to a list 
of products, which are described further below.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:pred</span>, <span class="v">:fix</span>, <span class="v">:equiv</span>, <span class="v">:kind</span>, <span class="v">:case</span>, and <span class="v">:count</span> 
override the default names for the various generated functions (and case 
macro).  If any of these is not provided, a default name is used instead.  If 
<span class="v">:kind nil</span> is provided, then no <span class="v">-kind</span> function is generated and 
instead the products are distinguished by their bare <span class="v">:cond</span> fields.  If 
<span class="v">:count nil</span> is provided, then no count function is defined for this 
type.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:xvar</span> sets the variable name used to represent the SUM object.  By 
default, we look for a symbol whose name is "X" that occurs in the product 
declarations.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:measure</span> provides the measure for the predicate, fixing function, and 
count function.  It defaults to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> x)</span>, which is usually 
appropriate for stand-alone products, but sometimes a special measure must be 
used, especially when <span class="v">defflexsum</span> is used inside a mutually-recursive 
<span class="v">deftypes</span> form.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:prepwork</span> is a list of events to be submitted at the beginning of the 
process; usually these are local lemmas needed for the various proofs.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:parents</span>, <span class="v">:short</span>, and <span class="v">:long</span> provide xdoc for the type</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:inline</span>: sets default for inlining of products and determines whether 
the kind and fixing functions are inlined.  This may be <span class="v">:all</span> or a subset 
of <span class="v">(:kind :fix :acc :xtor)</span>, defaulting to <span class="v">(:kind :fix :acc)</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h4>Products</h4> 
 
<p>Each product starts with a keyword naming its kind; this is the symbol that 
the SUM kind function returns on an object of that product type.  The rest of 
the form is a list of keyword arguments:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:cond</span> describes how to tell whether an object is of this product type. 
To determine the kind of a SUM object, the SUM kind function checks each of 
the product conditions in turn, returning the name of the first matching 
condition.  So the condition for a given product assumes the negations of the 
conditions of the previous listed products.  The <span class="v">:cond</span> field defaults to 
<span class="v">t</span>, so typically it can be left off the last product type.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:shape</span> adds well-formedness requirements for a product.  One purpose 
these may serve is to make well-formed objects canonical: it must be a theorem 
that the fixing function applied to a well-formed object is the same object. 
So if a product is (e.g.) a tuple represented as a list, and the constructor 
creates it as a true-list, then there should be a requirement that the object 
be a true-list of the appropriate length; otherwise, an object that had a 
non-nil final cdr would be recognized as well-formed, but fix to a different 
value.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:fields</span> list the fields of the product; these are described further 
below.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:ctor-body</span> describes how to make a product object from the fields. 
This must be consistent with the field accessor bodies (described below) and 
with the <span class="v">:cond</span> and <span class="v">:shape</span> fields of this product and the previous 
ones (i.e., it can't produce something that could be mistaken for one of the 
previous products listed).  The actual constructor function will have fixing 
functions added; these should not be present in the <span class="v">:ctor-body</span> 
argument.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:type-name</span> overrides the type-name, which by default is 
<span class="v">[SUMNAME]-[KIND]</span>, e.g. <span class="v">arithterm-plus</span> from the example above.  This 
is used as a base for generating the field accessor names.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:ctor-name</span> overrides the name of the product constructor function, 
which by default is the type-name.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:inline</span>, determining whether the constructor and accessors are inlined 
or not.  This may be <span class="v">:all</span> or a subset of <span class="v">(:xtor :acc)</span>.  Defaults to 
<span class="v">(:acc)</span> if not overridden.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:require</span> adds a dependent type requirement; see the section on this 
feature in <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h4>Product Fields</h4> 
 
<p>Each product field is a name followed by a keyword list, in which the 
following keywords are allowed:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">:acc-body</span> must be present: a term showing how to fetch the field from 
the object.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">:acc-name</span> overrides the accessor name</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">:type</span>, the type (fixtype name or predicate) of the field; may be empty 
for an untyped field</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">:default</span>, the default value of the field in the constructor macro</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">:doc</span> will eventually generate xdoc, but is currently ignored</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">:rule-classes</span>, the rule classes for the return type of the accessor 
function.  This is <span class="v">:rewrite</span> by default; you may wish to change it to 
<span class="v">:type-prescription</span> when the type is something basic like 
<span class="v">integerp</span>.</li> 
</ul>
