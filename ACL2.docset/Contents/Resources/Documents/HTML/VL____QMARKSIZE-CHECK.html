<p>Check the sizes of conditional expression tests.</p><p>This is a heuristic for generating warnings.</p> 
 
<p>We think it would be strange to see an expression like <span class="v">A ? B : C</span> where 
<span class="v">A</span> is not one bit wide.  It found a few minor things that we were able to 
clean up, but nothing that was really a bug.</p> 
 
<p>Since the <span class="v">?:</span> operator has the lowest precedence, expressions like <span class="v">A
&amp; B ? C : D</span> are parsed as <span class="v">(A &amp; B) ? C : D</span>, which might not be what is 
intended.  In some cases, an actual precedence problem might be revealed by 
seeing that the size of the test expression isn't 1.</p>
