<h2>Abstract From Paper</h2> 
 
<p> We present a mechanically-verified proof checker developed with the ACL2 
theorem-proving system that is general enough to support the growing variety of 
increasingly complex satisfiability (SAT) solver techniques, including those 
based on extended resolution.  A common approach to assure the correctness of 
SAT solvers is to emit a proof of unsatisfiability when no solution is reported 
to exist.  Contemporary proof checkers only check logical equivalence using 
resolution-style inference.  However, some state-of-the-art, conflict-driven 
clause-learning SAT solvers use preprocessing, inprocessing, and learning 
techniques, that cannot be checked solely by resolution-style inference.  We 
have developed a mechanically-verified proof checker that assures refutation 
clauses preserve satisfiability.  We believe our approach is sufficiently 
expressive to validate all known SAT-solver techniques.</p>
