<p>ACL2 Version  3.2(r) (April, 2007) Notes</p><p>Changed the default distributed <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> directory for ACL2(r) 
 from <span class="v">books/</span> to <span class="v">books/nonstd/</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>, in 
 particular the discussion of ``Distributed Books Directory''.</p> 
 
 <p>Added directory <span class="v">books/arithmetic-3/</span> and its subdirectories to 
 <span class="v">books/nonstd/</span>.  (But a chunk of theorems from 
 <span class="v">arithmetic-3/extra/ext.lisp</span> are ``commented out'' using 
 #-:non-standard-analysis because they depend on <span class="v">books/rtl/rel7/</span>, which is 
 not yet in <span class="v">books/nonstd/</span>; feel free to volunteer to remedy this!)</p> 
 
 <p>Incorporated changes from Ruben Gamboa to some (linear and non-linear) 
 arithmetic routines in the theorem prover, to comprehend the reals rather than 
 only the rationals.</p> 
 
 <p>Please also see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-3-2.html">note-3-2</a> for changes to Version 3.2 of ACL2.</p>
