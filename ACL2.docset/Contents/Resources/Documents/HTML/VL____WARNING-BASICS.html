<p>General introduction to <a href="VL____VL-WARNING.html">vl-warning</a> objects and error handling 
in VL.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>Many parts of VL can run into situations where we want to issue a warning or 
cause an error.  For instance:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Our <a href="VL____LOADER.html">loader</a> could encounter syntax that is simply malformed, or it 
could run into a construct that is legal but that we don't support yet.  It 
could also notice valid but strange cases, e.g., <span class="v">4'd16</span> is well-defined but 
weird because 16 doesn't fit in 4 bits.</li> 
 
<li>Our <a href="VL____TRANSFORMS.html">transforms</a> might run into semantically ill-formed constructs, 
e.g., perhaps a module declares <span class="v">wire [3:0] foo</span> and then later declares 
<span class="v">integer foo</span>, or perhaps we are trying to instantiate a module that is not 
defined.</li> 
 
<li>Our <a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a> checks might notice "code smells" where even though 
the input Verilog is semantically well-formed, it is somehow strange and looks 
like it could be an error.  For instance, perhaps there are multiple 
assignments to the same wire, or expressions like <span class="v">a &amp; b</span> where <span class="v">a</span> and 
<span class="v">b</span> have different sizes.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Handling these many kinds of cases is tricky.  In the earliest days of VL, 
our approach to warnings and errors was quite ad-hoc.  We sometimes printed 
warning messages to standard output using the <a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> function.  For more 
serious conditions, we sometimes caused errors using <a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a>.  This ad-hoc 
approach had a number of problems.  In particular,</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>It led us to see many of the same warnings repeatedly because our various 
well-formedness checks were run many times on the same modules in different 
stages of the translation.</li> 
 
<li>For some warnings, we did not particularly care about the individual 
instances of the warning.  For instance, unless we're interested in fixing the 
"if" statements to be ?: instead, we don't want to be told about each 
occurrence of an if statement.  We just want a higher-level note that hey, 
there are 30 if-statements to clean up.</li> 
 
<li>The warnings were not "attached" in any way to the modules that they were 
actually about.  Practically speaking, this might mean that users might not 
even see the warnings that had been generated for the modules they are working 
on.</li> 
 
<li>There is no way to recover form an error created with <a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a>, so if we 
ran into some bad problem with a particular module, it could actually prevent 
us from translating <i>any</i> of the modules.  This was particularly 
troublesome because Verilog is such a large language that, especially in the 
beginning, we often ran into constructs that we did not yet support.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>These sorts of problems quickly led us to want a more coherent, global 
approach to dealing with warnings and errors.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Warning Objects</h3> 
 
<p>Our new approach to warning and error handling centers around explicit <a href="VL____VL-WARNING.html">vl-warning</a> objects.  These objects are in many ways similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling" target="_blank"><nobr>Exception<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exception_handling"></nobr></a> objects 
found in other programming languages.  Each warning has a <b>type</b> and a 
<b>message</b> that describes the error.  These messages can conveniently make 
use of VL's <a href="VL____PRINTER.html">printer</a>, so you can directly pretty-print arbitrary Verilog 
constructs when writing warning messages.</p> 
 
<p>We use <a href="VL____VL-WARNING.html">vl-warning</a> objects universally, for all kinds of warnings and 
errors.  That is, everything from the most minor of code smells (e.g., <span class="v">wire
foo</span> is never used for anything), to the most severe problems (e.g., the 
module you're instantiating isn't defined) results in a warning.  To 
distinguish minor oddities from severe problems, our warning objects include a 
<b>fatalp</b> field.</p> 
 
<p>As a general philosophy or strategy for using these warning objects:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Warning messages should never be printed to standard output.  Instead, we 
should create a <a href="VL____VL-WARNING-P.html">vl-warning-p</a> object that provides context and explains 
the problem as clearly and concisely as possible.</li> 
 
<li>Errors should not cause sudden, unrecoverable exits.  That is, <a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a> 
should never be used for warnings that could plausibly be triggered by 
malformed Verilog.  (However, it <i>is</i> reasonable to use <span class="v">er</span> in an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)" target="_blank"><nobr>assert<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assertion_(software_development)"></nobr></a>-like 
fashion, to rule out programming problems that we believe are impossible.)</li> 
 
<li>Non-fatal warnings should be used for any issues that are purely stylistic, 
"code smells," etc., such as linter-like checks.</li> 
 
<li>Fatal warnings should be used for any issues that are truly errors.  For 
instance: malformed syntax, conflicting declarations of some name, references 
to undefined modules, etc.</li> 
 
<li>Fatal warnings may also be used when a transform encounters constructs that 
are valid but not supported, e.g., because we have simply not yet spent the 
time to implement them.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h3>Accumulating Warnings</h3> 
 
<p>Warning objects are simple enough to understand, but what do we actually 
<i>do</i> with them?  We adopt another general principle:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Every warning object should be associated with the top-level design 
elements (e.g., module, package, interface, etc.) where it was caused.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This approach allows us to easily do many practically useful things with the 
warnings.  For instance, it lets us easily filter out any modules that have 
fatal warnings; see <a href="VL____PROPAGATING-ERRORS.html">propagating-errors</a>.  As another example, we can 
create reports such as a <a href="VL____VL-REPORTCARD.html">vl-reportcard</a> that summarize the warnings in 
our design.  These kinds of capabilities are especially useful in tools like 
<a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Practically implementing this philosophy is slightly tricky.</p> 
 
<p>Deep within some particular transform, we might encounter something that is 
wrong and decide to issue a warning.  In a typical object-oriented programming 
language, this would be trivial: our module class might have an 
<span class="v">add-warning</span> that (destructively) adds a new warning to the module.</p> 
 
<p>But our programming language is truly functional, so we cannot modify 
existing modules.  Instead, whenever some subsidiary function wants to produce 
a warning, its caller must take measures to ensure that the warning is 
eventually added to the appropriate module.</p> 
 
<p>Our usual approach is to add a <b>warnings accumulator</b> as an argument to 
our functions.  Typically this argument should be named <span class="v">warnings</span>. 
Functions that take a warnings accumulator return the (possibly extended) 
accumulator as one of their return values.  Macros like <a href="VL____OK.html">ok</a>, <a href="VL____WARN.html">warn</a> 
and <a href="VL____FATAL.html">fatal</a> can assist with implementing this convention.</p> 
 
<p>At a high level, then, a function that transforms a top-level design 
element, e.g., a module, begins by obtaining the current warnings for the 
module.  Using these warnings as the initial accumulator, it calls its 
subsidiary helpers to carry out its work.  This work transforms various parts 
of the module, and meanwhile the warnings are perhaps extended.  Finally, the 
function returns a new <a href="VL____VL-MODULE-P.html">vl-module-p</a> which is updated with the extended 
list of warnings.</p>
