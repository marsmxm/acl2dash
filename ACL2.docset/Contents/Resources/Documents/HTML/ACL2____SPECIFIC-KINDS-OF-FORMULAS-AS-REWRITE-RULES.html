<p>Advice about how to handle commonly occurring formulas as rewrite rules</p><p>Below we give you some guidelines for handling specific, commonly 
 occurring situations.</p> 
 
 <p>* <b>Associativity</b>: If a function <span class="v">f</span> is associative, prove</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f (f x y) z) (f x (f y z)))</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 will use this to flatten <span class="v">f</span>-nests ``to the right.''</p> 
 
 <p>* <b>Commutativity</b>: If a function <span class="v">f</span> is commutative, prove both</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f x y) (f y x))</pre> 
 
 <p>and</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f x (f y z)) (f y (f x z)))</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2's heuristics will use these rules to order the arguments 
 alphabetically, so that <span class="v">(f B (f D (f A C)))</span> becomes <span class="v">(f A (f B (f C
 D)))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>* <b>Distributivity</b>: If you have a pair of functions <span class="v">f</span> and <span class="v">g</span> 
 so that <span class="v">(f x (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> y z))</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (f x y) (f x z))</span> or some other form of 
 distributivity is provable, arrange your rules to move the lighter function 
 symbol up and the heavier one toward the variable symbols.  For example, our 
 arithmetic libraries drive multiplication through addition, producing sums of 
 products rather than products of sums.</p> 
 
 <p>* <b>Identity and Other Laws</b>: Prove the obvious identity and zero laws 
 (or at least anticipate that you might need them down the road) so as to 
 eliminate operators.</p> 
 
 <p>* <b>Get Rid of Tail Recursive Functions</b>: A corollary to the above 
 advice concerns tail recursive functions that use auxiliary variables.  New 
 users often define concepts using tail recursions, accumulating partial 
 results in auxiliary variables, because creating such functions is similar to 
 programming with <span class="v">while</span> loops.  Expert users will use tail recursion when 
 necessary for execution efficiency.  But tail recursive functions are messy to 
 reason about: their auxiliary variables have to be properly initialized to 
 make the functions compute the expected results, but to state inductively 
 provable properties of tail recursive functions you must identify the 
 invariants on those auxiliary variables.  This problem tends not to happen 
 with <i>primitive recursive functions</i>.  A primitive recursive function is 
 one that recurs down one variable and holds all the other variables constant 
 in recursion.  Most tail-recursive functions can be written elegantly as 
 primitive recursive functions, though one might have to ignore the 
 programmer's desire to make things efficient and define auxiliary functions to 
 appropriately transform the value returned by the recursive call.  The classic 
 example is reverse defined in terms of the auxiliary function <span class="v">append</span> 
 versus reverse defined tail recursively with an accumulator.  By introducing 
 <span class="v">append</span> you introduce a concept about which you can state lemmas and 
 decompose the proofs of properties of reverse.  So if your problem involves 
 tail recursive functions with auxiliary variables, define the primitive 
 recursive version, prove that the tail recursive function is equivalent to the 
 primitive recursive one, and arrange the rewrite rule to eliminate the tail 
 recursive function.</p> 
 
 <p>* <b>Get Rid of Mutually Recursive Functions</b>: Similarly, if you have 
 used <span class="v">mutual-recursion</span> to introduce a clique of mutually recursive 
 functions, <span class="v">f1</span>, <span class="v">f2</span>, ..., you will find that to reason about any one 
 function in the nest you have to reason about all of them.  Any mutually 
 recursive function can be defined in a singly recursive way.  So do that and 
 then prove a rewrite rule that gets rid of all the mutually recursive 
 functions by proving</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f1 ...) (g1 ...))
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f2 ...) (g2 ...))
     ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>where the <span class="v">gi</span> are singly recursive.  You may need to appeal to a trick 
 to define the <span class="v">gi</span>: define a singly recursive function that takes a flag 
 argument and mimics whichever mutually recursive function the flag specifies.
