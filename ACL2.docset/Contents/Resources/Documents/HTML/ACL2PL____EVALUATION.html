<p>Evaluation.</p><p>The evaluation semantics of ACL2 is formalized here 
     in terms of a succession of the evaluation states 
     formalized by the fixtype <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2PL____EVAL-STATE.html">eval-state</a></span>. 
     This is a small-step operational semantics, 
     from which we could also define a big-step operational semantics 
     (by composing the small steps).</p><p>A small-step semantics is more flexible than a big-step semantics, 
     because it lets us talk about intermediate evaluation states, 
     and not just the final states. 
     This is particularly important to describe non-terminating executions. 
     Also, we can easily derive a big-step semantics from a small-step one, 
     but not vice versa.</p><p>There are different options for the granularity of the (small) steps. 
     The granularity that we formalize here should be adequate, 
     but it can be changed if needed or useful.</p>
