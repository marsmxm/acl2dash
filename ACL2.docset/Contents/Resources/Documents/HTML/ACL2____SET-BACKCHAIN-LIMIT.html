<p>Sets the backchain-limit used by the type-set and rewriting mechanisms</p><p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so 
 recorded.  Moreover, its effect is to set the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, and 
 hence its effect is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to the book or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form 
 containing it; see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>This event sets the global <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a></span> used by the ACL2 
 type-set and rewriting mechanisms.  Its value may be a cons whose car and cdr 
 are each either <span class="v">nil</span> or a non-negative integer.  Its value <span class="v">x</span> may also 
 be <span class="v">nil</span> or a non-negative integer, which is treated as a cons whose car 
 and cdr are both <span class="v">x</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The car is used to limit backchaining used by the ACL2 type-set mechanism, 
 while the cdr is used to limit backchaining used by the rewriting mechanism. 
 See <a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> for details about how backchain-limits are used. 
 Rewrite backchain limits may also be installed at the level of hints; see 
 <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> for a discussion of <span class="v">:backchain-limit-rw</span>.</p>
