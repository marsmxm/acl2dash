<p>Indicator of how an argument is used</p><p>The <i>ilk</i> of the ith argument of a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span>d function 
  symbol <span class="v">fn</span> is one of three tokens with the following meanings.</p> 
 
  <ul> 
 
  <li>
<span class="v">:FN</span> - the ith argument is used exclusively as a function object by 
  <span class="v">fn</span>; informally this means that the argument is passed only into slots of 
  ilk <span class="v">:FN</span> in the definition of <span class="v">fn</span> and that on some (syntactic) 
  execution paths reaches the first argument of a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>.</li> 
 
  <li>
<span class="v">:EXPR</span> - the ith argument is used exclusively as a expression object 
  by <span class="v">fn</span>; informally this means that the argument is passed only into slots 
  of ilk <span class="v">:EXPR</span> in the definition of <span class="v">fn</span> and that on some (syntactic) 
  execution paths reaches the first argument of a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EV_42.html">ev$</a></span>.</li> 
 
  <li>
<span class="v">NIL</span> - the ith argument is never used as a function or expression 
  object in the definition of <span class="v">fn</span>.</li> 
 
  </ul> 
 
  <p>See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> for more details.</p> 
 
  <p>The <i>ilks</i> of all the arguments of <span class="v">fn</span> are stored in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> of <span class="v">fn</span>.  If each ilk of <span class="v">fn</span> is <span class="v">NIL</span> the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> 
  stores a <span class="v">T</span> as the ``list'' of ilks.</p> 
 
  <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> of <span class="v">fn</span> is computed by a successful call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span> on <span class="v">fn</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>Ilks are used by the various notions of <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a>ness controlling 
  whether <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EV_42.html">ev$</a></span> can properly interpret a quoted 
  function or expression object.</p>
