<p>Introduce an <a href="CRYPTO____INTERFACES.html">interface</a> for a cryptographic block encryption function.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>A cryptographic block encryption function 
     turns a block of plaintext into a block of ciphertext, given a key. 
     Its inverse, a cryptographic block decryption function, 
     turns a block of ciphertext into a block of plaintext, given the same key. 
     Blocks and keys have known sizes in bits. 
     Given an endianness convention to covert between bit and byte sequences, 
     the encryption and decryption functions can be regarded as 
     operating on byte sequences instead of bit sequences.</p><p>This macro introduces weakly constrained ACL2 functions 
     for two pairs of cryptographic block encryption and decryption functions: 
     one that operates on bits and one that operates on bytes. 
     Each of these four functions takes as inputs a key and a block, 
     and has a guard requiring them to be bit or byte lists 
     of the right key and block sizes. 
     These functions are constrained to return blocks of the right sizes, 
     and also to fix their inputs to bit or byte lists. 
     We may extend this macro to generate additional constraints, 
     such as the fact that encryption and decryption are mutual inverses.</p><p>This macro also introduces a few theorems 
     that follow from the constraints. 
     It also introduces an XDOC topic for the generated 
     functions, constraints, and theorems.</p><h3>General Form</h3><pre class="code">(<a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-ENCRYPT-BLOCK.html">definterface-encrypt-block</a> name
