<p>(macro) 
print the hypotheses</p><pre class="code">Examples:
hyps               -- print all (<a href="ACL2____TOP-LEVEL.html">top-level</a>) hypotheses
(hyps (1 3) (2 4)) -- print hypotheses 1 and 3 and governors 2 and 4
(hyps (1 3) t)     -- print hypotheses 1 and 3 and all governors

General Form:
(hyps &amp;optional hyps-indices govs-indices)</pre> 
 
 <p>Print the indicated top-level hypotheses and governors.  (The notion of 
 ``governors'' is defined below.)  Here, <span class="v">hyps-indices</span> and 
 <span class="v">govs-indices</span> should be lists of indices of hypotheses and governors 
 (respectively), except that the atom <span class="v">t</span> may be used to indicate that one 
 wants all hypotheses or governors (respectively).</p> 
 
 <p>The list of ``governors'' is defined as follows.  Actually, we define here 
 the notion of the governors for a pair of the form <span class="v">&lt;term</span>, address&gt;]; 
 we're interested in the special case where the term is the conclusion and the 
 address is the current address.  If the address is <span class="v">nil</span>, then there are no 
 governors, i.e., the list of governors is <span class="v">nil</span>.  If the term is of the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> x y z)</span> and the address is of the form <span class="v">(2 . rest)</span> or <span class="v">(3
 . rest)</span>, then the list of governors is the result of <span class="v">cons</span>ing <span class="v">x</span> or 
 its negation (respectively) onto the list of governors for the pair <span class="v">&lt;y,
 rest&gt;</span> or the pair <span class="v">&lt;z, rest&gt;</span> (respectively).  If the term is of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> x y)</span> and the address is of the form <span class="v">(2 . rest)</span>, then the 
 list of governors is the result of <span class="v">cons</span>ing <span class="v">x</span> onto the list of 
 governors for the pair <span class="v">&lt;y, rest&gt;</span>.  Otherwise, the list of governors for 
 the pair <span class="v">&lt;term, (n .  rest)&gt;</span> is exactly the list of governors for the 
 pair <span class="v">&lt;argn, rest&gt;</span> where <span class="v">argn</span> is the <span class="v">n</span>th argument of 
 <span class="v">term</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If all goals have been proved, a message saying so will be printed.  (as 
 there will be no current hypotheses or governors!).</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">hyps</span> command never causes an error.  It ``succeeds'' (in fact its 
 value is <span class="v">t</span>) if the arguments (when supplied) are appropriate, i.e. 
 either <span class="v">t</span> or lists of indices of hypotheses or governors, respectively. 
 Otherwise it ``fails'' (its value is <span class="v">nil</span>).</p>
