<p>Attempting to relieve the hypotheses of a rule</p><p>When the theorem prover attempts to apply a rule (e.g., a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule), it must relieve (prove) the hypotheses of that rule.  In the 
  ACL2 community, this process of relieving hypotheses is called 
  backchaining.</p> 
 
  <p>There is no such thing as a backchaining or backward-chaining rule 
  class (see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>) in ACL2.</p>
