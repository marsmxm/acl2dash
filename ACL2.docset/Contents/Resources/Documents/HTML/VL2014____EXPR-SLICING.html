<p>Functions for slicing up expressions into bits or segments.</p><p>We say a Verilog expression <span class="v">x</span> is <b>sliceable</b> when it may 
be "easily" converted into a concatenation, say <span class="v">{ bit_N, bit_N-1, ...,
bit0 }</span>, where each <span class="v">bit_i</span> is either a one-bit wide constant (i.e., 
<span class="v">1'b0</span>, <span class="v">1'b1</span>, <span class="v">1'bX</span>, or <span class="v">1'bZ</span>), or is a bit-select from a plain 
identifier (i.e., <span class="v">foo[3]</span>).</p> 
 
<p>Sliceable expressions are of interest because they can be easily partitioned 
into lists of individual bits or broken into segments, without having to 
introduce any temporary wires.</p> 
 
<p><span class="tt">(vl-expr-sliceable-p x)</span> recognizes the expressions we regard as 
sliceble.  For the atoms, we allow:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-CONSTINT-P.html">Constant</a> integers,</li> 
 <li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-WEIRDINT-P.html">Weird</a> integers, and</li> 
 <li><a href="VL2014____VL-ID-P.html">Identifiers</a></li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>We do not currently consider <a href="VL2014____VL-REAL-P.html">real 
numbers</a> or <a href="VL2014____VL-STRING-P.html">strings</a> to be sliceable, 
but in principle we could add support for this.  It doesn't make sense to 
regard the other kinds of atoms (HID pieces, function names, and system 
function names) as sliceable.</p> 
 
<p>Beyond these atoms, we regard resolved bit- and part-selects from 
identifiers as sliceable.  It is pretty obvious that the indicies of a 
part-select need to be resolved for easy partitioning.  But even though we know 
that <span class="v">foo[i]</span> is only a single-bit wide, we also insist that bit selects be 
resolved because this is useful in functions like <a href="VL2014____VL-MSB-BITSLICE-EXPR.html">vl-msb-bitslice-expr</a> 
which convert sliceable expressions into actual lists of bits, and also in 
<a href="VL2014____VL-ASSIGN-OCCFORM.html">vl-assign-occform</a> where we assume we can just use plain assignments on 
any sliceable expressions.</p> 
 
<p>We say that concatenations of sliceable arguments as sliceable, as are 
replications of sliceable arguments with resolved multiplicities.</p> 
 
<p>Other expressions aren't sliceable.  This seems generally sensible, e.g., 
what are the bits of <span class="v">a + b</span>?  With enough context it would be possible to 
slice up hierarchical identifiers, but we don't try to do this since it would 
be quite a bit more complex.</p>
