<p>Define a not-to-be-inlined function symbol and associated macro</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-INLINE.html">defun-inline</a> for an analogous utility that supports 
 inlining.  The present utility is probably far less useful; it tells the 
 compiler <i>not</i> to inline calls of the function being defined.  Also see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFUND-NOTINLINE.html">defund-notinline</a> for a variant of this event that disables the 
 newly-defined function symbol.</p> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-INLINE.html">defun-inline</a> f ...)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NOTINLINE.html">defun-notinline</a> f ...)</span> 
 cause evaluation of Common Lisp forms <span class="v">(declaim (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INLINE.html">inline</a> f$inline))</span> and 
 <span class="v">(declaim (notinline f$notinline))</span>, respectively.  According to the Common 
 Lisp spec, the compiler need not respect the first of these (for <span class="v">inline</span>), 
 but it must respect the second of these (for <span class="v">notinline</span>).  Fortunately, 
 Common Lisp implementations often do respect the first of these as well.</p>
