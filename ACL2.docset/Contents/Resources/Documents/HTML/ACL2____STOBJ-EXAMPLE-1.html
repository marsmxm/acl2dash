<p>An example of the use of single-threaded objects</p><p>Suppose we want to sweep a tree and (1) count the number of 
 interior nodes, (2) count the number of tips and (3) keep a record of every 
 tip we encounter that is an integer.  We could use a single-threaded object as 
 our ``accumulator''.  Such an object would have three fields, one holding the 
 number of nodes seen so far, one holding the number of tips, and one holding 
 all the integer tips seen.</p> 
 
 <p>The following event declares <span class="v">counters</span> to be a single-threaded 
 object.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> counters
  (NodeCnt     :type integer :initially 0)
  (TipCnt      :type integer :initially 0)
  (IntTipsSeen :type t       :initially nil))</pre> 
 
 <p>It has three fields, <span class="v">NodeCnt</span>, <span class="v">TipCnt</span>, and <span class="v">IntTipsSeen</span>.  (As 
 always in ACL2, capitalization is irrelevant in simple symbol names, so the 
 first name could be written <span class="v">nodecnt</span> or <span class="v">NODECNT</span>, etc.) Those are the 
 name of the accessor functions for the object.  The corresponding update 
 functions are named <span class="v">update-NodeCnt</span>, <span class="v">update-TipCnt</span> and 
 <span class="v">update-IntTipsSeen</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If you do not like the default function names chosen above, there is a 
 feature in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> event that allows you to specify other 
 names.</p> 
 
 <p>If you want to see the ACL2 definitions of all the functions defined by 
 this event, look at <a href="ACL2____STOBJ-EXAMPLE-1-DEFUNS.html">stobj-example-1-defuns</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>If, after this event, we evaluate the top-level ``global variable'' 
 <span class="v">counters</span> in the ACL2 read-eval-print loop we get:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;counters
&lt;counters&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that the value printed is ``<span class="v">&lt;counters&gt;</span>''.  Actually, the value of 
 <span class="v">counters</span> in the logic is <span class="v">(0 0 NIL)</span>.  But ACL2 always prints 
 single-threaded objects in this non-informative way because they are usually 
 so big that to do otherwise would be unpleasant.</p> 
 
 <p>Had you tried to evaluate the ``global variable'' <span class="v">counters</span> before 
 declaring it a single-threaded object, ACL2 would have complained that it does 
 not support global variables.  So a lesson here is that once you have declared 
 a new single-threaded object your top-level forms can reference it.  In 
 versions of ACL2 prior to Version 2.4 the only variable enjoying this status 
 was <span class="v">STATE</span>.  single-threaded objects are a straightforward generalization 
 of the long-implemented von Neumann <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> feature of ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>We can access the fields of <span class="v">counters</span> as with:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(NodeCnt counters)
0
ACL2 !&gt;(IntTipsSeen counters)
NIL</pre> 
 
 <p>and we can set the fields of <span class="v">counters</span> as with:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(update-NodeCnt 3 counters)
&lt;counters&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(NodeCnt counters)
3</pre> 
 
 <p>Observe that when we evaluate an expression that returns a counter object, 
 that object becomes the ``current value'' of <span class="v">counters</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is a function that ``converts'' the <span class="v">counters</span> object to its 
 ``ordinary'' representation:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> show-counters (counters)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (counters)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (NodeCnt counters)
        (TipCnt counters)
        (IntTipsSeen counters)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Observe that we <i>must</i> declare, at the top of the <span class="v">defun</span>, that we 
 mean to use the formal parameter <span class="v">counters</span> as a single-threaded object! 
 If we did not make this declaration, the body of <span class="v">show-counters</span> would be 
 processed as though <span class="v">counters</span> were an ordinary object.  An error would be 
 caused because the accessors used above cannot be applied to anything but the 
 single-threaded object <span class="v">counters</span>.  If you want to know why we insist on 
 this declaration, see <a href="ACL2____DECLARE-STOBJS.html">declare-stobjs</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">show-counters</span> is admitted, the following message is printed:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Since SHOW-COUNTERS is non-recursive, its admission is trivial.  We
observe that the type of SHOW-COUNTERS is described by the theorem
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> (SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS))
     (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">TRUE-LISTP</a> (SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS))).
We used primitive type reasoning.

(SHOW-COUNTERS COUNTERS) =&gt; *.

The guard conjecture for SHOW-COUNTERS is trivial to prove.
SHOW-COUNTERS is compliant with Common Lisp.</pre> 
 
 <p>The line above containing the ``=&gt;'' is called the ``signature'' of 
 <span class="v">show-counters</span>; it conveys the information that the first argument is the 
 single-threaded object <span class="v">counters</span> and the only result is an ordinary 
 object.  Here is an example of another signature:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(PROCESSOR * * COUNTERS) =&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">MV</a> * COUNTERS)</pre> 
 
 <p>which indicates that the function <span class="v">PROCESSOR</span> (which we haven't shown 
 you) takes three arguments, the third of which is the <span class="v">COUNTERS</span> stobj, and 
 returns two results, the second of which is the modified <span class="v">COUNTERS</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Returning to the admission of <span class="v">show-counters</span> above, the last sentence 
 printed indicates that the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span> conjectures for the function were 
 proved.  When some argument of a function is declared to be a single-threaded 
 object via the <span class="v">xargs</span>, <span class="v">:stobjs</span>, we automatically add (conjoin) to the 
 guard the condition that the argument satisfy the recognizer for that 
 single-threaded object.  In the case of <span class="v">show-counters</span> the guard is 
 <span class="v">(countersp counters)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is an example of <span class="v">show-counters</span> being called:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(3 0 NIL)</pre> 
 
 <p>This is what we would see had we set the <span class="v">NodeCnt</span> field of the initial 
 value of <span class="v">counters</span> to <span class="v">3</span>, as we did earlier in this example.</p> 
 
 <p>We next wish to define a function to reset the <span class="v">counters</span> object.  We 
 could define it this way:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> reset-counters (counters)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (counters)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((counters (update-NodeCnt 0 counters)))
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((counters (update-TipCnt 0 counters)))
      (update-IntTipsSeen nil counters))))</pre> 
 
 <p>which ``successively'' sets the <span class="v">NodeCnt</span> field to <span class="v">0</span>, then the 
 <span class="v">TipCnt</span> field to <span class="v">0</span>, and then the <span class="v">IntTipsSeen</span> field to <span class="v">nil</span> 
 and returns the resulting object.</p> 
 
 <p>However, the nest of <span class="v">let</span> expressions is tedious and we use this 
 definition instead.  This definition exploits a macro, here named ``<span class="v">seq</span>'' 
 (for ``sequentially'') which evaluates each of the forms given, binding their 
 results successively to the stobj name given.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> reset-counters (counters)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (counters)))
  (<a href="ACL2____SEQ.html">seq</a> counters
       (update-NodeCnt 0 counters)
       (update-TipCnt 0 counters)
       (update-IntTipsSeen nil counters)))</pre> 
 
 <p>This definition is syntactically identical to the one above, after macro 
 expansion.  Our definition of <span class="v">seq</span> is shown below and is not part of 
 native ACL2.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> seq (<a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> &amp;rest rst)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> rst) stobj)
        ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> rst)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> rst))
        (t `(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((,stobj ,(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> rst)))
             (<a href="ACL2____SEQ.html">seq</a> ,stobj ,@(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> rst))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The signature printed for <span class="v">reset-counters</span> is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(RESET-COUNTERS COUNTERS) =&gt; COUNTERS.</pre> 
 
 <p>Here is an example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(3 0 NIL)
ACL2 !&gt;(reset-counters counters)
&lt;counters&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(0 0 NIL)</pre> 
 
 <p>Here finally is a function that uses <span class="v">counters</span> as a single-threaded 
 accumulator to collect the desired information about the tree <span class="v">x</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sweep-tree (x counters)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs (counters)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> x)
         (<a href="ACL2____SEQ.html">seq</a> counters
              (update-TipCnt (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 (TipCnt counters)) counters)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> x)
                  (update-IntTipsSeen (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x (IntTipsSeen counters))
                                  counters)
                counters)))
        (t (<a href="ACL2____SEQ.html">seq</a> counters
                (update-NodeCnt (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 (NodeCnt counters)) counters)
                (sweep-tree (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) counters)
                (sweep-tree (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x) counters)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>We can paraphrase this definition as follows.  If <span class="v">x</span> is an atom, then 
 increment the <span class="v">TipCnt</span> field of <span class="v">counters</span> and <i>then</i>, if <span class="v">x</span> is 
 an integer, add <span class="v">x</span> to the <span class="v">IntTipsSeen</span> field, and return 
 <span class="v">counters</span>.  On the other hand, if <span class="v">x</span> is not an atom, then increment 
 the <span class="v">NodeCnt</span> field of <span class="v">counters</span>, and <i>then</i> sweep the <span class="v">car</span> of 
 <span class="v">x</span> and <i>then</i> sweep the <span class="v">cdr</span> of <span class="v">x</span> and return the result.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is an example of its execution.  We have displayed the input tree in 
 full dot notation so that the number of interior nodes is just the number of 
 dots.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(sweep-tree '((((a . 1) . (2 . b)) . 3)
                     . (4 . (5 . d)))
                   counters)
&lt;counters&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(7 8 (5 4 3 2 1))
ACL2 !&gt;(reset-counters counters)
&lt;counters&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;(show-counters counters)
(0 0 NIL)</pre> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">counters</span> object has two integer fields and a field whose type is 
 unrestricted.  single-threaded objects support other types of fields, such as 
 arrays.  We deal with that in the <a href="ACL2____STOBJ-EXAMPLE-2.html">stobj-example-2</a>.  But we recommend 
 that you first consider the implementation issues for the <span class="v">counters</span> 
 example (in <a href="ACL2____STOBJ-EXAMPLE-1-IMPLEMENTATION.html">stobj-example-1-implementation</a>) and then consider the proof 
 issues (in <a href="ACL2____STOBJ-EXAMPLE-1-PROOFS.html">stobj-example-1-proofs</a>).</p>
