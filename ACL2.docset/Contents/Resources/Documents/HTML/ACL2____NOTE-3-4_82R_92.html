<p>ACL2 Version  3.4(r) (August, 2008) Notes</p><p>Please also see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-3-4.html">note-3-4</a> for changes to Version 3.4 of 
  ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed makefiles, <span class="v">books/nonstd/Makefile</span> and <span class="v">GNUmakefile</span>.  The old 
 set-up seemed to work fine as long as all books certified, but it was really 
 broken, for example only certifying some of the books in 
 <span class="v">books/nonstd/nsa/</span>, and then only when required by books in other 
 directories.  Also fixed the ``<span class="v">clean</span>'' target to clean links rather than 
 to make links.</p>
