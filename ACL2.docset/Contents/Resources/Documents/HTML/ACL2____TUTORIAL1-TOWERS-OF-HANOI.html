<p>The Towers of Hanoi Example</p><p>This example was written almost entirely by Bill Young of 
 Computational Logic, Inc.</p> 
 
 <p>We will formalize and prove a small theorem about the famous ``Towers of 
 Hanoi'' problem.  This problem is illustrated by the following picture.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">   |        |        |
   |        |        |
  ---       |        |
 -----      |        |
-------     |        |

   A        B        C</pre> 
 
 <p>We have three pegs — <span class="v">a</span>, <span class="v">b</span>, and <span class="v">c</span> — and <span class="v">n</span> 
 disks of different sizes.  The disks are all initially on peg <span class="v">a</span>.  The 
 goal is to move all disks to peg <span class="v">c</span> while observing the following two 
 rules.</p> 
 
 <p>1. Only one disk may be moved at a time, and it must start and finish the 
 move as the topmost disk on some peg;</p> 
 
 <p>2. A disk can never be placed on top of a smaller disk.</p> 
 
 <p>Let's consider some simple instances of this problem.  If <span class="v">n</span> = 1, i.e., 
 only one disk is to be moved, simply move it from <span class="v">a</span> to <span class="v">c</span>.  If <span class="v">n</span> 
 = 2, i.e., two disks are to be moved, the following sequence of moves 
 suffices: move from <span class="v">a</span> to <span class="v">b</span>, move from <span class="v">a</span> to <span class="v">c</span>, move from 
 <span class="v">b</span> to <span class="v">c</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>In this doc topic we will show an ACL2 function that generates a suitable 
 list of moves for a tower of <span class="v">n</span> disks.  Then we will use ACL2 to prove 
 that the number of moves is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n) 1)</span>.  For an ACL2 script that 
 proves the correctness of (a version of) this function, see the community book 
 <span class="v">"misc/hanoi.lisp"</span> in the <span class="v">books</span> directory of your ACL2 sources.</p> 
 
 <p>In general, this problem has a straightforward recursive solution.  Suppose 
 that we desire to move <span class="v">n</span> disks from <span class="v">a</span> to <span class="v">c</span>, using <span class="v">b</span> as the 
 intermediate peg.  For the basis, we saw above that we can always move a 
 single disk from <span class="v">a</span> to <span class="v">c</span>.  Now if we have <span class="v">n</span> disks and assume 
 that we can solve the problem for <span class="v">n-1</span> disks, we can move <span class="v">n</span> disks as 
 follows.  First, move <span class="v">n-1</span> disks from <span class="v">a</span> to <span class="v">b</span> using <span class="v">c</span> as the 
 intermediate peg; move the single disk from <span class="v">a</span> to <span class="v">c</span>; then move 
 <span class="v">n-1</span> disks from <span class="v">b</span> to <span class="v">c</span> using <span class="v">a</span> as the intermediate peg.</p> 
 
 <p>In ACL2, we can write a function that will return the sequence of moves. 
 One such function is as follows.  Notice that we have two base cases.  If 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> n)</span> then <span class="v">n</span> is not a positive integer; we treat that case as if 
 <span class="v">n</span> were 0 and return an empty list of moves.  If <span class="v">n</span> is 1, then we 
 return a list containing the single appropriate move.  Otherwise, we return 
 the list containing exactly the moves dictated by our recursive analysis 
 above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> move (a b)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'move a 'to b))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> hanoi (a b c n)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> n)
      nil
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> n 1)
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (move a c))
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (hanoi a c b (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> n))
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (move a c)
                    (hanoi b a c (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> n)))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Notice that we give <span class="v">hanoi</span> four arguments: the three pegs, and the 
 number of disks to move.  It is necessary to supply the pegs because, in 
 recursive calls, the roles of the pegs differ.  In any execution of the 
 algorithm, a given peg will sometimes be the source of a move, sometimes the 
 destination, and sometimes the intermediate peg.</p> 
 
 <p>After submitting these functions to ACL2, we can execute the <span class="v">hanoi</span> 
 function on various specific arguments.  For example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(hanoi 'a 'b 'c 1)
((MOVE A TO C))

ACL2 !&gt;(hanoi 'a 'b 'c 2)
((MOVE A TO B)
 (MOVE A TO C)
 (MOVE B TO C))

ACL2 !&gt;(hanoi 'a 'b 'c 3)
((MOVE A TO C)
 (MOVE A TO B)
 (MOVE C TO B)
 (MOVE A TO C)
 (MOVE B TO A)
 (MOVE B TO C)
 (MOVE A TO C))</pre> 
 
 <p>From the algorithm it is clear that if it takes <span class="v">m</span> moves to transfer 
 <span class="v">n</span> disks, it will take <span class="v">(m + 1 + m) = 2m + 1</span> moves for <span class="v">n+1</span> disks. 
 From some simple calculations, we see that we need the following number of 
 moves in specific cases:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Disks   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7  ...
Moves   0   1   3   7  15  31  63  127 ...</pre> 
 
 <p>The pattern is fairly clear.  To move <span class="v">n</span> disks requires <span class="v">(2^n - 1)</span> 
 moves.  Let's attempt to use ACL2 to prove that fact.</p> 
 
 <p>First of all, how do we state our conjecture?  Recall that <span class="v">hanoi</span> 
 returns a list of moves.  The length of the list (given by the function 
 <span class="v">len</span>) is the number of moves required.  Thus, we can state the following 
 conjecture.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> hanoi-moves-required-first-try
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> (hanoi a b c n))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n))))</pre> 
 
 <p>When we submit this to ACL2, the proof attempt fails.  Along the way we 
 notice subgoals such as:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Subgoal *1/1'
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> 0 N))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> 0 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">EXPT</a> 2 N)))).</pre> 
 
 <p>This tells us that the prover is considering cases that are uninteresting 
 to us, namely, cases in which <span class="v">n</span> might be negative.  The only cases that 
 are really of interest are those in which <span class="v">n</span> is a non-negative natural 
 number.  Therefore, we revise our theorem as follows:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> hanoi-moves-required
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> n)
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> 0 n))    ;; n is at least 0
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> (hanoi a b c n))
                  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>and submit it to ACL2 again.</p> 
 
 <p>Again the proof fails.  Examining the proof script we encounter the 
 following text.  (How did we decide to focus on this goal?  Some information 
 is provided in ACLH, and the ACL2 documentation on <a href="ACL2____TIPS.html">tips</a> may be helpful. 
 But the simplest answer is: this was the first goal suggested by the ``<a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>'' tool below the start of the proof by induction.  See <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.)</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Subgoal *1/5''
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">INTEGERP</a> N)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> 0 N)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> N 1))
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">LEN</a> (HANOI A C B (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 N)))
                     (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">EXPT</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 N))))
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">LEN</a> (HANOI B A C (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 N)))
                     (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">EXPT</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 N)))))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">LEN</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> (HANOI A C B (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 N))
                             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">LIST</a> 'MOVE A 'TO C)
                                   (HANOI B A C (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 N)))))
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">EXPT</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 N))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>It is difficult to make much sense of such a complicated goal.  However, we 
 do notice something interesting.  In the conclusion is a <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> of the 
 following shape.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">LEN</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">APPEND</a> ... ...))</pre> 
 
 <p>We conjecture that the length of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a></span> of two lists should be 
 the sum of the lengths of the lists.  If the prover knew that, it could 
 possibly have simplified this <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> earlier and made more progress in 
 the proof.  Therefore, we need a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule that will suggest such a 
 simplification to the prover.  The appropriate rule is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> len-append
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> x) (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> y))))</pre> 
 
 <p>We submit this to the prover, which proves it by a straightforward 
 induction.  The prover stores this lemma as a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule and will 
 subsequently (unless we <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> the rule) replace <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>s matching 
 the left hand side of the rule with the appropriate instance of the <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> on the right hand side.</p> 
 
 <p>We now resubmit our lemma <span class="v">hanoi-moves-required</span> to ACL2.  On this 
 attempt, the proof succeeds and we are done.</p> 
 
 <p>One bit of cleaning up is useful.  We needed the hypotheses that:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> n) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> 0 n)).</pre> 
 
 <p>This is an awkward way of saying that <span class="v">n</span> is a natural number; natural 
 is not a primitive data type in ACL2.  We could define a function 
 <span class="v">naturalp</span>, but it is somewhat more convenient to define a macro as 
 follows:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> naturalp (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'and (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'integerp x)
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> '&lt;= 0 x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Subsequently, we can use <span class="v">(naturalp n)</span> wherever we need to note that a 
 quantity is a natural number.  See <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> for more information about 
 ACL2 macros.  With this macro, we can reformulate our theorem as follows:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> hanoi-moves-required
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (naturalp n)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> (hanoi a b c n))
                  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n))))).</pre> 
 
 <p>Another interesting (but much harder) theorem asserts that the list of 
 moves generated by our <span class="v">hanoi</span> function actually accomplishes the desired 
 goal while following the rules.  When you can state and prove that theorem, 
 you'll be a very competent ACL2 user.</p> 
 
 <p>By the way, the name ``Towers of Hanoi'' derives from a legend that a group 
 of Vietnamese monks works day and night to move a stack of 64 gold disks from 
 one diamond peg to another, following the rules set out above.  We're told 
 that the world will end when they complete this task.  From the theorem above, 
 we know that this requires 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 moves:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 64))
18446744073709551615
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>We're guessing they won't finish any time soon.</p>
