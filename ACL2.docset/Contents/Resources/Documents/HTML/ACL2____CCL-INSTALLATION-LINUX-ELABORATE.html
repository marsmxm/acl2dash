<p>Installing Clozure Common Lisp (CCL) on Linux (elaborate version)</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____CCL-INSTALLATION.html">ccl-installation</a> for introductory remarks.  The 
 ``cookbook'' instructions below give you one way to install CCL on Linux 
 without any knowledge of git or CCL.  For more streamlined instructions see 
 <a href="ACL2____CCL-INSTALLATION-LINUX-BRIEF.html">ccl-installation-linux-brief</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Note</b>: Linux users may need to install m4.</p> 
 
 <p>First fetch CCL from GitHub as follows.  (You may prefer to use ``<span class="v">git
 pull</span>'' if you previously did this step.  In that case you probably won't 
 want to do the optional renaming of the directory, mentioned below.)</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"># Obtain a ccl distribution in a fresh directory:
mkdir temp
cd temp
git clone https://github.com/Clozure/ccl
# Optionally rename that directory as suggested below, after
# executing the following three commands.
cd ccl
git rev-parse HEAD
cd ../../
# Optionally change directory name, and then go back to ccl directory:
# You'll want the last 10 hex digits to match those of the
# output from the ``git rev-parse HEAD'' command above: do
# that twice here and once further below.
mv temp 2017-12-07-6be8298fe5
cd 2017-12-07-6be8298fe5/ccl</pre> 
 
 <p>Next fetch and extract a development snapshot.  The version below is 
 current as of this writing (December, 2021), but see <a href="https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/" target="_blank"><nobr>https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/"></nobr></a> 
 for the latest snapshots.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">wget https://github.com/Clozure/ccl/releases/download/v1.12.1/linuxx86.tar.gz
tar xfz linuxx86.tar.gz</pre> 
 
 <p>Rebuild and quit, twice.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">echo '(rebuild-ccl :full t)' | ./lx86cl64
echo '(rebuild-ccl :full t)' | ./lx86cl64</pre> 
 
 <p>Create an executable script like the following.  You might want to call it 
 ``<span class="v">ccl</span>'' and put it into a directory on your path.  Be sure to change the 
 name (shown as ``2017-12-07-6be8298fe5'' above) to match the name change 
 already made above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">#!/bin/sh

export CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY=/projects/acl2/lisps/ccl/2017-12-07-6be8298fe5/ccl
${CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY}/scripts/ccl64 "$@"</pre> 
 
 <p>Now ensure that your script is executable, e.g.:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">chmod +x my-script</pre> 
 
 <p>You're done!  (Note however that certification of <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> that use 
 <a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">Quicklisp</a> may require <span class="v">openssl</span> to be installed if it is not already 
 on your system.)</p>
