<p>Core operations on <a href="SV____4VEC.html">4vec</a>s.</p><p>We now introduce many operations on <a href="SV____4VEC.html">4vec</a>s.  These operations 
are generally intended to support the modeling of Verilog and SystemVerilog 
expressions.  For instance, our <a href="SV____4VEC-PLUS.html">4vec-plus</a> operation agrees with the 
Verilog notion of plus: if there are any X or Z bits in either input, it 
``conservatively'' returns all Xes.  Most of these operations have 
corresponding <a href="SV____SVEX.html">svex</a> <a href="SV____FUNCTIONS.html">functions</a> and can hence be used in <a href="SV____EXPRESSIONS.html">expressions</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Many of these operations have similarities with the <a href="ACL2____4V-OPERATIONS.html">ACL2::4v-operations</a> which were used in <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>.  But SV expressions 
are vectors instead of single bits, so there are many 4vec operations with no 
4v equivalents (e.g., plus, times, etc.).  Historically these operations were 
bit-blasted using the <a href="VL2014____OCCFORM.html">vl2014::occform</a> transformation, but in svex they 
are primitives with well-defined semantics.</p> 
 
<p><u>Boolean Convention</u>.  Most 4vec operations take and return <a href="SV____4VEC.html">4vec</a> 
objectsâ€”even comparisons, reductions, etc., which you might instead 
expect to produce a Boolean result.  In these cases, we typically arrange so 
that ``true'' is indicated by the all-1s vector (i.e., -1), ``false'' is 
indicated by the all-0s vector (i.e., 0), and undetermined values are indicated 
by the all-Xes vector.  This is sometimes convenient in that it avoids needing 
to explicitly replicate/extend comparison results.</p> 
 
<p>It is critical that these functions support efficient symbolic simulation 
with <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a>.  However, the logical definitions of these functions are 
typically not relevant to this, because we use a custom translation from <a href="SV____EXPRESSIONS.html">expressions</a> into <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">ACL2::aig</a>s; see <a href="SV____BIT-BLASTING.html">bit-blasting</a> for details.</p>
