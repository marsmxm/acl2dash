<p>Representation of a single port.</p><p>This is a ``transparent'' sum type introduced using <a href="FTY____DEFTRANSSUM.html">deftranssum</a>.  It 
              is simply any one of the following types:</p><ul> 
<li><a href="VL____VL-REGULARPORT.html">vl-regularport</a></li> 
<li><a href="VL____VL-INTERFACEPORT.html">vl-interfaceport</a></li> 
</ul> 
<p>Most ports are regular ports, see <a href="VL____VL-REGULARPORT.html">vl-regularport</a>.  However, 
SystemVerilog also adds interface ports, see <a href="VL____VL-INTERFACEPORT.html">vl-interfaceport</a>.</p> 
 
<p>It is generally best to <b>avoid using port names</b> except perhaps for 
things like error messages.  Why?  As shown above, some ports might not have 
names, and even when a port does have a name, it does not necessarily 
correspond to any wires in the module.  Since these cases are exotic, code that 
is based on port names is likely to work for simple test cases, but then fail 
later when more complex examples are encountered!</p> 
 
<p>Usually you should not need to deal with port names.  The <a href="VL____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> 
transform converts module instances that use named arguments into their plain 
equivalents, and once this has been done there really isn't much reason to have 
port names anymore.  Instead, you can work directly with the port's 
expression.</p> 
 
<p>Our <span class="v">vl-port-p</span> structures do not restrict the kinds of expressions that 
may be used as the internal wiring, but we generally expect that each such 
expression should satisfy <a href="VL____VL-PORTEXPR-P.html">vl-portexpr-p</a>.</p> 
 
<p>A "blank" port expression (represented by <span class="v">nil</span>) means the port is not 
connected to any wires within the module.  Our <a href="VL____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> transform will 
issue non-fatal <a href="VL____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> if any non-blank arguments are connected to 
blank ports, or if blank arguments are connected to non-blank ports.  It is 
usually not hard to support blank ports in other transformations.</p> 
 
<p>The direction of a port can most safely be obtained by <a href="VL____VL-PORT-DIRECTION.html">vl-port-direction</a>.  Note that directions are not particularly reliable in 
Verilog: one can assign to a input or read from an output, and in simulators 
like Cadence this can actually impact values on wires in the supermodule as if 
the ports have no buffers.  We call this "backflow." <b>BOZO</b> eventually 
implement a comprehensive approach to detecting and dealing with backflow.</p> 
 
<p>The width of a port can be determined after expression sizing has been 
performed by examining the width of the port expression.</p>
