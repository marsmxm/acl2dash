<p>Define a GL clause processor with a given set of built-in symbolic 
  counterparts.</p><p>Usage:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">def-gl-clause-processor</a> my-gl-clause-processor
  :output with-output-settings)</pre> 
 
<p>The above form defines a GL clause processor function named 
my-gl-clause-processor.  This clause processor is defined so that it can 
execute all existing symbolic counterpart functions.</p> 
 
<p>If one adds symbolic counterpart functions, either by hand-coding them, 
using make-g-world, or including books that add them, one will need to define a 
new GL clause processor.</p> 
 
<p>Each GL clause processor has an associated sets of functions that it can 
directly execute symbolically.  DEF-GL-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR makes a new processor 
that can execute the full set of existing symbolic counterparts. (Symbolic 
counterparts may be defined by hand or using make-g-world.)</p> 
 
<p>It used to be the case that the clause processor also had a fixed set of 
functions it could execute concretely.  That is no longer the case.  We still 
accept the old form of def-gl-clause-processor, which takes an additional 
argument after the name of the clause processor and before the :output keyword 
 (if any).  However, this is deprecated and a message will be printed saying so.

clause processor to prove theorems.</p>
