(commands 10 t)

General Forms:

commands or (commands nil)
Print out all the instructions (in the current state-stack) in
reverse order, i.e. from the most recent instruction to the starting
instruction.

(commands n) [n a positive integer]
Print out the most recent n instructions (in the current
state-stack), in reverse order.

(commands x abbreviate-flag)
Same as above, but if abbreviate-flag is non-NIL, then do not
display commands between ``matching bookends''.  See documentation
for comm for an explanation of matching bookends.</pre> 
 
 <p><b>Remark</b>: If there are more than <span class="v">n</span> instructions in the 
 state-stack, then <span class="v">(commands n)</span> is the same as <span class="v">commands</span> (and also, 
 <span class="v">(commands n abb)</span> is the same as <span class="v">(commands nil abb)</span>).</p>
