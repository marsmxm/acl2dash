<p>Recommended best practices for ACL2 books.</p><h2>DRAFT</h2> 
 
<p>This is a preliminary document.  Feedback is very much welcome and 
appreciated.  Please direct feedback to the acl2-books list or to Jared 
Davis.</p> 
 
<p>We recommend the use of the Standard Libraries (<a href="ACL2____STD.html">std</a>) to ease your 
burden of modeling and reasoning in a formal sytem.  See other subtopics below 
for other best practices.</p> 
 
<p>If you expect your library to be used at all by other people, put your code 
in a package.  Jared, Rager, and Kaufmann spend a large amount of time just 
dealing with name clashes, and it leaves them grumpy.  See <a href="ACL2____WORKING-WITH-PACKAGES.html">working-with-packages</a>.</p>
