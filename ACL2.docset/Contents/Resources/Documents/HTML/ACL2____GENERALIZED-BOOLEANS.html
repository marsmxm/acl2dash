<p>Potential soundness issues related to ACL2 predicates</p><p>The discussion below outlines a potential source of unsoundness in 
 ACL2.  Although to our knowledge there is no existing Lisp implementation in 
 which this problem can arise, nevertheless we feel compelled to explain this 
 situation.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider for example the question: What is the value of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> 3 3)</span>? 
 According to the ACL2 axioms, it's <span class="v">t</span>.  And as far as we know, based on 
 considerable testing, the value is <span class="v">t</span> in every Common Lisp implementation. 
 However, according the Common Lisp draft proposed ANSI standard, any 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> value could result.  Thus for example, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> 3 3)</span> is 
 allowed by the standard to be <span class="v">17</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The Common Lisp standard specifies (or soon will) that a number of Common 
 Lisp functions that one might expect to return Boolean values may, in fact, 
 return arbitrary values.  Examples of such functions are <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a></span>; a much more complete list is given below.  Indeed, 
 we dare to say that every Common Lisp function that one may believe returns 
 only Booleans is, nevertheless, not specified by the standard to have that 
 property, with the exceptions of the functions <span class="v">not</span> and <span class="v">null</span>.  The 
 standard refers to such arbitrary values as ``generalized Booleans,'' but in 
 fact this terminology makes no restriction on those values.  Rather, it merely 
 specifies that they are to be viewed, in an informal sense, as being either 
 <span class="v">nil</span> or not <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>This situation is problematic for ACL2, which axiomatizes these functions 
 to return Booleans.  The problem is that because (for efficiency and 
 simplicity) ACL2 makes very direct use of compiled Common Lisp functions to 
 support the execution of its functions, there is in principle a potential for 
 unsoundness due to these ``generalized Booleans.''  For example, ACL2's <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> function is defined to be Common Lisp's <span class="v">equal</span>.  Hence if in Common 
 Lisp the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> 3 3)</span> were to evaluate to 17, then in ACL2 we could 
 prove (using the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span> of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>) 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> 3 3) 17)</span>.  However, ACL2 can also prove <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> x
 x) t)</span>, and these two terms together are contradictory, since they imply 
 (instantiating <span class="v">x</span> in the second term by <span class="v">3</span>) that <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> 3 3)</span> is 
 both equal to <span class="v">17</span> and to <span class="v">t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>To make matters worse, the standard allows <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> 3 3)</span> to evaluate to 
 <i>different</i> non-<span class="v">nil</span> values every time.  That is: <span class="v">equal</span> need not 
 even be a function!</p> 
 
 <p>Fortunately, no existing Lisp implementation takes advantage of the 
 flexibility to have (most of) its predicates return generalized Booleans, as 
 far as we know.  We may implement appropriate safeguards in future releases of 
 ACL2, in analogy to (indeed, probably extending) the existing safeguards by 
 way of guards (see <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>).  For now, we'll sleep a bit better knowing 
 that we have been up-front about this potential problem.</p> 
 
 <p>The following list of functions contains all those that are defined in 
 Common Lisp to return generalized Booleans but are assumed by ACL2 to return 
 Booleans.  In addition, the functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-NUMBERP.html">ACL2-numberp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPLEX-RATIONALP.html">complex-rationalp</a></span> are directly defined in terms of respective Common Lisp 
 functions <span class="v">numberp</span> and <span class="v">complexp</span>.</p>
