     For additional details, 
     you may also see the raw <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master" target="_blank"><nobr>commit log<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master"></nobr></a>.</p><h3>New Libraries</h3><h4>Alists-light library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">alists-light</span> has been added.  It aims to 
   provide basic reasoning about alists while being as lightweight as possible. 
   See the directory <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/alists-light</span>.</p><h4>Arithmetic-light library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">arithmetic-light</span> has been added.  It aims to 
   provide basic arithmetic reasoning while being as lightweight as possible.  See 
   the directory <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/arithmetic-light</span>.</p><h4>Axe</h4><p>A directory has been started to contain the implementation of 
   Kestrel's Axe tool.  This will be populated over time as we open source Axe. 
   See the directory <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/axe</span>.</p><h4>Booleans library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">booleans</span> has been added.  It provides 
   definitions and rules about operations on booleans.  See the directory 
   <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/booleans</span>.</p><h4>BV (bit vector) library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">bv</span>, has been added.  It contains a 
   formalization of bit vectors as natural numbers.  The library underlies 
   several tools developed by Kestrel researchers. See the directory 
   <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/bv</span>.</p><h4>BV-Lists library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">bv-lists</span>, has been added. It formalizes 
   notions related to lists of bit vectors from the <span class="v">bv</span> library, including 
   packing, unpacking, and conversions between lists of bits and lists of 
   bytes. See the directory <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/bv-lists</span>.</p><h4>Centaur meta-reasoning library</h4><p>The <span class="v">centaur/meta</span> directory contains various new books focused 
     on meta-reasoning, differing from previous efforts in their use of 
     <span class="v">clause-processors/pseudo-term-fty.lisp</span> to treat pseudo-terms as a 
     sum-of-products type.  Among other things, this directory contains an 
     unconditional rewriter, a let-abstraction clause processor, and a clause 
     processor that quickly removes irrelevant parts of a clause during mutual 
     inductions using <span class="v">tools/flag.lisp</span>.</p><h4><a href="HDWALLET____CRYPTO-HDWALLET.html">Cryptocurrency Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet</a></h4><p>This is a simple proof of concept of 
     a hierarchical deterministic wallet for cryptocurrencies, 
     which makes use of the <a href="CRYPTO____CRYPTOGRAPHY.html">cryptographic</a>, <a href="BITCOIN____BITCOIN.html">Bitcoin</a>, and <a href="ETHEREUM____ETHEREUM.html">Ethereum</a> libraries.</p><h4>File-io-light library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">file-io-light</span> has been added.  It aims to 
   provide rules about basic input/output operations on files, while being as 
   lightweight as possible.  See the directory 
   <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/file-io-light</span>.</p><h4>Library-wrappers library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">library-wrappers</span>, has been added. It contains 
   books that aim to improve other libraries by including them and then 
   disabling or replacing rules that may be problematic. See the directory 
   <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/library-wrappers</span>.</p><h4>Lists-light library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">lists-light</span> has been added.  It aims to 
   provide basic reasoning about lists while being as lightweight as possible.  See 
   the directory <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/lists-light</span>.</p><h4>Prime-fields library</h4><p>A new library, <span class="v">prime-fields</span> has been added.  It contains a 
   formalization of prime fields and associated operations.  A prime field is a 
   finite field consisting of the integers modulo some prime. See the directory 
   <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/prime-fields</span>.</p><h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2SYSTEM.html">Standard System Library</a></h4><p>A new library for standard system utilities has been started. 
     This is currently mostly under the Kestrel books, 
     but it will be gradually moved directly under <span class="v">[books]/std/system</span>. 
     This new library is being populated 
     with existing utilities factored out of 
     some Kestrel Books with system utilities, 
     as well as with some new utilities.</p><h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2TESTING.html">Standard Testing Library</a></h4><p>A new library for standard testing utilities has been started.  The 
     contents of the files <span class="v">[books]/misc/assert.lisp</span> and 
     <span class="v">[books]/misc/eval.lisp</span> have been moved here (with the same names), 
     while the two files under <span class="v">[books]/misc/</span> have been turned into 
     relocation stubs.  The utilities in those two files have been moved to new 
     individual files for greater modularity.  Some new testing utilities have 
     been added to this new library as well.</p><h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2TYPED-ALISTS.html">Standard Typed Alists Library</a></h4><p>A new library has been added, 
     to collect recognizers and theorems for typed alists, 
     i.e. alists whose keys and values have specified types. 
     This is analogous to <a href="ACL2____STD_F2TYPED-LISTS.html">Std/typed-lists</a>.</p><h3>Changes to Existing Libraries</h3><h4><a href="ABNF____ABNF.html">ABNF Library</a></h4><p>Some functions have been improved slightly.</p><p>Some theorems have been added.</p><h4><a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">Aignet Library</a></h4><p>Added <span class="v">centaur/aignet/cube-sat.lisp</span>, containing utilities for checking 
     satisfiability using <a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a> of a cube of aignet literals, possibly 
     after applying combinational-equivalence-preserving transformations.</p><h4>
<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">Apply$</a> Books</h4><p>The proof of lemma <span class="v">apply$-prim-meta-fn-correct</span> is much faster in the 
    <span class="v">"apply-prim"</span> books in directories <span class="v">"system/apply/"</span>, 
    <span class="v">"projects/apply-model/"</span>, and <span class="v">"projects/apply-model-2/"</span>.  In 
    particular, the time for proving that lemma in 
    <span class="v">"projects/apply-model-2/apply-prim.lisp"</span> has been measured (on a 
    Mac) at just under 3 minutes after the change but at 27.7 minutes before 
    the change.</p><h4><a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a></h4><p>A new transformation, <span class="tt"><a href="APT____CASESPLIT.html">apt::casesplit</a></span>, 
     has been added to rephrase a function by cases.</p><p>A new transformation, <span class="tt"><a href="APT____ISODATA.html">apt::isodata</a></span>, 
     has been added to transform data between isomorphic representations.</p><p><span class="tt"><a href="APT____PARTEVAL.html">apt::parteval</a></span> now provides better support 
     for recursive functions whose static arguments 
     do not change across recursive calls. 
     <span class="tt"><a href="APT____PARTEVAL.html">apt::parteval</a></span> has also been extended to support <a href="APT____UNTRANSLATE-SPECIFIER.html">untranslate specifiers</a>.</p><p><span class="tt"><a href="APT____RESTRICT.html">apt::restrict</a></span> now supports reflexive functions, 
     i.e. functions that occur in their termination theorem.</p><p>An input has been added to <span class="tt"><a href="APT____TAILREC.html">apt::tailrec</a></span> to control whether 
     the wrapper function is generated or not.</p><p>A table of APT defaults has been started. 
     See <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/apt/utilities/defaults-table.lisp</span>.</p><p>New APT-specific XDOC constructors have been added. 
     Some APT-specific XDOC constructors have been extended and improved.</p><h4>Arithmetic-3</h4><p>The inclusion of <span class="v">arithmetic-3/floor-mod/mod-expt-fast</span> in 
   <span class="v">arithmetic-3/top</span> has been commented out to prevent clashes with 
   <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span>.</p><h4>Arithmetic-5</h4><p>The inclusion of <span class="v">arithmetic-5/lib/floor-mod/mod-expt-fast</span> in 
   <span class="v">arithmetic-5/lib/floor-mod/top</span>, which is in turn included by 
   <span class="v">arithmetic-5/top</span>, has been commented out to prevent clashes with 
   <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span>.</p><h4><a href="BITCOIN____BITCOIN.html">Bitcoin Library</a></h4><p>Some theorems have been added.</p><p>Verified executable attachments have been added 
     for some of the non-executable functions in the BIP 32 formalization.</p><h4><a href="CRYPTO____CRYPTOGRAPHY.html">Cryptographic Library</a></h4><p>A <a href="ECURVE____ELLIPTIC-CURVES.html">sub-library for elliptic curves</a> has been added, 
     which currently contains all the secp256k1 domain parameters, 
     and fixtypes for secp256k1 field elements, points, and keys. 
     The parameters and the fixtypes that were previously part of the <a href="ECURVE____SECP256K1-INTERFACE.html">elliptic curve secp256k1 interface</a> have been removed from that interface, 
     which now includes the domain parameters and the fixtypes 
     from the new sub-library.</p><p>A <a href="ECDSA____ELLIPTIC-CURVE-DIGITAL-SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM.html">sub-library for ECDSA</a> (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) 
     has been added, which now contains the secp256k1 signing interface, 
     which was previously part of the <a href="ECURVE____SECP256K1-INTERFACE.html">elliptic curve secp256k1 interface</a>.</p><p>A sub-library has been added that includes formal specifications for the 
    SHA-2 hash functions: SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512.  The new 
    sub-library is in <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/crypto/sha-2/</span>.</p><p>A <a href="KECCAK____KECCAK.html">sub-library for KECCAK / SHA-3 hash functions</a> has been added.</p><p>A sub-library has been added that includes formal specifications for 
    HMAC-SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA-512, i.e., for the HMAC keyed-hash message 
    authentication code, using either SHA-256 or SHA-512 as the underlying hash 
    function.  The new sub-library is in <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/crypto/hmac/</span>.</p><p>A sub-library for Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) 
     as specified by RFC 8018, and specialized to use HMAC SHA-512, 
     has been added. 
     See <span class="tt"><a href="KDF____PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-512.html">kdf::pbkdf2-hmac-sha-512</a></span>.</p><p>A sub-library has been added that includes formal specifications for 
    several common padding operations used in cryptography.  The new 
    sub-library is in <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/crypto/padding/</span>.</p><p>A macro <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-HASH.html">crypto::definterface-hash</a></span> has been added 
     to introduce interfaces of hash functions.</p><p>A macro <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-HMAC.html">crypto::definterface-hmac</a></span> has been added 
     to introduce interfaces of HMAC functions.</p><p>A macro <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-PBKDF2.html">crypto::definterface-pbkdf2</a></span> has been added 
     to introduce interfaces of PBKDF2 functions.</p><p>A macro <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-ENCRYPT-BLOCK.html">crypto::definterface-encrypt-block</a></span> has been added 
     to introduce interfaces of block encryption/decryption functions.</p><p>A macro <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-ENCRYPT-INIT.html">crypto::definterface-encrypt-init</a></span> has been added 
     to introduce interfaces of encryption/decryption functions 
     that use initialization vectors 
     (as in certain block cipher modes of operation).</p><p>Interfaces have been introduced (via <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-HASH.html">crypto::definterface-hash</a></span>) 
     for the hash functions 
     Keccak-256, Keccak-512, RIPEMD-160, SHA-256, and SHA-512. 
     These supersede the previously existing placeholders 
     for Keccak-256, RIPEMD-160, and SHA-256, which have been removed.</p><p>Interfaces have been introduced (via <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-HMAC.html">crypto::definterface-hmac</a></span>) 
     for the HMAC functions HMAC-SHA-256 and HMAC-SHA-512. 
     These supersede the previously existing placeholder 
     for HMAC-SHA-512, which has been removed.</p><p>Interfaces have been introduced (via <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-PBKDF2.html">crypto::definterface-pbkdf2</a></span>) 
     for the PBKDF2 functions HMAC-SHA-256 and PBKDF2 HMAC-SHA-512. 
     These supersede the previously existing placeholder 
     for PBKDF2 HMAC-SHA-512, which has been removed.</p><p>Interfaces have been introduced 
     (via <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-ENCRYPT-BLOCK.html">crypto::definterface-encrypt-block</a></span>) 
     for the AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 block ciphers.</p><p>Interfaces have been introduced

     for the AES-128 CBC PKCS7, AES-192 CBC PKCS7, and AES-256 CBC PKCS7 
     ciphers (CBC mode, PKCS7 padding).</p><p>The `placeholder' for elliptic curve secp256k1 
     has been turned into an `interface' for elliptic curve secp256k1, 
     consistently with the changes above. 
     There are no more cryptographic `placeholders', 
     but `interfaces' instead. 
     Their structure is quite similar, 
     but the nomenclature indicates a more permanent status.</p><p>The <a href="ECURVE____SECP256K1-INTERFACE.html">elliptic curve secp256k1 interface</a> has been extended with an (abstract) signing operation.</p><p>Executable attachments have been added for

     to generate additional theorems. 
     It has also been extended with an option <span class="v">:elementp-of-nil</span>, 
     similar to <span class="tt"><a href="STD____DEFLIST.html">std::deflist</a></span>, 
     which results in some better theorems when supplied.</p><p>A new macro <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFIXEQUIV-SK.html">fty::deffixequiv-sk</a></span> has been added 
     to automate the proof of <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFIXEQUIV.html">fty::deffixequiv</a></span> theorems

     to introduce ``flat'' (i.e. not tagged) sums of disjoint types.</p><h4><a href="ACL2____GL.html">GL</a></h4><p>Changed accumulated-persistence-style profiling so that it doesn't count 
     the frames contained in nested applications of a rule multiple times 
     toward that rule's frame count.</p><h4><a href="JAVA____JAVA.html">Java Library</a></h4><h5><a href="JAVA____ATJ.html">ATJ, the Java Code Generator for ACL2</a></h5><p>The implementation of ATJ has been improved 
     to use a more general abstract syntax and pretty-printer for Java 
     (which are currently part of the implementation of ATJ), 
     instead of writing directly to the output channel piecewise. 
     This provides more flexibility, and the ability to have more code 
     in logic mode and guard-verified.</p><p>ATJ has been extended with an option to generate Java code 
     according to a shallow embedding approach, 
     besides the previous deep embedding approach.</p><p>ATJ has been extended with an option to generate Java code 
     under the assumption that the guards are always satisfied. 
     This option should be used only with guard-verified ACL2 code 
     and with external Java code that calls the generated Java code 
     always with values that satisfy the guards.</p><p>ATJ has been extended with the ability to generate Java code 
     that operates on narrower types than the one for all ACL2 values. 
     This ability is available in the shallow embedding approach, 
     when guards are assumed satisfied.</p><p>ATJ has been extended with the ability to generate Java code 
     that uses Java primitive values and operations. 
     This ability is available in the shallow embedding approach, 
     when guards are assumed satisfied.</p><p>ATJ has been extended with the ability to generate Java code 
     that uses Java primitive arrays and operations, 
     and to destructively update arrays. 
     This ability is available in the shallow embedding approach, 
     when guards are assumed satisfied.</p><p>ATJ has been extended with the ability to generate Java loops 
     from tail-recursive ACL2 functions. 
     This ability is available in the shallow embedding approach, 
     when guards are assumed satisfied.</p><p>A comprehensive tutorial on ATJ has been started. 
     It is available at <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL.html">java::atj-tutorial</a></span>.</p><h5><a href="JAVA____AIJ.html">AIJ, the Deep Embedding of ACL2 into Java</a></h5><p>The return types of some of the methods that provide 
     native Java implementation of the ACL2 primitive functions 
     have been made more precise than the general type <span class="v">Acl2Value</span>. 
     For instance, the method for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> 
     now returns <span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span>.</p><p>Some of the native Java implementations of the ACL2 primitive functions 
     have been optimized.</p><p>Variant native Java implementations of the ACL2 primitive functions 
     have been added that operate 
     on narrower types than the one for all ACL2 values. 
     These are used by ATJ-generated code that operates on narrower types 
     (see release notes about ATJ).</p><p>Native Java implementations of a few more ACL2 built-in functions 
     have been added.</p><p>The documentation of AIJ has been extended and improved. 
     In particular, explicit preconditions have been added for public methods, 
     and explicit invariants have been added for non-public fields 
     and for arguments and results of non-public methods.</p><p>A number of JUnit unit tests have been added 
     for some of the AIJ Java code. 
     More unit tests are planned.</p><h5><a href="JAVA____LANGUAGE.html">Java Language Formalization</a></h5><p>An ABNF grammar has been added for the whole Java language, 
     consisting of the lexical and syntactic sub-grammars 
     from the Java language specification. 
     The grammar files have been parsed with <a href="ABNF____GRAMMAR-PARSER.html">the verified ABNF grammar parser</a>, obtaining a formal representation of the grammar of Java, 
     which can be used to formally specify. at a very high and assured level, 
     the concrete syntax of Java. 
     Various properties of the thus-obtained grammar representation (e.g. <a href="ABNF____CLOSURE.html">closure</a>) have been proved, for validation.</p><p>A model of Java Unicode characters has been added, 
     along with a model of their ASCII subset.</p><p>Models have been added 
     of the null and boolean literals, 
     of (non-restricted and restricted) keywords, 
     and of identifiers. 
     The consistency of these models with the grammar (see above) 
     has been proved.</p><p>Models have been added 
     of the decimal, hexadecimal, octal, and binary integer literals. 
     Abstract models have been added 
     of the floating-point literals. 
     Models have been added 
     of the character and string literals.</p><p>A model of the processing of Unicode escapes has been added. 
     This is Java's first lexical translation steps.</p><p>Models have been added of all the boolean and integer operations, 
     as well as of all the primitive conversions on integral values. 
     Abstract models have also been added of all the floating-point operations, 
     as well as of all the primitive conversions 
     involving floating-point values.</p><p>A model of (opaque) pointers has been added. 
     A model of reference values (consisting of pointers and a null reference) 
     has been added. 
     A model of all values, consisting of primitive and reference values, 
     has been added.</p><h4>Kestrel Utilities</h4><p>Note that some of the books below are not as polished as they could be.

     recursions by applying a set of rules referencing the <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> 
     formals and returns to determine what hypotheses to assume and conclusions 
     to prove about each function in the mutual recursion.</p><p><a href="ACL2____DEFRET.html">Defret</a> now substitutes the list of return value names for

     has been added, to introduce recursive functions 
     without having to prove termination right away. 
     There exist similar macros in the community books, 
     but the specifics of this new macro are motivated for use with <a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a>. See the `Related Tools' section 
     of the documentation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFARBREC.html">defarbrec</a></span> for more information. 
     This macro is currently in the Std/util extensions in the Kestrel Books, 
     but could be moved to <span class="v">[books]/std/util</span> at some point.</p><p>A new macro <span class="tt"><a href="STD____DEFFIXER.html">std::deffixer</a></span> has been added 
     that automates the definition of fixing functions, 
     and the generation of theorems about them, 
     according to a common pattern. 
     The macro can be extended to cover variations in the pattern if needed. 
     This can be used as a building block 
     for extending <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFIXTYPE.html">fty::deffixtype</a></span> to generate 
     not only the equivalence, but also the fixer for the fixtype.

     to establish isomorphic mappings by verification.</p><p>A new macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFMAX-NAT.html">defmax-nat</a></span> has been added, 
     to introduce functions to return maxima of sets of natural numbers.</p><h4>Tools</h4><p>The tool <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-HYPS.html">remove-hyps</a></span> no longer causes an error when the number of

     <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-HYPS.html">Remove-hyps</a></span> also avoids skipping proofs, which can lead to false 
     ``theorems''.  Thanks to Stephen Westfold for reporting this issue.</p><h4>Toothbrush</h4><p>Warnings have been eliminated when creating the file
