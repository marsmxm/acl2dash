<p>The relationship between guards and evaluation</p><p>For relevant background see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The guard has no effect on the logical axiom added by the 
 definition of a function.  It does, however, have consequences for how calls 
 of that function are evaluated in ACL2.  We begin by explaining those 
 consequences, when ACL2 is in its default ``mode,'' i.e., as originally 
 brought up.  In subsequent discussion we'll consider other ways that guards 
 can interact with evaluation.</p> 
 
 <p>For more about guards in general, see <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>.  For in-depth 
 discussion of the interaction between the <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> and guard 
 checking, see <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>, see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-EVALUATION-TABLE.html">guard-evaluation-table</a>, 
 see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-EVALUATION-EXAMPLES-SCRIPT.html">guard-evaluation-examples-script</a>, and see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-EVALUATION-EXAMPLES-LOG.html">guard-evaluation-examples-log</a>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____GENERALIZED-BOOLEANS.html">generalized-booleans</a> for 
 discussion about a subtle issue in the evaluation of certain Common Lisp 
 functions.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Guards and evaluation I: the default</i></p> 
 
 <p>Consider the following very simple definition.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>First consider how raw Common Lisp behaves when evaluating calls of this 
 function.  To evaluate <span class="v">(foo x)</span> for some expression <span class="v">x</span>, first <span class="v">x</span> 
 is evaluated to some value <span class="v">v</span>, and then <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))</span> is evaluated 
 with <span class="v">x</span> bound to <span class="v">v</span>.  For example, if <span class="v">v</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'a 3)</span>, then 
 Common Lisp computes <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 1 3)</span>.  But if (for example) <span class="v">v</span> is a 
 number, e.g., <span class="v">7</span>, then there is no way to predict what Common Lisp might 
 do.  Some implementations would cause ``sensible'' errors, others might return 
 nonsense, still others might crash the host machine.  The results tend toward 
 the catastrophic if the call of <span class="v">foo</span> in question is in compiled code.</p> 
 
 <p>Now by default, ACL2 evaluates calls of <span class="v">foo</span> exactly as Common Lisp 
 does, except that it uses guards to check the ``legality'' of each function 
 call.  So for example, since <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)</span> has a guard of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> x nil))</span>, the call <span class="v">(foo 7)</span> would cause a ``guard violation,'' as 
 illustrated below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(foo 7)

ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function symbol CDR, which
is (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">OR</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> X NIL)), is violated by the arguments in the
call (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">CDR</a> 7).

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, the relation between evaluation in ACL2 and evaluation in Common Lisp 
 is that the two produce the very same results, provided there is no guard 
 violation.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Guards and evaluation II:</i> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 logic is a logic of total functions.  That is, every application 
 of a function defined has a completely specified result.  See the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for each individual primitive for the specification of what it 
 returns when its guard is violated; for example, see <a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The presence of guards thus introduces a choice in the sense of evaluation. 
 When you type a form for evaluation do you mean for guards to be checked or 
 not?  Put another way, do you mean for the form to be evaluated in Common Lisp 
 (if possible) or in the ACL2 logic?  Note: If Common Lisp delivers an answer, 
 it will be the same as in the logic, but it might be erroneous to execute the 
 form in Common Lisp.  For example, the ACL2 logic definition of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> 
 implies that the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> of an <a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> is <span class="v">nil</span>; see <a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a>. 
 So: should <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> 7)</span> cause a guard violation error or return <span class="v">nil</span>?</p> 
 
 <p>The top-level ACL2 loop has a variable which controls which sense of 
 execution is provided.  By default, ``guard checking'' is on, by which we mean 
 that guards are checked at runtime, in the sense already described.  To allow 
 execution to proceed in the logic when there is a guard violation, do 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span><span class="v"> nil</span>; or evaluate <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span><span class="v"> :none</span> to skip guard checking entirely.  To turn 
 ``guard checking'' back on, execute the top-level form <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span><span class="v"> t</span>.  The status of guard checking reflected in the 
 <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a>; guard-checking is ``on'' when the <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a> contains an 
 exclamation mark (also see <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-PRINT-PROMPT.html">default-print-prompt</a>).  For example,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>means guard checking is on and</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 &gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>means guard checking is off.  The exclamation mark can be thought of as 
 ``barring'' certain computations.  The absence of the mark suggests the 
 absence of error messages or unbarred access to the logical axioms.  Thus, for 
 example</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 'abc)</pre> 
 
 <p>will signal an error, while</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 &gt;(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 'abc)</pre> 
 
 <p>will return <span class="v">nil</span>.  To return to our previous example: with guard 
 checking off, <span class="v">(foo 7)</span> evaluates to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 1 nil)</span>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Guards and evaluation III: guard verification</i></p> 
 
 <p>Consider the definition of <span class="v">foo</span> given above, but modified so that a 
 reasonable guard of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)</span> is specified, as shown below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>We say ``reasonable guard'' above because if <span class="v">x</span> is such that <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a>
 x)</span> holds, then the call of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> in the evaluation of <span class="v">(foo x)</span> 
 will not cause a guard violation.  Thus, it ``should'' be legal to evaluate 
 <span class="v">(foo x)</span>, for any such <span class="v">x</span>, simply by evaluating this form in raw 
 Common Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> event has been provided for this purpose. 
 Details may be found elsewhere; see <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>.  Briefly, for any 
 defined function <span class="v">fn</span>, the event <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> fn)</span> attempts to check 
 the condition discussed above, that whenever <span class="v">fn</span> is called on arguments 
 that satisfy its guard, the evaluation of this call will proceed without any 
 guard violation.  (Moreover, the guard itself should be evaluable without any 
 guard violation.)  If this check is successful, then future calls of this sort 
 will be evaluated in raw Common Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>Returning to our example above, the <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> foo)</span> will succeed 
 because the guard <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)</span> of <span class="v">foo</span> implies the guard generated from 
 the call <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)</span> in the body of the definition, namely, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> x nil))</span> (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a>).  Then the evaluation of <span class="v">(foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'a
 3))</span> will take place in raw Common Lisp, because <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'a 3)</span> satisfies 
 the guard of <span class="v">foo</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>This ability to dive into raw Common Lisp hinges on the proof that the 
 guards you attach to your own functions are sufficient to ensure that the 
 guards encountered in the body are satisfied.  This is called ``guard 
 verification.'' Once a function has had its guards verified, then ACL2 can 
 evaluate the function somewhat faster (but see ``Guards and evaluation V: 
 efficiency issues'' below).  Perhaps more importantly, ACL2 can also guarantee 
 that the function will be evaluated correctly by any implementation of Common 
 Lisp (provided the guard of the function is satisfied on the input).  That is, 
 if you have verified the guards of a system of functions and you have 
 determined that they work as you wish in your host ACL2 (perhaps by proving 
 it, perhaps by testing), then they will work identically in any Common 
 Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>There is a subtlety to our treatment of evaluation of calls of functions 
 whose guards have been verified.  If the function's guard is not satisfied by 
 such a call, then no further attempt is made to evaluate any call of that 
 function in raw lisp during the course of evaluation of that call.  This is 
 obvious if guard checking is on, because an error is signaled the first time 
 its guard is violated; but in fact it is also true when guard checking is off. 
 See <a href="ACL2____GUARD-EXAMPLE.html">guard-example</a> for an example.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Guards and evaluation IV: functions having :program mode</i></p> 
 
 <p>Strictly speaking, functions in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode (see <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>) do not have definitions in the ACL2 logic.  So what does it mean 
 to evaluate calls of such functions in ACL2?  In general we treat <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> functions much as we treat <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> functions whose guards 
 have been verified, except that when no error occurs then the corresponding 
 raw Lisp function is always called.  (We say ``in general'' because there are 
 exceptions, discussed in the ``Aside'' just below.)  Note that when the guard 
 of a function in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode is violated, there is still a value 
 that the ACL2 logic proves is equal to the given call.  But the same cannot be 
 said for a function in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode.  Nevertheless, for the sake 
 of convenience we go ahead and evaluate the corresponding raw Lisp function 
 except in the situation where the guard is violated and guard-checking is on, 
 aside from the following:</p> 
 
 <p><b>Aside</b>.  There are exceptions to the use of raw Lisp, discussed just 
 above, to evaluate calls of <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions.  The primary 
 one is that after <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span><span class="v"> :none</span>, evaluation of 
 user-defined <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode function calls is done in the ACL2 
 logic, not in raw Lisp.  The more obscure exception is that during expansion 
 of macros and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> forms, and during evaluation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span> forms, ACL2 enters a ``safe mode'' in which this escape to raw Lisp 
 is prevented.  The following example illustrates how the user can experiment 
 directly with safe mode, though it is preferred to use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span><span class="v"> :none</span> if you are happy to skip all guard checking and 
 evaluate forms in the logic.</p>

 <p><i>Guards and evaluation V: efficiency issues</i></p> 
 
 <p>We have seen that by verifying the guards for a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> 
 function, we arrange that raw lisp is used for evaluation of calls of such 
 functions when the arguments satisfy its guard.</p> 
 
 <p>This has several apparent advantages over the checking of guards as we go. 
 First, the savings is magnified as your system of functions gets deeper: the 
 guard is checked upon the top-level entry to your system and then raw Common 
 Lisp does all the computing.  Second, if the raw Common Lisp is compiled (see 
 <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a>), enormous speed-ups are possible.  Third, if your Common 
 Lisp or its compiler does such optimizations as <span class="v">tail-recursion</span> removal, 
 raw Common Lisp may be able to compute your functions on input much ``bigger'' 
 than ACL2 can.</p> 
 
 <p>The first of these advantages is quite important if you have complicated 
 guards.  However, the other two advantages are probably not very important, as 
 we now explain.</p> 
 
 <p>When a function is defined in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode, its <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> 
 is executed in raw Common Lisp; we call this the ``submitted'' definition of 
 the function.  However, a corresponding executable-counterpart also 
 executed.  (See <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a> for an introduction to submitted and 
 executable-counterpart definitions.)  The executable-counterpart is a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> in raw lisp that checks guards at runtime and escapes to the submitted 
 definition if the guard holds of the arguments and the function has already 
 had its guards verified.  Otherwise the executable-counterpart evaluates the 
 body of the function by calling the executable-counterpart of each subroutine. 
 Now it is true that <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> often speeds up execution 
 significantly.  However, the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span> command (see <a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a>) 
 compiles both of the raw lisp definitions associated with a function.  Also, 
 we have attempted to arrange that for every tail recursion removal done on the 
 actual <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, a corresponding tail recursion removal is done on the 
 executable-counterpart definition.</p> 
 
 <p>We believe that in most cases, the executable-counterpart executes almost 
 as fast as the submitted definition, at least if the evaluation of the guards 
 is fast.  So, the main advantage of guard verification is probably that it 
 lets you know that the submitted function may be executed safely in raw lisp, 
 returning the value predicted by the ACL2 logic, whenever its arguments 
 satisfy its guard.  We envision the development of systems of applicative lisp 
 functions that have been developed and reasoned about using ACL2 but which are 
 intended for evaluation in raw Common Lisp (perhaps with only a small ``core'' 
 of ACL2 loaded), so this advantage of guard verification is important.</p> 
 
 <p>Nevertheless, guard verification might be important for optimal efficiency 
 when the functions make use of type declarations.  For example, at this 
 writing, the GCL implementation of Common Lisp can often take great advantage 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> forms that assign small integer types to formal parameters. 
 Note that while type declarations contributed to the guard by default, they 
 can be proved from the guard instead; see <a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> for a discussion of the 
 <span class="v">:split-types</span> keyword.</p> 
 
 <p>To continue the discussion of guards, see <a href="ACL2____GUARDS-FOR-SPECIFICATION.html">guards-for-specification</a> 
 to read about the use of guards as a specification device.</p>
