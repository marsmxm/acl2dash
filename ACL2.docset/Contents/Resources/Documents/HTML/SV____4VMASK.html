<p>Bitmasks indicating the relevant bits of SVEX expressions.</p><p>A <b>4vmask</b> is a data structure that records which bits of an 
expression we care about.</p> 
 
<p>We represent 4vmasks as ordinary integers, which we treat as bit masks where 
1s encode the relevant bit positions and 0s encode the irrelevant positions. 
However, rather than directly using the <a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> type, we treat 4vmasks 
as a new, custom type, with its own recognizer, fixing function, etc.  This 
gives us a semantically nicer fixing behavior where the default mask is -1, 
i.e., by default all bits are relevant.</p> 
 
<p>4vmasks are intended to support <a href="SV____REWRITING.html">rewriting</a> and other applications, 
e.g., composing update functions to reach a fixpoint.  In these contexts, 
knowing that certain bits of an <a href="SV____SVEX.html">svex</a> expression are irrelevant can allow 
for additional simplifications.  For instance, in an expression like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(zerox 4 (bitand &lt;a&gt; &lt;b&gt;))</pre> 
 
<p>we can see that only the bottom four bits of <span class="v">&lt;a&gt;</span> and <span class="v">&lt;b&gt;</span> matter, 
because the zero extension will discard anything above four bits.  By taking 
advantage of this information, we may be able to simplify <span class="v">&lt;a&gt;</span> or <span class="v">&lt;b&gt;</span> 
in ways that are would otherwise not be sound.  For instance, if <span class="v">&lt;a&gt;</span> is an 
expression such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(concat 4 &lt;low&gt; &lt;high&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>Then we can simply rewrite it to <span class="v">&lt;low&gt;</span> and get rid of <span class="v">&lt;high&gt;</span> 
altogether.  Typically we make these sorts of inferences using <a href="SV____SVEX-ARGMASKS.html">svex-argmasks</a>.</p>
