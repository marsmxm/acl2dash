<p>Support for handling warnings and errors.</p><p>Many parts of VL can run into situations where we want to issue 
warnings or cause errors.  In these situations, VL creates <a href="VL____VL-WARNING.html">vl-warning</a> 
objects.  These warnings can be attached to major design elements such as 
modules and interfaces.  They can later be collected, examined, filtered, 
etc.</p> 
 
<p><b>New users:</b> You may wish to see <a href="VL____WARNING-BASICS.html">warning-basics</a> for a broad 
discussion of VL's philosophy toward handling warnings before looking at the 
functions below.</p> 
 
<h3>Quick Guide</h3> 
 
<p>VL includes many functions for creating, collecting, printing, filtering, 
and otherwise working with warnings.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The core warning data structure is a <a href="VL____VL-WARNING.html">vl-warning</a>, but more often 
these are found in a <a href="VL____VL-WARNINGLIST.html">vl-warninglist</a>, which are often called <i>warnings 
accumulators</i>.</li> 
 
<li>For <b>creating warnings</b>, there are some convenient macros for extend 
warnings accumulators with new warnings; see <a href="VL____OK.html">ok</a>, <a href="VL____WARN.html">warn</a>, <a href="VL____FATAL.html">fatal</a>.  As a new alternative to warnings accumulators, see also <a href="VL____VMSG.html">vmsg</a>, 
<a href="VL____VL-WARNING-ADD-CTX.html">vl-warning-add-ctx</a>, and the special <a href="VL____PATBIND-WMV.html">patbind-wmv</a> binder for <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a>.</li> 
 
<li>Functions for <b>displaying, filtering, etc.</b> a warning list include: 
<ul> 
  <li>
<a href="VL____VL-WARNINGS-TO-STRING.html">vl-warnings-to-string</a> and <a href="VL____VL-PRINT-WARNINGS.html">vl-print-warnings</a>
</li> 
  <li>
<a href="VL____VL-CLEAN-WARNINGS.html">vl-clean-warnings</a> and <a href="VL____VL-WARNING-SORT.html">vl-warning-sort</a>
</li> 
  <li>
<a href="VL____VL-KEEP-WARNINGS.html">vl-keep-warnings</a> and <a href="VL____VL-REMOVE-WARNINGS.html">vl-remove-warnings</a>
</li> 
  <li>
<a href="VL____VL-SOME-WARNING-FATALP.html">vl-some-warning-fatalp</a> and <a href="VL____VL-SOME-WARNING-OF-TYPE-P.html">vl-some-warning-of-type-p</a>.</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
 
<li>You can get a <a href="VL____VL-REPORTCARD.html">vl-reportcard</a> that <b>summarizes the warnings</b> that 
are attached to design elements such as modules, interfaces, etc.  A report 
card can also be printed, filtered, etc., see <a href="VL____VL-REPORTCARD.html">vl-reportcard</a> for details. 
You can alternately extract all of the warnings as a list of <a href="VL____FLAT-WARNINGS.html">flat-warnings</a>.</li> 
 
<li>Fatal warnings can be <b>propagated</b> throughout a design to transitively 
any superior design elements as having fatal warnings somewhere below.  See 
<a href="VL____PROPAGATING-ERRORS.html">propagating-errors</a>.</li> 
 
<li>VL hackers may want to know about <a href="VL____VL-TRACE-WARNINGS.html">vl-trace-warnings</a>, which just 
<b>traces warning creation</b> in a nice way so that you can see warnings as 
they are created (e.g., between print statements or other kinds of 
tracing.)</li> 
 
<li>Warnings are heavily used in <a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a>, which features some special 
mechanisms for <b>suppressing warnings</b>; see <a href="VL____LINT-WARNING-SUPPRESSION.html">lint-warning-suppression</a>.</li> 
 
</ul>
