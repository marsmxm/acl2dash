<p>Java integer operations [JLS:4.2.2].</p><p>Here we formalize all the unary and binary operations on integral values 
     that are not conversions (those are formalized separately). 
     The term `integer operations', as opposed to `integral operations', 
     is used in the title of [JLS:4.2.2].</p><p>Since integral values are subjected to 
     unary and binary numeric promotion [JLS:5.6] [JLS:15], 
     the operations on integral values actually only operate on 
     <span class="v">int</span> and <span class="v">long</span> values as operands.</p><p>For the shift operations [JLS:15.19], 
     unary numeric promotion is applied to the operands separately. 
     Thus, for each such operation, there are four variants, 
     corresponding to each operand being <span class="v">int</span> or <span class="v">long</span>.</p><p>Some integer operations have boolean results.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.2] also lists the prefix and posfix <span class="v">++</span> and <span class="v">--</span> operators, 
     but those operate on variables, not just values, 
     and therefore must be formalized elsewhere.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.2] also lists the conditional operator <span class="v">? :</span>, 
     but that one is non-strict, 
     and therefore must be formalized as part of expression evaluation.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.2] also lists the string concatenation operator <span class="v">+</span>, 
     but that is best formalized in terms of integral-to-string conversions, 
     elsewhere.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.2] also lists the cast operator, which involves conversions, 
     which, as mentioned above, are formalized separately.</p>
