<p>Axe Lifters</p><p>The Axe toolkit provides several tools for lifting code into logic.  Currently, Axe can lift JVM bytecode, x86 binaries, and rank-1 constraint systems.</p><p>   For lifting JVM bytecode, four lifters are available.  For code that is unrollable, use <a href="ACL2____UNROLL-JAVA-CODE.html">unroll-java-code</a> (or try the more experimental <a href="ACL2____UNROLL-JAVA-CODE2.html">unroll-java-code2</a>, for compositional lifting).  When loops cannot be unrolled and so must be lifted into recursive functions, use <span class="v">lift-java-code</span> (or try the more experimental <span class="v">lift-java-code2</span>, for compositional lifting).</p><p>   For lifting x86 binaries, two lifters are available.  For code that is unrollable, use <span class="v">x::def-unrolled</span> (still experimental).  When loops cannot be unrolled and so must be lifted into recursive functions, try <span class="v">x::lift-subroutine</span> (very experimental).</p><p>   For lifting rank-1 constraint systems, use <a href="R1CS____LIFT-R1CS.html">r1cs::lift-r1cs</a> or one of its variants.</p>
