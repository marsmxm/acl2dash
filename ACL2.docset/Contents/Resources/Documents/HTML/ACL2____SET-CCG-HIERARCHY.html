General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CCG-HIERARCHY.html">set-ccg-hierarchy</a> v)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">v</span> is <span class="v">:CCG-ONLY</span>, <span class="v">:CCG-ONLY-CPN</span>, <span class="v">:HYBRID</span>, 
 <span class="v">:HYBRID-CPN</span>, or a non-empty list of hierarchy levels, which either have 
 the form <span class="v">(pt ccm-cs cpn)</span> or the form <span class="v">(:measure pt)</span>, where <span class="v">pt</span> is 
 either <span class="v">:built-in-clauses</span> or <span class="v">(:induction-depth n)</span> for some natural 
 number <span class="v">n</span>, <span class="v">ccm-cs</span> is one of <span class="v">:EQUAL</span>, <span class="v">:ALL</span>, <span class="v">:SOME</span>, or 
 <span class="v">:NONE</span>, and <span class="v">cpn</span> is <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Each level of the hierarchy describes techniques used to prove 
 termination. Termination proofs performed after admitting this event will use 
 the specified techniques in the order in which they are listed.</p> 
 
 <p>Basically, the CCG analysis as described and illustrated at a high level in 
 the documentation for <a href="ACL2____CCG.html">ccg</a> can potentially be very expensive. In order 
 to make the analysis as efficient as possible, we use less expensive (and less 
 powerful) techniques first, and resort to more powerful and expensive 
 techniques only when these fail.</p> 
 
 <p>There are three ways of varying the CCG analysis, which are represented by 
 each of the three elements in a hierarchy level (levels of the form 
 <span class="v">(:measure pt)</span> will be explained later).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Pt</span> tells the CCG analysis how to limit proof attempts. The idea behind 
 this is that ACL2 is designed to prove statements that the user thinks are 
 true. It therefore does everything it can to prove the conjecture. As ACL2 
 useres already know, this can lead to very long, or even non-terminating proof 
 attempts. The CCG analysis, on the other hand, sends multiple queries to the 
 theorem prover that may or may not be true, in order to improve the accuracy 
 of the analysis. It is therefore necessary to reign in ACL2's proof attempts 
 to keep them from taking too long. Of course, the trade-off is that, the more 
 we limit ACL2's prover, the less powerful it becomes.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Pt</span> can be <span class="v">:built-in-clauses</span>, which tells ACL2 to use only <a href="ACL2____BUILT-IN-CLAUSE.html">built-in-clause</a>s analysis. This is a very fast, and surprisingly powerful 
 proof technique. For example, the definition of Ackermann's function given in 
 the documentation for <a href="ACL2____CCG.html">ccg</a> is solved using only this proof 
 technique.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Pt</span> can also be of the form <span class="v">(:induction-depth n)</span>, where <span class="v">n</span> is 
 a natural number. This uses the full theorem prover, but limits it in two 
 ways. First, it stops proof attempts if ACL2 has been working on a subgoal 
 with no case splitting or induction for 20 steps (that is, at a goal of the 
 form 1.5'20'). It also limits the <i>induction depth</i>, which describes how 
 many times we allow induction goals to lead to further induction goals. For 
 example, <span class="v">(:induction-depth 0)</span> allows no induction, while 
 <span class="v">(:induction-depth 1)</span> allows goals of the form <span class="v">*1</span> or <span class="v">*2</span>, but 
 stops if it creates a goal such as <span class="v">*1.1</span> or <span class="v">*2.1</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Ccm-cs</span> limits which CCMs are compared using the theorem 
 prover. Consider again the <span class="v">ack</span> example in the documentation for <a href="ACL2____CCG.html">ccg</a>. All we needed was to compare the value of <span class="v">(acl2s-size x)</span> before and 
 after the recursive call and the value of <span class="v">(acl2s-size y)</span> before and after 
 the recursive call. We would learn nothing, and waste time with the theorem 
 prover if we compared <span class="v">(acl2s-size x)</span> to <span class="v">(acl2s-size y)</span>. However, 
 other times, it is important to compare CCMs with each other, for example, 
 when arguments are permuted, or we are dealing with a mutual recursion.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Ccm-cs</span> can be one of <span class="v">:EQUAL</span>, <span class="v">:ALL</span>, <span class="v">:SOME</span>, or 
 <span class="v">:NONE</span>. These limit which CCMs we compare based on the variables they 
 mention. Let <span class="v">c</span> be a recursive call in the body of function <span class="v">f</span> that 
 calls function <span class="v">g</span>. Let <span class="v">m1</span> be a CCM for <span class="v">f</span> and <span class="v">m2</span> be a CCM 
 for <span class="v">g</span>. Let <span class="v">v1</span> be the formals mentioned in <span class="v">m1</span> and <span class="v">v2</span> be the 
 formals mentioned in <span class="v">m2'</span> where <span class="v">m2'</span> is derived from <span class="v">m2</span> by 
 substituting the formals of <span class="v">g</span> with the actuals of <span class="v">c</span>. For example, 
 consider following function:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> x)
      0
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1_B2.html">1+</a> (f (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now consider the case where <span class="v">m1</span> and <span class="v">m2</span> are both the measure 
 <span class="v">(acl2s-size x)</span>. Then if we look at the recursive call <span class="v">(f (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))</span> in 
 the body of <span class="v">f</span>, then <span class="v">m2'</span> is the result of replacing <span class="v">x</span> with 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)</span> in <span class="v">m2</span>, i.e., <span class="v">(acl2s-size (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">ccm-cs</span> is <span class="v">:EQUAL</span> we will compare <span class="v">m1</span> to <span class="v">m2</span> if <span class="v">v1</span> 
 and <span class="v">v2</span> are equal. If <span class="v">value</span> is <span class="v">:ALL</span> we will compare <span class="v">m1</span> to 
 <span class="v">m2'</span> if <span class="v">v2</span> is a subset of <span class="v">v1</span>. If <span class="v">value</span> is <span class="v">:SOME</span> we 
 will compare <span class="v">m1</span> to <span class="v">m2'</span> if <span class="v">v1</span> and <span class="v">v2</span> intersect. If 
 <span class="v">value</span> is <span class="v">:NONE</span> we will compare <span class="v">m1</span> to <span class="v">m2</span> no matter 
 what.</p> 
 
 <p>There is one caveat to what was just said: if <span class="v">m1</span> and <span class="v">m2</span> are 
 syntactically equal, then regardless of the value of <span class="v">ccm-cs</span> we will 
 construct a CCMF that will indicate that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____O_E3_D3.html">o&gt;=</a> m1 m2)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Cpn</span> tells us how much ruler information we will use to compare CCMs. 
 Unlike ACL2's measure-based termination analysis, CCG has the ability to use 
 the rulers from both the current recursive call the next recursive call when 
 constructing the CCMFs. That is, instead of asking ``What happens when I make 
 recursive call A?'', we can ask, ``What happens when execution moves from 
 recursive call A to recursive call B?''. Using this information potentially 
 strengthens the termination analysis. For a brief example, consider the 
 following code:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> half (x)
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> x)
       0
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1_B2.html">1+</a> (half (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> x 2)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Clearly this is terminating. If we choose a measure of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> x)</span> we 
 know that if <span class="v">x</span> is a positive integer, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> x 2))</span> is less than 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> x)</span>. But consider the measure <span class="v">(acl2s-size x)</span>. The strange thing 
 here is that if <span class="v">x</span> is 1, then <span class="v">(acl2s-size (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> x 2))</span> is <span class="v">(acl2s-size
 -1)</span>, which is 1, i.e. the <span class="v">acl2s-size</span> of <span class="v">x</span>. So, the fact that we 
 know that <span class="v">x</span> is a positive integer is not enough to show that this measure 
 decreases. But notice that if <span class="v">x</span> is 1, we will recur just one more 
 time. So, if we consider what happens when we move from the recursive call 
 back to itself. In this case we know <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> x)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> x
 2))))</span>.  Under these conditions, it is trivial for ACL2 to prove that 
 <span class="v">(acl2s-size (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> x 2))</span> is always less than <span class="v">(acl2s-size x)</span>. 
 
 However, this can make the CCG analysis much more expensive, since information 
 about how values change from step to step are done on a per-edge, rather than 
 a per-node basis in the CCG (where the nodes are the recursive calls and the 
 edges indicate that execution can move from one call to another in one 
 step). Thus, calculating CCMFs (how values change across recursive calls) on a 
 per-edge basis rather than a per-node basis can require n^2 instead of n 
 prover queries.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">cpn</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, we will use only the ruler of the current recursive 
 call to compute our CCMFs. If it is <span class="v">nil</span>, we will use the much more 
 expensive technique of using the rulers of the current and next call.</p> 
 
 <p>Levels of the hierarchy of the form <span class="v">(:measure pt)</span> specify that the CCG 
 analysis is to be set aside for a step, and the traditional measure-based 
 termination proof is to be attempted. Here, <span class="v">pt</span> has the same meaning as it 
 does in a CCG hierarchy level. That is, it limits the measure proof in order 
 to avoid prohibitively long termination analyses.</p> 
 
 <p>The user may specify their own hierarchy in the form given above. The main 
 restriction is that no level may be subsumed by an earlier level. That is, it 
 should be the case at each level of the hierarchy, that it is possible to 
 discover new information about the CCG that could help lead to a termination 
 proof.</p> 
 
 <p>In addition to constructing his or her own CCG hierarchy, the user may use 
 several preset hierarchies:</p>
