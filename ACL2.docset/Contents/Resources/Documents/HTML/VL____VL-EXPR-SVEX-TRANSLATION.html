<p>Compilation from (sized) <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> expressions into <a href="SV____SVEX.html">sv::svex</a> expressions.</p><p>There are several top-level functions for converting a VL 
expression into a <a href="SV____SVEX.html">sv::svex</a> expression, including <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-TO-SVEX-UNTYPED.html">vl-expr-to-svex-untyped</a>, <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-TO-SVEX-SELFDET.html">vl-expr-to-svex-selfdet</a>, and <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-TO-SVEX-MAYBE-TYPED.html">vl-expr-to-svex-maybe-typed</a>.</p> 
 
<p>We assume that the expressions we are dealing with are sized.</p> 
 
<p><b>The Garbage Convention</b>. Our goal is to produce svex expressions that 
are "correct" at least for this size.  We don't care about the bits that are 
"past" the expression's final width.</p> 
 
<p>For example, if we are converting <span class="v">3'b100</span> into an svex expression, it 
would be valid to just use <span class="v">(concat 3 #b100 anything)</span>.</p> 
 
<p>This has widespread consequences.</p> 
 
<p>In many cases, we don't have to worry about the upper bits, because we know, 
for instance, that after sizing, in a VL expression like <span class="v">a &amp; b</span>, that the 
widths of <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">b</span> agree with the final width of the whole <span class="v">a &amp; b</span> 
expression.  So any "garbage" in the upper bits can only affect the upper bits 
of the result.</p> 
 
<p>However, in certain cases we have to be more careful.  For instance, if we 
are translating <span class="v">a &lt; b</span>, then the svex semantics are that we do an infinite 
width comparison, so we need to be careful to properly sign/zero extend the two 
arguments to their appropriate, final value.</p> 
 
<p>Why do it this way?  Some possible alternatives:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Force everything past the final width to X.</li> 
 
<li>Sign/zero extend everything so that every expression is correct out to 
infinite width.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Forcing the high bits to X has some appeal: it would be nice to know that 
any accidental use of the upper bits would be conservative.  In most ways it 
would be very similar to what we are doing now: we would still have to be 
careful in cases like <span class="v">a &lt; b</span> to mask out those Xes.  But we would also have 
to do more to ensure that we were following this convention.  For instance, by 
not caring about the upper bits, we don't have to do anything special when 
translating sums: the carry from <span class="v">a + b</span> can go into the upper bits and it's 
just garbage.  If we wanted all the upper bits to be X, we'd need to do extra 
work to mask them out in this case.</p> 
 
<p>The other alternative seems sort of more proactive: we would essentially be 
fixing everything up to be the right size whether it needs to be fixed up or 
not.  For instance, if we are translating something like <span class="v">(a + b) &amp; c</span>, we 
don't really need to know the true upper bits of <span class="v">a + b</span> or <span class="v">c</span>.  We 
suspect that arranging for every expression to be correct out to infinite width 
would therefore incur some overhead.</p>
