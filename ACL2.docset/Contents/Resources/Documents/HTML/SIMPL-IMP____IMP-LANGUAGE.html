<p>An ACL2 library for the simple programming language Imp.</p><p>Imp is a simple programming language, 
     used mainly for didactic purposes. 
     It is found (with small variations) in textbooks and course materials, 
     such as:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/15414/lectures/10-semantics.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>The `Automatic Program Verification and Testing' lecture slides.<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mfredrik/15414/lectures/10-semantics.pdf"></nobr></a></li>
<li><a href="https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/Imp.html" target="_blank"><nobr>The `Software Foundations' book series.<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/current/lf-current/Imp.html"></nobr></a></li>
<li><a href="http://concrete-semantics.org" target="_blank"><nobr>The `Concrete Semantics' book.<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://concrete-semantics.org"></nobr></a></li>
</ul><p>This library contains a formalization of Imp in ACL2, 
     and is expected to be extended with additional material 
     related to formal verification and synthesis of Imp programs. 
     The package name of this library, <span class="v">"SIMPL-IMP"</span>, 
     consists of `SIMPL' for `Simple Programming Language' 
     (where the `P' can be in either word) 
     and `IMP' for `Imp'. 
     ACL2 libraries for other simple programming languages could use 
     a similar package <span class="v">"SIMPL-..."</span> package naming scheme.</p><p>Imp is informally defined by the following elements:</p><ul>
<li>Arithmetic expressions, 
      consisting of 
      integer constants (of any size), 
      variables (i.e. symbolic names), 
      and a few arithmetic operators like addition and multiplication. 
      These expressions are always integer-valued, 
      without any size limitations; 
      the arithmetic operators are exact, i.e. not modular.</li>
<li>Boolean expressions, 
      consisting of 
      boolean constants (one for truth and one for falsehood), 
      equalities and inequalities of arithmetic expressions, 
      boolean negation, 
      and boolean conjunction. 
      These expressions are always boolean-valued.</li>
<li>Commands (i.e. statements), 
      consisting of 
      assignments of arithmetic expressions to variables, 
      sequencing (i.e. following a command with another command), 
      conditionals (`if-then-else'), 
      and loops. 
      These commands operate on a state consisting of 
      values stored in variables.</li>
</ul><p>Imp does not have user-defined functions or procedures. 
     An Imp program is a command, which operates on a variable store. 
     Variables always contain integers (of any size); 
     they do not contain booleans.</p>
