<p>Please see <a href="SVL____SVL-RUN-PHASE.html">svl-run-phase</a> for the explanation of the 
arguments. svl-run-phase-wog has the same functionality as svl-run-phase but it 
does not have any guards. This can help makes the rewrite-based proof go faster 
because guards might be executed too many times during such proofs.</p>
