<p>Synthesize simple edge-triggered <span class="v">always</span> blocks into primitives.</p><p>This is our "final," transformation for synthesizing 
edge-triggered always blocks into primitives.  This transform supports only a 
limited subset of Verilog statements.  Generally speaking, VL can handle a much 
richer subset of Verilog statements than we are going to deal with here.  Other 
<a href="VL2014____TRANSFORMS.html">transforms</a>—e.g., <a href="VL2014____STMTREWRITE.html">stmtrewrite</a>, <a href="VL2014____CASEELIM.html">caseelim</a>, and <a href="VL2014____EDGESPLIT.html">edgesplit</a>—are typically first used to reduce these much richer 
statements into the simple form that we now target.</p> 
 
<p>Despite the many limits we place on the Verilog statements that we do try to 
support here, synthesizing edge-triggered always blocks is still difficult to 
do in a way that is completely faithful to the Verilog semantics.  We describe 
some of the challenges and our general approach below.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Preliminaries: Edge-Triggered Blocks, Clocks</h3> 
 
<p><u>Definition.</u> We say that an <span class="v">always</span> block is <b>edge-triggered</b> 
when it contains a <a href="VL2014____VL-TIMINGSTMT.html">vl-timingstmt</a> whose control is a list of <span class="v">posedge</span> 
or <span class="v">negedge</span> events.  As examples:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(posedge clk) ... ;                  // edge-triggered
always @(negedge clk) ... ;                  // edge-triggered
always @(posedge clk or negedge reset) ... ; // edge-triggered

always @(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a>) ... ;                            // not edge-triggered
always @(a or b or c) ... ;                  // not edge-triggered
always @(posedge clk or a) ... ;             // not edge-triggered
always #3 ... ;                              // not edge-triggered
always begin ... end ;                       // not edge-triggered</pre> 
 
<p>Throughout this discussion, we will assume that we are attempting to 
synthesize an edge-triggered always block.  Some other kinds of <span class="v">always</span> 
blocks are supported by other VL transforms, e.g., the <a href="VL2014____CBLOCK.html">cblock</a> transform 
can process certain kinds of combinational always blocks.  But we aren't going 
to try to cover any of that, here.</p> 
 
<p>For many years, VL only supported edge-triggered always blocks that had a 
single <span class="v">posedge</span> or <span class="v">negedge</span> trigger.  We now support arbitrary lists of 
<span class="v">posedge</span> and <span class="v">negedge</span> edges.  That is, we can now handle always blocks 
such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(posedge a or negedge b or posedge c or ...)
begin
   // restricted statements as explained below
end</pre> 
 
<p><u>Definition</u>.  We say that the <b>clocks</b> of such an always block 
are the expressions in the sensitivity list, regardless of whether they are 
used with <span class="v">posedge</span> or <span class="v">negedge</span> specifiers.  For instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">// example:                                  // clocks (<a href="VL2014____EXPRESSIONS.html">expressions</a>)
always @(posedge clk) ...;                   //   clk
always @(posedge mclk or negedge reset) ...; //   mclk, reset
always @(posedge a &amp; b or posedge c[0]) ...; //   a &amp; b, c[0]</pre> 
 
<p>We only support always blocks whose clocks are each <b>one-bit wide, plain 
identifiers</b>.  Why?</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The width restriction is meant to avoid mismatches between Verilog tools: 
we have found that various Verilog simulators do not agree about what 
constitutes an edge for a wide signal.  At any rate, it would be weird to ask 
about the edge of a wide signal.</li> 
 
<li>Requiring the clock be a plain identifier is a significant help in keeping 
our processing code more simple.  We'll soon describe some of the timing 
nuances that make it important to be able to distinguishing clocks from 
non-clocks in <span class="v">if</span> statements and right-hand sides of expressions.  We think 
this restriction is probably not too severe, as most reasonable designs will 
not include, e.g., vectors of clocks.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h3>Synthesis Challenge: X Optimism</h3> 
 
<p>One basic problem in synthesizing edge-triggered <span class="v">always</span> blocks (or any 
other kind of <span class="v">always</span> blocks, for that matter) is the unwarranted optimism 
of <span class="v">if</span> statements.</p> 
 
<p>Suppose for simplicity that <span class="v">en</span> is one bit wide.  In the Verilog 
semantics, a statement like <span class="v">if (en) q &lt;= d</span> causes an update to <span class="v">q</span> only 
if <span class="v">en</span> evaluates to 1.  If <span class="v">en</span> instead evaluates to X or Z, the <span class="v">if</span> 
statement <b>pretends it evaluated to 0</b> and does not update <span class="v">q</span>.  This 
is generally bad, as it fails to properly treat X as an unknown.</p> 
 
<p>When we synthesize these always blocks for use with properly monotonic 
back-ends like <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>, where X really does represent an unknown, we have 
no way to model this kind of optimism.  Instead, roughly speaking, we are going 
to treat these statements like <span class="v">?:</span> operators, which have safer but 
different X behavior.  That is, in our semantics, when <span class="v">en</span> evaluates to X 
or Z, we may write an X value into <span class="v">q</span> instead of failing to update it.</p> 
 
<p>We cannot see any way to avoid this kind of mismatch.  We generally regard 
the <span class="v">?:</span> behavior as more reasonable and safer.  But it's easy to imagine 
that if <span class="v">q</span> is later fed into other, non-conservative Verilog 
constructs (such as if statements, case/casex/casez statements, case equality 
operators, etc.), then a Verilog simulator could go produce completely 
different results than, say, an esim-based simulation.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Synthesis Challenge: Clock/Data Races</h3> 
 
<p>A much more subtle and tricky problem is the event-based Verilog timing 
model allows for a number of races between the clock signals and the data 
inputs.  To illustrate this, consider the following examples:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">// Version 1:

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
  q &lt;= reset ? 0 : data;

// Version 2:

wire q_next;
assign q_next = reset ? 0 : data;
always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
  q &lt;= q_next;</pre> 
 
<p>You might hope these would behave the same.  After all, it looks like the 
only difference is that we've named an intermediate expression.  Unfortunately, 
Version 2 has a race condition in Verilog simulators.  In Version 2, when 
<span class="v">reset</span> transitions from low to high, two separate events need to be 
scheduled: the <span class="v">assign</span> and the <span class="v">always</span> block.  These events may occur 
in any order, so we may find that either:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The <span class="v">assign</span> statement happens first, so <span class="v">q_next</span> "properly" is 
updated to 0 before the <span class="v">always</span> block updates <span class="v">q</span>, or</li> 
 
<li>The <span class="v">always</span> statement happens first, so <span class="v">q_next</span> "improperly" has 
the old value of <span class="v">data</span> when we assign it to <span class="v">q</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>(If you run these on a Verilog simulator and find that they simulate in the 
same way, try reordering the assignment and the always block and you may get a 
different result.)</p> 
 
<p>In contrast, at least in Verilog's simulation semantics, Version 1 does not 
suffer from this problem and will "properly" reset <span class="v">q</span>.  The reason this 
works is that there are no competing events are triggered by the transition of 
<span class="v">reset</span>; only the single <span class="v">always</span> block must be run.</p> 
 
<p>Here is an attempt to visualize what we might be modeling when we write 
these two fragments of Verilog.</p> 
 
<div class="ximg"><img src="../res/vl/always/edgesynth_reset.png"></div> 
 
<p>Version 1 might be sensible.  If this handling of <span class="v">reset</span> is to be an 
intrinsic part of the always block, a circuit designer might be able to design 
something that implements it correctly.</p> 
 
<p>But Version 2 is clearly not okay.  Here, with the muxing done independently 
of the flop, we can see that a change in reset is going to trigger an update in 
both the flop itself and in the mux that is feeding the flop.  This is a clear 
race.</p> 
 
<p>The fanciful "horrible circuit" is similar to Version 2, but made worse 
just to drive the point home.  Imagine here that the adder is some large 
circuit with some large delay.  When reset goes high, the flip-flop is 
triggered and, meanwhile, the adder's inputs have changed, so it will be busily 
transitioning to compute the new sum.  The value that gets latched in, then, is 
anyone's guess.  Clearly you would never want to design something like 
this.</p> 
 
<p>At any rate, if we regard the right-hand sides of assignments in an 
edge-triggered always block as the data inputs to flip-flops, then for our 
design to make any sense, we really need these data inputs to be stable 
whenever a clock changes.  For that to hold, these assignments should, at the 
very least, <b>not depend on the clocks</b> of the always block.</p> 
 
<p>This is difficult to reliably identify syntactically.  Even in a simple case 
like Version 2, we would need to analyze the assignments that are occurring in 
the module to discover that <span class="v">q_next</span> depends on <span class="v">reset</span>.  If <span class="v">q_next</span> 
were instead driven by some submodule, then noticing this would require an 
analysis of that submodule.  Aliasing makes this much worse, e.g., what if we 
have something like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire my_clk = real_clk;
always @(posedge my_clk) q &lt;= real_clk;</pre> 
 
<p>At any rate, detecting this situation seems very difficult, so we have not 
seriously considered trying to identify these races.  We do, however, at least 
forbid the clocks from occurring in the right hand sides of expressions.</p> 
 
<p>This may seem quite unsatisfying—it rules out Version 1 and doesn't 
rule out Version 2!  But this restriction is practically very useful.  It means 
that for the blocks we <i>do</i> support, it's reasonable to move the 
right-hand sides out of the always block.  That is, it makes it safe to do 
something like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
  if (reset)
     q &lt;= 0;
  else
     q &lt;= q+1;
--&gt;

assign q_next = q+1;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
  if (reset)
     q &lt;= 0;
  else
     q &lt;= q_next;</pre> 
 
<p>This sort of reassignment wouldn't be valid if the right-hand side 
expression mentioned any of the clocks, as we have just beaten to death, 
above.  (It's the whole difference between Version 1 and Version 2).</p> 
 
 
<h3>Historic Approach to Edge-Triggered Blocks</h3> 
 
<p>Before describing our new approach, it's useful to describe the old way that 
VL handled edge-triggered blocks.  Previously, VL supported only basic, 
single-edge registers, and reduced all supported always blocks into instances 
of a single, 1-bit flip-flop primitive.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module VL_1_BIT_FLOP (q, d, clk);
  output reg q;
  input d;
  input clk;
  always @(posedge clk)
    q &lt;= d;
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Given this primitive, it was straightforward to implement a simple, 
posedge-triggered, <i>N</i>-bit flip-flop: just instance <i>N</i> of these 
primitive flops, one for each bit.  We named the resulting modules, e.g., 
<span class="v">VL_4_BIT_FLOP</span>, <span class="v">VL_128_BIT_FLOP</span>, and so forth, for any <i>N</i>.</p> 
 
<p>We then had a transformation that could support basic <span class="v">always</span> blocks by 
converting them into instances of an appropriately sized flop module.  For 
instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(posedge clk)
  q &lt;= a + b + cin;
 ---&gt;
VL_12_BIT_FLOP foo123 (q, a + b + cin, clk);</pre> 
 
<p>Our transform could also support always blocks with limited if/else 
expressions, by merging the if/else structure into the data input.  For 
instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(posedge clk)
begin
  if (cycle)
     q &lt;= 12'b0;
  else
     q &lt;= a + b + cin;
end
---&gt;
VL_12_BIT_FLOP foo123 (q, cycle ? 12'b0 : a + b + cin, clk);</pre> 
 
<p>Along with other transforms, e.g., for converting <span class="v">negedge</span> into posedge 
signals by inverting them, this allowed VL to support a fairly rich set of 
single-edge always blocks.  Meanwhile, back-end tools like <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> only 
needed to support a single VL_1_BIT_FLOP primitive.  Historically this was done 
using a traditional master/slave latch style.</p> 
 
 
<h3>New Primitives</h3> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, we don't how we can construct a multi-edge flip flop out of a 
single-edge flip-flop.  To allow VL to support <span class="v">always</span> blocks with multiple 
edges, then, we need new primitives.</p> 
 
<p>After studying the kinds of multi-edge flops that we wanted to support, we 
decided that what we really want is a flip-flop with a built-in priority mux 
that is governed by the clock edges.  Our new, simplest flip-flop primitive is 
just like the previous VL_1_BIT_FLOP:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module VL_1_BIT_1_EDGE_FLOP (q, d, clk);
  output reg q;
  input d;
  input clk;
  always @(posedge clk)
    q &lt;= d;
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>The next simplest primitive has two clocks and two data signals.  We assume 
that one clock has priority over the other.  This module is just a slight 
generalization of, e.g., Version 1 of the resettable mux that we saw above, 
where instead of necessarily resetting to zero we can choose between two 
arbitrary data inputs.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module VL_1_BIT_2_EDGE_FLOP (q, d0, d1, clk0, clk1);
 output reg q;
 input d0, d1;
 input clk0, clk1;
 always @(posedge clk0 or posedge clk1)
   if (clk0)
      q &lt;= d0
   else
      q &lt;= d1;
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p><b>BOZO</b> consider using ?: instead of IF here for the Verilog definition.</p> 
 
<p>For three clocks we simply add another clock and data input, extending the 
priority mux.  This module could be used to model, e.g., a flip-flop with 
asynchronous set and clears, e.g., by allowing <span class="v">d0 = 1</span> and <span class="v">d1 = 0</span> or 
vice versa depending on the desired priority of set versus clear.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module VL_1_BIT_3_EDGE_FLOP (q, d0, d1, d2, clk0, clk1, clk2);
 output reg q;
 input d0, d1;
 input clk0, clk1;
 always @(posedge clk0 or posedge clk1 or posedge clk2)
   if (clk0)
      q &lt;= d0
   else if (clk1)
      q &lt;= d1;
   else
      q &lt;= d2;
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Although we don't know what use there would be for such a flip-flop with 
more than three clocks and data inputs, we can continue this way, adding more 
clocks and data inputs, up to any number desired.  See <a href="VL2014____NEDGEFLOP.html">nedgeflop</a> for 
more details about how we generate these primitives.</p> 
 
<p>Given these new primitives, we can still construct wide flip-flops by 
chaining together one-bit primitive flops.</p> 
 
<p>The remaining challenge is to line up edge-triggered <span class="v">always</span> with 
instances of these primitives.</p>
