 <p>Computing machines, whether hardware or software or some combination, are 
 frequently modeled as ``state machines.''</p> 
 
 <p>To so model a computing machine we must represent its <b>states</b> as 
 objects in our mathematical framework.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Transitions</b> are functions or relations on state objects.</p> 
 
 <p>In what language shall we define these objects, functions, and 
 relations?</p> 
 
 <p>The mathematical languages we were taught in high school</p> 
 
 <p><b>algebra</b>,</p> 
 
 <p><b>geometry</b>,</p> 
 
 <p><b>trigonometry</b>, and</p> 
 
 <p><b>calculus</b></p> 
 
 <p>are often inappropriate for modeling digital systems.  They primarily let 
 us talk about numbers and continuous functions.</p> 
 
 <p>To see what kind of expressive power we need, take a closer look at what a 
 typical state contains.</p>
