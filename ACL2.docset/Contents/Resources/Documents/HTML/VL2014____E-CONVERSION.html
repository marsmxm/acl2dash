<p>Translation from simplified Verilog modules into E modules.</p><p>The conversion from Verilog to E is mostly straightforward because 
here we only try to support an extremely limited subset of Verilog.  The basic 
idea is that other <a href="VL2014____TRANSFORMS.html">transforms</a> should first be used to simplify more 
complex, "original" input modules into this simple subset.</p> 
 
<p>Here are some basic expectations:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Each module we need to process will include net declarations and submodule 
instances, but will not have any assignments, gates, always blocks, parameters, 
registers, variables, etc.  These other constructs should be simplified away 
before E conversion.</li> 
 
<li>Each module instance will have well-formed port connections that contain 
only <a href="VL2014____EXPR-SLICING.html">sliceable</a> expressions.  This lets 
us deal with everything purely at the bit level.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>We have checks to ensure our assumptions hold, and these checks will result 
in fatal <a href="VL2014____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> if the modules contain unsupported constructs.  See in 
particular <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-CHECK-E-OK.html">vl-module-check-e-ok</a> and <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-CHECK-PORT-BITS.html">vl-module-check-port-bits</a>.</p> 
 
<p>We process the modules in dependency order, and aside from sanity checking 
there are basically two steps for each module we need to convert:</p> 
 
<ol> 
 
<li>We produce a <b>preliminary</b> E module by <a href="VL2014____EXPLODING-VECTORS.html">exploding</a> the module's vectors into individual bits, 
and converting the module instances into E occurrences for the submodules.</li> 
 
<li>This preliminary E module is almost a proper E module, but it might have 
some wires that are driven by multiple occurrences.  As a second step, we 
rewrite the preliminary module to <a href="VL2014____RESOLVING-MULTIPLE-DRIVERS.html">resolve these multiply driven wires</a>.  This 
ensures that every wire has exactly one driver.</li> 
 
</ol> 
 
<p>Some final sanity checking is done to ensure that the module's inputs and 
outputs are properly marked and there is no "backflow" occurring.</p> 
 
<p>The resulting E module for each Verilog module is saved in the <span class="v">esim</span> 
field of each <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-P.html">vl-module-p</a>.</p>
