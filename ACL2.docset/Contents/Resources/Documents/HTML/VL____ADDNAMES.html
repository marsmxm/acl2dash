<p>Name any unnamed gate instances, block statements, generates, etc.</p><p>Note: We used to name everything fairly arbitrarily, as 
unnamed_elemtype_nnn, where "nnn" was a globally-unique number.  But this 
turns out to be too fragile -- a localized design change can nonlocally affect 
the numbering everywhere.  We ran into this when specifying signals for a 
decomposition; those signals happened to be inside an unnamed generate block, 
which likely would mean we'd have to change the signal names often as the 
design changed.</p> 
 
<p>In fact, there is a System Verilog spec-mandated scheme for naming unnamed 
generate blocks, from Sec. 27.6 of the IEEE spec.  The names generated are 
"genblkN", numbered within each scope starting at 1.  Explicitly named 
generate blocks still take up an index -- the index N indicates the Nth 
generate block in the scope, not the Nth unnamed generate block.  If another 
item is named e.g. "genblk5", then leading zeros are added to the numeral 
until there's no conflict, e.g. "genblk005".</p> 
 
<p>A complication: if the name to be introduced exists in a higher scope, then 
a reference to that name in the current scope (or below) now refers to the 
genblock, not to the item from the higher scope.  E.g.:</p> 
<pre class="code">module top;
  wire genblk1;
  if (1) begin // genblk01, to avoid conflict
     if (1) begin // genblk1
        wire b;
     end
     wire a = genblk1; // !!
  end
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Implementations are split on what happens here.  NCVerilog allows the 
reference to genblk1 to refer to the wire, while still naming the inner scope 
genblk1 (in, e.g., VCD dumps).  So evidently the generate block is named 
genblk1, but is not found when looking up module item genblk1.  (This is OK 
because you're not allowed to use hierarchical references through unnamed 
generate blocks.)  VCS complains about the reference to genblk1, nonsensically 
saying it hasn't been declared yet.  Perhaps what it really means is that it 
interprets the reference as a reference to the generate block, which isn't 
allowed, and the error message just is making some invalid assumption about 
what went wrong.  When the reference is removed, a VCD dump also indicates that 
the inner block is called genblk1.</p> 
 
<p>Summary: Both implementations agree that the inner block is called genblk1, 
but they don't agree on whether a reference to wire genblk1 is disturbed by its 
presence; ncv thinks it isn't, vcs thinks it is.</p> 
 
<p>The situation changes again if there is a hierarchical reference through a 
scope named genblk1:</p> 
<pre class="code">module sub;
  wire [3:0] foo = 2;
endmodule
module top;
 sub genblk1 ();
 if (1) begin // genblk01
   if (1) begin // genblk1
     wire [3:0] foo = 1;
   end
   wire [3:0] fooref = genblk1.foo + 8;
 end
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Here ncv complains that implicit names aren't allowed in hierarchical names, 
whereas VCS happily runs, with the value of fooref ending up as 9, indicating 
that it took genblk1 as referring to the generate block, not the module 
instance.</p> 
 
<p>So for now, because it's simple, we'll go with VCS's behavior: unnamed 
generate blocks become full named members of the hierarchy that can be looked 
up by name.</p> 
 
<p>The situation is tricky with elements other than generate blocks, because 
implementations aren't supposed to give them names.  However, the other 
elements we plan to name are ports, module and gate instances, and block 
statements.  Ports and block statements aren't referenceable by HIDs, so they 
won't interfere with any lookups.  Module and gate instances might, though. 
BOZO Our solution for now is just to assume that we've chosen obscure enough 
generated instance names that there won't be any conflicts.</p>
