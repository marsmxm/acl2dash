<p>About Types</p><p>The universe of ACL2 objects includes objects of many different 
 types.  For example, <span class="v">t</span> is a ``symbol'' and 3 is an ``integer.''  Roughly 
 speaking the objects of ACL2 can be partitioned into the following types:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____Numbers_02in_02ACL2.html">Numbers</a> such as <span class="v">3, -22/7,
 #c(3 5/2)</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____ACL2_02Characters.html">Characters</a> such as <span class="v">#\A,
 #\a, #\Space</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____ACL2_02Strings.html">Strings</a> such as <span class="v">"This is a
 string."</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____ACL2_02Symbols.html">Symbols</a> such as <span class="v">'abc,
 'smith::abc</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____ACL2_02Conses_02or_02Ordered_02Pairs.html">Conses (or 
 Ordered Pairs)</a> such as <span class="v">'((a . 1) (b . 2))</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>When proving theorems it is important to know the types of object returned 
 by a term.  ACL2 uses a complicated heuristic algorithm, called <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>, to determine what types of objects a term may 
 produce.  The user can more or less program the <span class="v">type-set</span> algorithm by 
 proving <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 rules.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 is an ``untyped'' logic in the sense that the syntax is not typed: It 
 is legal to apply a function symbol of n arguments to any n terms, regardless 
 of the types of the argument terms.  Thus, it is permitted to write such odd 
 expressions as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> t 3)</span> which sums the symbol <span class="v">t</span> and the integer 3. 
 Common Lisp does not prohibit such expressions.  We like untyped languages 
 because they are simple to describe, though proving theorems about them can be 
 awkward because, unless one is careful in the way one defines or states 
 things, unusual cases (like <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> t 3)</span>) can arise.</p> 
 
 <p>To make theorem proving easier in ACL2, the axioms actually define a value 
 for such terms.  The value of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> t 3)</span> is 3; under the ACL2 axioms, 
 non-numeric arguments to <span class="v">+</span> are treated as though they were 0.</p> 
 
 <p>You might immediately wonder about our claim that ACL2 is Common Lisp, 
 since <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> t 3)</span> is ``an error'' (and will sometimes even ``signal an 
 error'') in Common Lisp.  It is to handle this problem that ACL2 has 
 <b>guards</b>.  We will discuss guards later in the Walking Tour.  However, 
 many new users simply ignore the issue of guards entirely and that is what we 
 recommend for now.</p>
