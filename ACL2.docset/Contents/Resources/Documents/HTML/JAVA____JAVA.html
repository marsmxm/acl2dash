<p>An ACL2 library for Java.</p><p>Currently this library contains:</p><ul>
<li>A deep embedding of ACL2 in Java.</li>
<li>A Java code generator for ACL2.</li>
<li>A formalization in ACL2 of some aspects of the Java language.</li>
</ul><p>It is expected that this library will be extended with more 
     Java-related formalizations and tools.</p><p>This library is based on the following sources:</p><ul>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html" target="_blank"><nobr>Java language specification<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se14/html"></nobr></a>, referenced as `[JLS]' in the documentation of this library. 
      Chapters and sections are referenced 
      by appending their designations separated by colon, 
      e.g. 
      `[JLS:4.2]' references Section 4.2 of [JLS].</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se14/html" target="_blank"><nobr>Java Virtual Machine specification<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se14/html"></nobr></a>, referenced as `[JVMS]' in the documentation of this library. 
      Chapters and sections are referenced 
      by appending their designations separated by colon, 
      e.g. 
      `[JVMS:5.5]' references Section 5.5 of [JVMS].</li>
<li>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api" target="_blank"><nobr>Java API specification<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/api"></nobr></a>, referenced as `[JAPIS]' in the documentation of this library.</li>
</ul><p>These square-bracketed references may be used
