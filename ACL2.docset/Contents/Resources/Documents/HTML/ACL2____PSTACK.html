<p>Seeing what the prover is up to</p><pre class="code">General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a>)      ; inspect break
(<a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a> t)    ; inspect break, printing all calls in abbreviated form
(<a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a> :all) ; as above, but only abbreviating the ACL2 world</pre> 
 
 <p>When the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a>)</span> is executed during a break from a proof, or at 
 the end of a proof that the user has aborted, a ``process stack'' (or ``prover 
 stack'') will be printed that gives some idea of what the theorem prover has 
 been doing.  Moreover, by evaluating <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERBOSE-PSTACK.html">verbose-pstack</a> t)</span> before starting a 
 proof (see <a href="ACL2____VERBOSE-PSTACK.html">verbose-pstack</a>) one can get trace-like information about 
 prover functions, including time summaries, printed to the screen during a 
 proof.  This feature is currently quite raw and may be refined considerably as 
 time goes on, based on user suggestions.  For example, the usual control of 
 printing given by <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a> is irrelevant for printing the 
 pstack.</p> 
 
 <p>The use of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a> t)</span> or <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a> :all)</span> should only be used by 
 those who are comfortable looking at functions in the ACL2 source code. 
 Otherwise, simply use <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a>)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Entries in the pstack include the following (listed here alphabetically, 
 except for the first).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">preprocess-clause</span>, <span class="v">simplify-clause</span>, etc. (in 
 general,<span class="v">xxx-clause</span>): top-level processes in the prover ``waterfall''</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">clausify</span>: splitting a goal into subgoals</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">ev-fncall</span>: evaluating a function on explicit arguments</p>
