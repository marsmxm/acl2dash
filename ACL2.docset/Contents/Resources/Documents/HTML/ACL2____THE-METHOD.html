<p>How to find proofs</p><p>Also see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> for a more 
 detailed tutorial on how to prove theorems with ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>Many users develop proof scripts in an Emacs buffer and submit one event at 
 a time to the theorem prover running in a <span class="v">*shell*</span> buffer.  The script 
 buffer is logically divided into two regions: the events that have been 
 accepted by the theorem prover and those that have not yet been accepted.  An 
 imaginary ``barrier'' divides these two regions.  The region above the barrier 
 describes the state of the <span class="v">*shell*</span> buffer (and ACL2's logical world). 
 The region below the barrier is the ``to do'' list.</p> 
 
 <p>We usually start a proof project by typing the key lemmas, and main goal 
 into the to do list.  Definitions are here just regarded as theorems to prove 
 (i.e., the measure conjectures).  Then we follow ``The Method.''</p> 
 
 <p>(1) Think about the proof of the first theorem in the to do list. 
 Structure the proof either as an induction followed by simplification or just 
 simplification.  Have the necessary lemmas been proved? That is, are the 
 necessary lemmas in the done list already?  If so, proceed to Step 2. 
 Otherwise, add the necessary lemmas at the front of the to do list and repeat 
 Step 1.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) Call the theorem prover on the first theorem in the to do list and let 
 the output stream into the *shell* buffer.  Abort the proof if it runs more 
 than a few seconds.</p> 
 
 <p>(3) If the theorem prover succeeded, advance the barrier past the 
 successful command and go to Step 1.</p> 
 
 <p>(4) Otherwise, inspect the failed proof attempt, starting from the 
 beginning, not the end.  Basically you should look for the first place the 
 proof attempt deviates from your imagined proof.  If your imagined proof was 
 inductive, inspect the induction scheme used by ACL2.  If that is ok, then 
 find the first subsequent subgoal that is stable under simplification and 
 think about why it was not proved by the simplifier.  If your imagined proof 
 was not inductive, then think about the first subgoal stable under 
 simplification, as above.  Modify the script appropriately.  It usually means 
 adding lemmas to the to do list, just in front of the theorem just tried.  It 
 could mean adding hints to the current theorem.  In any case, after the 
 modifications go to Step 1.</p> 
 
 <p>We do not seriously suggest that this or any rotely applied algorithm will 
 let you drive ACL2 to difficult proofs.  Indeed, to remind you of this we call 
 this ``The Method'' rather than ``the method.''  That is, we are aware of the 
 somewhat pretentious nature of any such advice.  But these remarks have helped 
 many users approach ACL2 in a constructive and disciplined way.</p> 
 
 <p>We say much more about The Method in the ACL2 book.  See the home page. 
 Also see <a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> for a discussion of a way for ACL2 to help you to 
 use The Method.  And again, see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> for 
 a more detailed tutorial.</p> 
 
 <p>Learning to read failed proofs is a useful skill.  There are several kinds 
 of ``checkpoints'' in a proof: (1) a formula to which induction is being (or 
 would be) applied, (2) the first formula stable under simplification, (3) a 
 formula that is possibly generalized, either by cross-fertilizing with and 
 throwing away an equivalence hypothesis or by explicit generalization of a 
 term with a new variable.</p> 
 
 <p>At the induction checkpoint, confirm that you believe the formula being 
 proved is a theorem and that it is appropriately strong for an inductive 
 proof.  Read the selected induction scheme and make sure it agrees with your 
 idea of how the proof should go.</p> 
 
 <p>At the post-simplification checkpoint, which is probably the most commonly 
 seen, consider whether there are additional rewrite rules you could prove to 
 make the formula simplify still further.  Look for compositions of function 
 symbols you could rewrite.  Look for contradictions among hypotheses and prove 
 the appropriate implications: for example, the checkpoint might contain the 
 two hypotheses <span class="v">(P (F A))</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="ACL2____Q.html">Q</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">G</a> (F A))))</span> and you might 
 realize that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p x) (<a href="ACL2____Q.html">q</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x)))</span> is a theorem.  Look for signs that 
 your existing rules did not apply, e.g., for terms that should have been 
 rewritten, and figure out why they were not.  Possible causes include that 
 they do not exactly match your old rules, that your old rules have hypotheses 
 that cannot be relieved here — perhaps because some other rules are 
 missing, or perhaps your old rules are disabled.  If you cannot find any 
 further simplifications to make in the formula, ask yourself whether it is 
 valid.  If so, sketch a proof.  Perhaps the proof is by appeal to a 
 combination of lemmas you should now prove?</p> 
 
 <p>At the two generalization checkpoints — where hypotheses are 
 discarded or terms are replaced by variables — ask yourself whether the 
 result is a theorem.  It often is not.  Think about rewrite rules that would 
 prove the formula.  These are often restricted versions of the overly-general 
 formulas created by the system's heuristics.</p>
