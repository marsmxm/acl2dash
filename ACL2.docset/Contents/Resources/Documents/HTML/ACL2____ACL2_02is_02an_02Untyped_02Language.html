<p>ACL2 is an Untyped Language</p><p>The example</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;<b>(app '(a b c) 27)</b> 
(A B C . 27) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>illustrates the fact that ACL2's logic is untyped (click <a href="ACL2____About_02Types.html">here</a> for a brief discussion of the typed versus untyped 
 nature of the logic).</p> 
 
 <p>The definition of <span class="v">app</span> makes no restriction of the arguments to lists. 
 The definition says that if the first argument satisfies <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 then return the second argument.  In this example, when <span class="v">app</span> has recursed 
 three times down the <span class="v">cdr</span> of its first argument, <span class="v">'(a b c)</span>, it reaches 
 the final <span class="v">nil</span>, which satisfies <span class="v">endp</span>, and so 27 is returned.  It is 
 naturally consed into the emerging list as the function returns from 
 successive recursive calls (since <span class="v">cons</span> does not require its arguments to 
 be lists, either).  The result is an ``improper'' list, <span class="v">(a b c . 27)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>You can think of <span class="v">(app x y)</span> as building a binary tree by replacing the 
 right-most tip of the tree <span class="v">x</span> with the tree <span class="v">y</span>.</p>
