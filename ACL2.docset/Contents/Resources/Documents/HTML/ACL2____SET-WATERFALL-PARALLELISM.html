<p>For ACL2(p): configuring the parallel execution of the waterfall</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic relates to the experimental 
 extension of ACL2 supporting parallel execution and proof; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.</p>

 <p><span class="v">Set-waterfall-parallelism</span> evaluates its argument, which specifies the 
 enabling or disabling of the <a href="ACL2____PARALLEL.html">parallel</a> execution of ACL2's main proof 
 process, the waterfall.</p> 
 
 <p>It also sets <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global <span class="v">waterfall-printing</span> to an appropriate 
 value.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PRINTING.html">set-waterfall-printing</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that not all ACL2 features are supported when waterfall-parallelism is 
 set to non-<span class="v">nil</span> (see <a href="ACL2____UNSUPPORTED-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM-FEATURES.html">unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">t</span> is treated the same as a value of <span class="v">:resource-based</span> 
 and is provided for user convenience.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Resource-based</span> waterfall parallelism typically achieves the best 
 performance in ACL2(p), while maintaining system stability, so 
 <span class="v">:resource-based</span> (or equivalently, <span class="v">t</span>) is the recommended value.</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">nil</span> indicates that ACL2(p) should never prove subgoals in 
 parallel.</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">:full</span> indicates that ACL2(p) should always prove 
 independent subgoals in parallel.</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">:top-level</span> indicates that ACL2(p) should prove each of the 
 top-level subgoals in parallel but otherwise prove subgoals in a serial 
 manner.  This mode is useful when the user knows that there are enough 
 top-level subgoals, many of which take a non-trivial amount of time to be 
 proved, such that proving them in parallel will result in a useful reduction 
 in overall proof time.</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">:resource-based</span> (or equivalently, <span class="v">t</span>) indicates that 
 ACL2(p) should use its built-in heuristics to determine whether CPU core 
 resources are available for parallel execution.  Note that ACL2(p) does not 
 hook into the operating system to determine the workload on the machine. 
 ACL2(p) works off the assumption that it is the only process using significant 
 CPU resources, and it optimizes the amount of parallelism based on the number 
 of CPU cores in the system.  (Note that ACL2(p) knows how to obtain the number 
 of CPU cores from the operating system in CCL, but that, in SBCL and in 
 Lispworks, a constant is used instead).</p> 
 
 <p>During the first proof attempt of a given conjecture, a value of 
 <span class="v">:resource-and-timing-based</span> results in the same behavior as with 
 <span class="v">:resource-based</span>.  However, on subsequent proof attempts, the time it took 
 to prove each subgoal will be considered when deciding whether to parallelize 
 execution.  If a particular theorem's proof is already achieving satisfactory 
 speedup via <span class="v">:resource-based</span> parallelism, there is no reason to try this 
 setting.  However, if the user wishes to experiment, the 
 <span class="v">:resource-and-timing-based</span> setting may improve performance.  Note that 
 since the initial run does not have the subgoal proof times available, this 
 mode will never be better than the <span class="v">:resource-based</span> setting for 
 non-interactive theorem proving.</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">:pseudo-parallel</span> results in using the parallel waterfall 
 code, but with serial execution.  This setting is useful for debugging the 
 code base that supports parallel execution of the waterfall.  For example, you 
 may wish to use this mode if you are an ``ACL2 Hacker'' who would like to see 
 comprehensible output from tracing (see <a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a>) the <span class="v">@par</span> versions 
 of the waterfall functions.</p> 
 
 <p>Since <a href="ACL2____MEMOIZATION.html">memoization</a> is not supported when waterfall parallelism is 
 enabled (see <a href="ACL2____UNSUPPORTED-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM-FEATURES.html">unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features</a>), then when 
 <span class="v">set-waterfall-parallelism</span> is called with a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value, all 
 memoized functions are unmemoized.  When <span class="v">set-waterfall-parallelism</span> is 
 again called with a <span class="v">nil</span> value, those memoization settings are 
 restored.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Set-waterfall-parallelism</span> is an embedded event form.  However, a call 
 of this macro will not affect waterfall-parallelism when including a certified 
 book that contains that call.  For such an effect, you may use the following 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> form; also see <a href="ACL2____NON-PARALLEL-BOOK.html">non-parallel-book</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> (<a href="ACL2____ER-PROGN.html">er-progn</a> (<a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a> :full)
