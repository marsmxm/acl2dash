<p>A formalization of the Yul language in ACL2.</p><p>This formalization covers a generic for of Yul 
     that supports the types of the EVM dialect. 
     The formalization consists of 
     a concrete syntax, 
     an abstract syntax, 
     a static semantics, and 
     a dynamic semantics. 
     We plan to make this formalization more generic, 
     and in particular to also support types in othe Yul dialects.</p>
