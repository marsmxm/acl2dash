<p>We restore not only <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> calls 
     returned by multi-result functions, 
     but also <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> calls that may happen in an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> 
     in a function that may or may not return multiple results.</p><p>At the top level, 
     this code is called on the body of a function 
     that must be translated to Java. 
     In this top-level call, 
     we pass as second argument the number of result of the function, 
     which is known: see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-RESTORE-MV-CALLS-IN-BODY.html">atj-restore-mv-calls-in-body</a></span>. 
     As we descend into the term, this number may change. 
     When we try to restore <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> calls in a term, 
     we always know the number of results that the term should return, 
     as the <span class="v">numres</span> parameter.</p><p>When we encounter a variable, 
     we must be expecting one result, 
     and in that case we leave the variable unchanged. 
     This would not be true for the <span class="v">mv</span> variable 
     that results from a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> 
     (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CHECK-MV-LET-CALL.html">check-mv-let-call</a></span>), 
     but as explained below we process translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>s specially: 
     when we reach a variable, it is never that <span class="v">mv</span> variable, 
     and so it is always single-valued.</p><p>When we encounter a quoted constant, 
     we must be expecting one result, 
     and in that case we leave the quoted constant unchanged.</p><p>Before processing a call, 
     we use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CHECK-MV-LET-CALL.html">check-mv-let-call</a></span> to see if 
     the term may be a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>. 
     If the term has that form, it is possible, but unlikely, 
     that it is not actually a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>. 
     In order to properly restore <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> calls in the <span class="v">mv-term</span>, 
     we need to determine how many results it is expected to return. 
     Because of the pre-translation step that removes unused variables, 
     this cannot be determined, in general, from the term, 
     because some <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span> calls may have been removed. 
     Even if they were all present, it is still possible (though unlikely) 
     that the term does not involve multiple values, 
     and that it just looks like a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>. 
     Thus, we use the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERM-POSSIBLE-NUMBERS-OF-RESULTS.html">term-possible-numbers-of-results</a></span> utility 
     to calculate the number of results of the <span class="v">mv-term</span>. 
     Recall that this may return two possibilities, 
     namely 1 and a number greater than 1: 
     in this case, we pick the number greater than 1 
     (but it would be also correct to pick 1). 
     If instead there is just one possibility, then we obviously use that. 
     This value is used as <span class="v">numres</span> to recursively process the <span class="v">mv-term</span>, 
     which in general may restore not only <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> calls 
     at the top level of that term, but also in subterms. 
     We also recursively process the <span class="v">body-term</span>, 
     this time with the same <span class="v">numres</span> as for the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> term.</p><p>If the term does not have the form of a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, 
     we check whether it is a translated <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a></span>, 
     i.e. a nest of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span>es ending with a quoted <span class="v">nil</span>. 
     If the expected number of results is 1, we leave this term as is, 
     i.e. as a single list. 
     Otherwise, we replace the term with an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> call.</p><p>If the term does not have any of the previous forms, 
     we check whether it is a call of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>. 
     In that case, we recursively process the arguments: 
     the test must be single-valued, 
     while the branches have the same <span class="v">numres</span> as the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> call.</p><p>We check for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> for robustness, 
     but those have been all removed by a previous pre-translation step.</p><p>We treat all other calls as follows. 
     We recursively process the arguments, 
     each of which must return a single value. 
     If the function is a lambda expression, 
     we recursively process its body, 
     with the same <span class="v">numres</span> as the lambda call.</p>
