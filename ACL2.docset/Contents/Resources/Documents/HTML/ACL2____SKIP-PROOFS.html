<p>Skip proofs for a given form â€” a quick way to introduce unsoundness</p><pre class="code">Example Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a>
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> x) nil (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))))))

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a> form)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">form</span> is processed as usual except that the proof obligations 
 usually generated are merely assumed.</p> 
 
 <p>Normally <span class="v">form</span> is an event; see <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  If you want to put 
 <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> around more than one event, consider the following (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a>): <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a> event1 event2 ... eventk))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>WARNING</b>: The use of <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> carries an implicit promise by 
 the user that the ensuing proof obligations are indeed theorems of the current 
 theory.  When that is not the case, <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> can even allow 
 inconsistent <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> to be admitted to the logic.  Use it at your own 
 risk!  If your intention is truly to extend the current logical theory, 
 consider using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> instead.</p> 
 
 <p>Sometimes in the development of a formal model or proof it is convenient to 
 skip the proofs required by a given event.  By embedding the event in a 
 <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> form, you can avoid the proof burdens generated by the event, 
 at the risk of introducing unsoundness.  Below we list four illustrative 
 situations in which you might find <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> useful.</p> 
 
 <p>1. The termination argument for a proposed function definition is 
 complicated.  You presume you could admit it, but are not sure that your 
 definition has the desired properties.  By embedding the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> event 
 in a <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> you can ``admit'' the function and experiment with 
 theorems about it before undoing (see <a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a>) and then paying the price of 
 its admission.  Note however that you might still have to supply a measure. 
 The set of formals used in some valid measure, known as the ``measured 
 subset'' of the set of formals, is used by ACL2's induction heuristics and 
 therefore needs to be suitably specified.  You may wish to specify the special 
 measure of <span class="v">(:? v1 ... vk)</span>, where <span class="v">(v1 ... vk)</span> enumerates the measured 
 subset.</p> 
 
 <p>2. You intend eventually to verify the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s for a definition but 
 do not want to take the time now to pursue that.  By embedding the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> event in a <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> you can get the system to behave as 
 though the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s were verified.</p> 
 
 <p>3. You are repeatedly recertifying a book while making many experimental 
 changes.  A certain <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> in the book takes a very long time to prove 
 and you believe the proof is not affected by the changes you are making.  By 
 embedding the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event in a <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> you allow the theorem 
 to be assumed without proof during the experimental recertifications.</p> 
 
 <p>4. You are constructing a proof top-down and wish to defer the proof of a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> until you are convinced of its utility.  You can embed the 
 <span class="v">defthm</span> in a <span class="v">skip-proofs</span>.  Of course, you may find later (when you 
 attempt prove the theorem) that the proposed <span class="v">defthm</span> is not a theorem.</p> 
 
 <p>Unsoundness or Lisp errors may result if the presumptions underlying a use 
 of <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> are incorrect.  Therefore, <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> must be 
 considered a dangerous (though useful) tool in system development.</p> 
 
 <p>Roughly speaking, a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> embedded in a <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> is 
 essentially a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>, except that it is not noted as an axiom for 
 the purposes of functional instantiation (see <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>).  But a 
 skipped <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> is much more subtle since not only is the definitional 
 equation being assumed but so are formulas relating to termination and type. 
 The situation is also difficult to characterize if the <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> are within the scope of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> in which constrained 
 functions are being introduced.  In such contexts no clear logical story is 
 maintained; in particular, constraints aren't properly tracked for 
 definitions.  A proof script involving <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> should be regarded as 
 work-in-progress, not as a completed proof with some unproved assumptions.  A 
 <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> event represents a promise by the author to admit the given 
 event without further axioms.  In other words, <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> should only be 
 used when the belief is that the proof obligations are indeed theorems in the 
 existing ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 allows the certification of <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> containing <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> 
 <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> by providing the keyword argument <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp t</span> to the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> command.  This is contrary to the spirit of certified 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>, since one is supposedly assured by a valid <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> 
 that a book has been ``blessed.''  But certification, too, takes the view of 
 <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> as ``work-in-progress'' and so allows the author of the book 
 to promise to finish.  When such <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> are certified, a warning to the 
 author is printed, reminding him or her of the incurred obligation.  When 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> containing <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> are included into a session, a 
 warning to the user is printed, reminding the user that the book is in fact 
 incomplete and possibly inconsistent.  This warning is in fact an error if 
 <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form; see <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude with a technical note.  <span class="v">Skip-proofs</span> works by binding the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> special <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> to <span class="v">t</span> unless it is already 
 bound to a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value; see <a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a>.</p>
