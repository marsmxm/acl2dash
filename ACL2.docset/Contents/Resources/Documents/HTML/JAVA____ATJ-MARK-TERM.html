<p>Marking a variable as `new' is always ``safe'', 
     because it is always safe to introduce a new Java local variable. 
     On the other hand, marking a variable as `old' requires care, 
     to prevent a Java local variable to be erroneously reused. 
     To understand this marking algorithm, 
     one has to keep in mind how ACL2 terms are translated to Java: 
     see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-GEN-SHALLOW-TERM.html">atj-gen-shallow-term</a></span> and companions. 
     This is a delicate algorithm: 
     a proof of correctness would be very beneficial.</p><p>Two conditions are necessary for reusing a variable: 
     (i) the variable must be in scope (i.e. exist and be accessible); and 
     (ii) the previous value of the variable must not be used afterwards. 
     The parameters <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> and <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> 
     support the checking of these conditions.</p><p>The parameter <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> consists of the variables in scope 
     at the point where the term under consideration occurs. 
     At the top level (see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-MARK-FORMALS_B2BODY.html">atj-mark-formals+body</a></span>), 
     it is intialized with the (unmarked) formal parameters 
     of the ACL2 function whose formal parameters and body are being marked: 
     indeed, the formal parameters of a function are in scope for the body. 
     As we descend into subterms, when we encounter a lambda expression, 
     we extend <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> with its (unmarked) formal parameters; 
     only the ones that are marked as `new' actually extend the scope, 
     while the ones marked as `old' were already in <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span>. 
     The generated Java code evaluates functions' actual arguments 
     left-to-right: 
     thus, local variables introduced (for lambda expressions in) an argument 
     are generally (see exception shortly) in scope for successive arguments. 
     Therefore, <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> is threaded through the marking functions 
     (i.e. passed as argument and returned, possibly updated, as result). 
     When processing a lambda expression applied to arguments, 
     <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> is threaded first through the arguments, 
     and then through the body (which is evaluated after the arguments), 
     after augmenting it with the formal parameters. 
     The exception mentioned above is for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>, 
     which is turned into a Java <span class="v">if</span> 
     whose branches are Java blocks: 
     Java variables declared inside these blocks 
     have a more limited scope (namely, the respective block), 
     and therefore should not be added to the <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> 
     that is passed to mark terms after the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>. 
     The variables introduced in the test of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> 
     are declared outside the branches' blocks, 
     and so they are threaded through. 
     The <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> resulting from marking the test of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> 
     is passed to mark both branches, 
     but their returned <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> is ignored. 
     The code for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> is a bit more complicated 
     because of the special treatment of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> a a b)</span> terms, 
     which are treated as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> a b)</span>: 
     the Java code generated for this case is a little different 
     (see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-GEN-SHALLOW-OR-CALL.html">atj-gen-shallow-or-call</a></span>), 
     but the treatment of <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> 
     is essentially the same as just explained 
     (there is no `then' branch to mark, because it is the same as the test, 
     which has already been marked).</p><p>The parameter <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> consists of the variables 
     whose current values are used ``after'' the term under consideration. 
     At the top level (see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-MARK-FORMALS_B2BODY.html">atj-mark-formals+body</a></span>), 
     this is initialized with <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     because no variables are used after evaluating the body of the function. 
     As we descend into subterms, 
     <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> is extended as needed, 
     based on the ``neighboring'' subterms 
     that will be evaluated (in the generated Java code) 
     after the subterm under consideration. 
     In particular, when marking an actual argument of a function call, 
     <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> is extended with all the free variables 
     of the actual arguments of the same function call 
     that occur after the one being marked; 
     recall that arguments are evaluated left-to-right 
     in the generated Java code. 
     The function <span class="v">atj-mark-terms</span>, 
     which is used to mark the actual arguments of a function call, 
     augments <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> with the free variables 
     in the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> of the current list of arguments; 
     this is somewhat inefficient, 
     as the same free variables are collected repeatedly 
     as the argument terms are processed, 
     but terms are not expected to be too large in the near future; 
     this may be eventually optimized when needed. 
     Furthermore, as we traverse the arguments of a function call, 
     we augment the used variables with the ones that will occur 
     in the Java expressions generated for the preceding arguments; 
     see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-VARS-IN-JEXPR.html">atj-vars-in-jexpr</a></span>.</p><p>Calls of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> are treated a little differently, 
     because the arguments are not evaluated left-to-right 
     in the generated Java code: 
     when marking the test, we augment <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> 
     with all the free variables in the branches; 
     when marking either branch, we use the same <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> 
     that was passed for the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>, 
     because the two branches are independent. 
     The <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a></span> form of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> is treated slightly differently as usual, 
     but the essence is the same. 
     Unlike <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span>, <span class="v">var-used-after</span> is not threaded through; 
     it is simply passed down, and augmented as needed.</p><p>The body of a lambda expression is evaluated after its actual arguments: 
     thus, when marking the actual arguments of a lambda expression 
     we must augment <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> 
     with the free variables of the lambda expression, 
     i.e. the free variables in the body minus the formal parameters.</p><p>As we mark the formal parameters of a lambda expression, 
     we need to mark in the same way 
     all the references to these variables in the body of the lambda expression. 
     For this purpose, we pass around a mapping, <span class="v">vars-to-mark-new</span>, 
     from (unmarked) variables to markings: 
     this could be an alist from symbols to booleans, 
     but we isomorphically use lists (treated as sets) of symbols instead, 
     which are the variable marked as `new', 
     while the variables not in the list are marked as `old'. 
     When the term to be marked is a variable, 
     we look it up in this list, and mark it accordingly.</p><p>When the term to be marked is a quoted constant, 
     it is obviously left unchanged.</p><p>When the term to be marked is a function call, 
     we first treat the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> (and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a></span>) case separately. 
     We mark the test, and after that the two branches. 
     The handling of <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> and <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> for this case 
     has been explained above.</p><p>For all other function calls, which are strict, 
     we first mark the actual arguments, 
     treating <span class="v">vars-in-scope</span> and <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> 
     as explained above. 
     For calls of named functions, we are done at this point: 
     we put the named function in front of the marked arguments and return. 
     For calls of lambda expression, 
     we use the auxiliary function <span class="v">atj-mark-lambda-formals</span> 
     to decide which formal parameters should be marked as `new' or `old'. 
     We mark the parameter as `old' (indicating that the variable can be reused) 
     iff the following three conditions hold. 
     The first condition is that the variable must be in scope; 
     note that variables have already been annotated with types at this point, 
     and so by testing variable names we also test their types, 
     which is needed for Java 
     (i.e. we could not reuse a Java variable of type <span class="v">Acl2Symbol</span> 
     to store a value of type <span class="v">Acl2String</span>). 
     The second condition is that the variable is not used 
     after the lambda call term, i.e. it is not in <span class="v">vars-used-after</span>: 
     otherwise, we would overwrite something that was supposed to be used later, 
     with incorrect results in general. 
     The third condition is that the variable is not free 
     in any of the actual arguments that correspond to 
     the formal parameters of the lambda expression 
     that come just after the one being marked: 
     this is because, in the generated Java code, 
     the lambda variables are assigned one after the other, 
     and therefore we should not overwrite a variable 
     that may be needed afterwards. 
     For instance, consider a swap <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((x y) (y x)) ...)</span>: 
     <span class="v">x</span> cannot be reused 
     (even if it is in scope and not used after the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>) 
     because it must be assigned to <span class="v">y</span> after <span class="v">y</span> is assigned to <span class="v">x</span> 
     (Java does not support parallel assignment); 
     on the other hand, <span class="v">y</span> could be reused, 
     if it is in scope and not used after the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>, 
     because at the time of assigning to <span class="v">y</span> 
     its (previous) value has already been assigned to <span class="v">x</span>.</p><p>When analyzing the arguments of a call of a lambda expression, 
     we need to extend <span class="v">vars-used-after</span> with 
     the free variables in the lambda expression 
     (i.e. the free variables in the body minus the formal arguments). 
     This is because the body of the lambda expression 
     is evaluated after the arguments of the call. 
     We store the extended list into <span class="v">vars-used-after-args</span>. 
     But when we process the body of the lambda expression after that, 
     we go back to using <span class="v">vars-used-after</span>, 
     which excludes the variables used in the lambda expression, 
     and only includes the variables used 
     after the call of the lambda expression.</p>
