<p>Substitution into Verilog constructs</p><p>We implement routines to substitute values for identifiers 
throughout Verilog constructs such as expressions, assignments, and 
modules.</p> 
 
<p>Our original use of substitution was in unparameterization, where we used 
substitution to replace parameters with their values throughout a module. 
Because of this, and since there are usually only a couple of parameters per 
module, we historically created ordinary alists and look up with <a href="ACL2____HONS-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">hons-assoc-equal</a> rather than <a href="ACL2____HONS-GET.html">hons-get</a>.  Since then we have found 
substitution to be more generally useful, and prefer to use fast alists.</p>
