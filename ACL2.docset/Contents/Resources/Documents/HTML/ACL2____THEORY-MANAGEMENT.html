<p>Recommendations related to enabling and disabling functions and 
theorems.</p><p>The best practices depend somewhat on the kind of book you are 
writing.  We distinguish between <i>Widget Libraries</i> and <i>Core 
Libraries</i>.</p> 
 
<h3>Widget Libraries</h3> 
 
<p>Scenario: your library describes a particular kind of "Widget:" it defines 
what Widgets are, provides some useful algorithms for operating on Widgets, and 
proves some theorems about the properties of Widgets and these algorithms.</p> 
 
<h4>Recommendations</h4> 
 
<ol> 
 
<li>Avoid any non-local inclusion of arithmetic libraries</li> 
 
<li>Avoid any non-local <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> ...)</span> events that involve built-in ACL2 
functions.  For instance, do not do: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> append))</span>.</li> 
 
<li>Try to respect the ACL2 namespace, e.g., do not define new functions in the 
ACL2 package, especially with short or generic names, etc.</li> 
 
</ol> 
 
<h4>Rationale</h4> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>You would expect that loading a Widget library should generally just give 
you definitions and lemmas that are about Widgets.</li> 
 
<li>You would not expect a Widget library to change how you reason about other 
concepts that are unrelated to Widgets.</li> 
 
<li>Non-local arithmetic includes may make your Widget library incompatible 
with other arithmetic libraries.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h3>Core Libraries</h3> 
 
<p>Scenario: your library is meant to assist with reasoning about built-in ACL2 
functions, for instance:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>arithmetic functions like +, -, *, /, floor, mod, logand;</li> 
<li>list functions like append, len, nth, member, subsetp;</li> 
<li>string functions like coerce, concatenate, subseq;</li> 
<li>system functions like io routines and state updates;</li> 
<li>meta functions like pseudo-termp, disjoin, conjoin-clauses;</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Since your library is inherently about existing ACL2 functions rather than 
new definitions, the Widget-library recommendations do not necessarily 
apply.</p>
