<p>Run some events only if an environment variable is defined and nonempty, 
          with build system support.</p><p>Ifdef and <a href="ACL2____IFNDEF.html">ifndef</a>, defined in "books/build/ifdef.lisp", 
support conditionally running some events depending on the build environment. 
This works as follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IFDEF.html">ifdef</a> "MY_ENV_VAR"
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) x)
   (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "bar")
   :endif)</pre> 
<p>produces the given defun and include-book events only if "MY_ENV_VAR" is 
defined in the environment and is not the empty string.  <a href="ACL2____IFNDEF.html">Ifndef</a> has the 
opposite behavior.</p> 
 
<p>There is special support in the <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> build system for these 
constructs, so that if the environment in which the cert.pl scan is run matches 
the environment in which the ACL2 job is run, the build system will know the 
true dependencies of the file, taking ifdefs into account.</p> 
 
<p>For this to work correctly, it is important to write the ifdef forms in a 
standard manner, as shown above: the <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IFDEF.html">ifdef</a> "VARNAME"</span> must be on a 
single line with nothing preceding it, and the <span class="v">:endif)</span> should be on a line 
without any other dependency-relevant items.  E.g., the following will not work 
as expected:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IFDEF.html">ifdef</a> "USE_FOO" (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "foo") :endif)</pre>
