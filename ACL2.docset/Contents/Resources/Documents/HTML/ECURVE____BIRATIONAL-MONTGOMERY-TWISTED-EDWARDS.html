<p>Birational equivalence between 
          Montgomery curves and twisted Edwards curves.</p><p>There is a birational equivalence between <a href="ECURVE____MONTGOMERY.html">Montgomery curves</a> and <a href="ECURVE____TWISTED-EDWARDS.html">twisted Edwards curves</a>, described in Section 3 of <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/013.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>Bernstein, Birkner, Joye, Lange, and Peters's ``Twisted Edwards Curves''<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://eprint.iacr.org/2008/013.pdf"></nobr></a>. That is, there are:</p><ul>
<li>A mapping between 
      the set of Montgomery curves 
      and the set of twisted Edwards curves.</li>
<li>Given Montgomery and twisted Edwards curves related by the above mapping, 
      there is a mapping between 
      the set of points of one curve 
      and the set of points of the other curve.</li>
</ul><p>Here `birational' means that the mappings 
     between the sets of points of two corresponding curves 
     are rational functions. 
     Their denominators are 0 only for a finite number of points of the curves; 
     the complete mappings can be therefore defined 
     via the rational formulas plus a few special explicit cases.</p><p>Here we define these mappings. 
     We plan to prove properties of them at some point.</p><p>In certain cases, these birational mappings may be scaled. 
     See for instance <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1391732/birational-equvalence-of-twisted-edwards-and-montgomery-curves" target="_blank"><nobr>this page<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1391732/birational-equvalence-of-twisted-edwards-and-montgomery-curves"></nobr></a>. 
     Thus, our ACL2 functions that define the mappings 
     take an additional scaling factor as argument. 
     This can be set to 1 for the non-scaled mappings.</p>
