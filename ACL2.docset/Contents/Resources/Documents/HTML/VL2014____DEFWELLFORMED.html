<p><span class="v">Defwellformed</span> is a macro for introducing well-formedness 
checking functions.</p><h3>Motivation</h3> 
 
<p>Throughout VL, there are many functions that check to see whether some 
module element is well-formed.  When we introduce these well-formedness checks, 
we often want to have two versions of the check:</p> 
 
<ol> 
 
<li>A <b>vanilla</b> Boolean-valued predicate, <span class="v">foo-okp</span>, that causes no 
side effects and is easy to reason about, and</li> 
 
<li>A <b>debugging</b> function, <span class="v">foo-okp-warn</span> that generates useful <a href="VL2014____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> that explain precisely why the object is malformed.  In particular, 
<span class="v">foo-okp-warn</span> takes a warnings accumulator as an extra argument, and 
returns <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> okp warnings</span>').</li> 
 
</ol> 
 
<p>The value of the debugging function is probably obvious: it allows us to 
provide a better explanation for why some module is not being translated.  But 
the debugging function is <i>not</i> well-suited for reasoning.  In particular, 
in theorems we generally do not care about which warnings have been 
accumulated; we only want to know whether some structure is well-formed.  If we 
try to use the debugging function directly for this purpose, we might write 
theorems such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (foo-p x)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (foo-okp-warn x warnings)))
         (consequence x))</pre> 
 
<p>The problem with such a theorem is that <span class="v">warnings</span> is a free variable, 
which can cause problems for ACL2 when it tries to apply the rule.</p> 
 
<p>So, our approach is to introduce <b>both</b> versions of the well-formedness 
check, and then add a theorem that shows the first value returned by 
<span class="v">foo-okp-warn</span> is exactly the value returned by <span class="v">foo-okp</span>.  Accordingly, 
we can run <span class="v">foo-okp-warn</span> in our code and get useful warning messages, but 
we can always reason about the simpler function <span class="v">foo-okp</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, writing two versions of a function comes at its own cost; we 
have to duplicate the code, keep both versions in sync, and write these 
boilerplate theorems.  The macro defwellformed allows us to automate 
this process.</p> 
 
<h3>Using <span class="v">defwellformed</span>
</h3> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">defwellformed</span> macro is similar to <span class="v">defun</span>.  The general form 
is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="VL2014____DEFWELLFORMED.html">defwellformed</a> foo-okp (x other-args ...)
  :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (foop x) ...)
  :body [...]
  :extra-decls ((<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> ...))
  :parents ...
  :short ...
  :long ...)</pre> 
 
<p>Here, <span class="v">foo-okp</span> is the name of the new vanilla function, and <span class="v">(x
other-args ...)</span> are the formals.  The <span class="v">:guard</span> and <span class="v">:body</span> are used in 
the <span class="v">defun</span> form we generate, as are any <span class="v">:extra-decls</span> that you need. 
Finally, the <span class="v">parents</span>, <span class="v">short</span>, and <span class="v">long</span> fields are as in <a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The debugging function is always named by appending <span class="v">-warn</span> to the name 
of the vanilla function.  Having such a convention is necessary for our 
implementation of <span class="v">(@wf-call ...)</span>.</p> 
 
<h5>Meta-macros</h5> 
 
<p>The tricky part to using defwellformed is to write a <span class="v">:body</span> that serves 
both as the vanilla definition and as the debugging definition.  To accomplish 
this, we make use of certain "meta-macros", which can be identifier with the 
prefix <span class="v">@wf-</span>.</p> 
 
<p>In particular, the bodies of our well-formedness checks generally look 
something like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((bar ...)
      (baz ...))
  (@wf-progn
   (@wf-assert condition1 [type msg args])
   (@wf-assert condition2 [type msg args])
   (@wf-note condition type msg args)
   (@wf-call other-wf-check ...)
   ...))</pre> 
 
<p>These <span class="v">@wf-</span> expressions are only valid in the body of the 
<span class="v">defwellformed</span> command, and are given <b>different expansions</b> depending 
upon whether we are in the vanilla or debugging version of the function.</p> 
 
<p>In the vanilla function,</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>
<span class="v">(@wf-progn ...)</span> becomes <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> ...)</span>
</li> 
  <li>
<span class="v">(@wf-and ...)</span> becomes <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> ...)</span>
</li> 
  <li>
<span class="v">(@wf-assert condition ...)</span> becomes <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> condition t nil)</span>
</li> 
  <li>
<span class="v">(@wf-note condition ...)</span> becomes <span class="v">t</span>
</li> 
  <li>
<span class="v">(@wf-call other-wf-check ...)</span> becomes <span class="v">(other-wf-check ...)</span>
</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>But in the debugging function, a more complex expansion is used.</p> 
 
<dl> 
<dt>(@wf-progn ...)</dt> 
 
<dd>This becomes an appropriate <span class="v">mv-let</span> strucutre to handle the return 
values from <span class="v">@wf-assert</span> and <span class="v">@</span> commands.  Note that in the debugging 
version <b>execution continues</b> after a violation is discovered so that we 
uncover as many problems as possible.  This behavior can cause problems for 
guard verification: you cannot rely upon the earlier assertions having 
"passed" in the guards of your later assertions.  Hence the introduction of 
<span class="v">@wf-and</span>.</dd> 
 
<dt>(@wf-and ...)</dt> 
 
<dd>This becomes an <span class="v">mv-let</span> structure as in <span class="v">@wf-progn</span>, but 
<b>execution stops</b> when any assertion is violated.</dd> 
 
<dt>(@wf-assert condition type msg args)</dt> 
 
<dd>If the condition is violated, <span class="v">okp</span> becomes <span class="v">nil</span> and we add 
a (non-fatal) warning of the indicated type, message, and arguments.</dd> 
 
<dt>(@wf-note condition type msg args)</dt> 
 
<dd>We add a warning of the indicated type, message, and args, to the list of 
warnings, but we do not set <span class="v">okp</span> to <span class="v">nil</span>.  That is, this is just a way 
to note suspicious things that aren't necessarily outright problems.</dd> 
 
<dt>(@wf-call other-wf-check ...)</dt> 
 
<dd>Becomes <span class="v">(other-wf-check-warn ...)</span>.  In other words, this allows you to 
call the vanilla version of some subsidiary well-formedness check from the 
vanilla version of your function, and the debugging version from your debugging 
function.</dd> 
 
</dl> 
 
<p>Note also that defwellformed-list allows you to call a 
well-formedness predicate on every element in a list, and that mutual-defwellformed is a replacement for <span class="v">mutual-recursion</span> that allows 
for the mutually-recursive use of <span class="v">defwellformed</span>.</p>
