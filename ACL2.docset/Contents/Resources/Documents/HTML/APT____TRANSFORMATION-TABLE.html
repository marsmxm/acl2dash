<p>APT transformation table.</p><p>This table records, for each successful call to an APT transformation, 
     the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> generated by the call. 
     This is used to support <a href="APT____REDUNDANCY.html">redundancy</a> checks for transformations.</p><p>Only transformation calls 
     whose <span class="v">:show-only</span> input is (perhaps by default) <span class="v">nil</span> 
     are recorded into the table by the transformations, 
     because calls whose <span class="v">:show-only</span> input is <span class="v">t</span> 
     do not affect the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>. 
     The <span class="v">:show-only</span> input, if present, is removed 
     prior to storing a call in the table 
     and prior to comparing a call with the keys in the table.</p><p>Since the <span class="v">:print</span> input to transformations only affects screen output, 
     it is similarly removed from a call 
     prior to storing a call in the table 
     and prior to comparing a call with the keys in the table.</p><p>The information associated with each call in the table 
     may be extended beyond the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> in the future.</p>
