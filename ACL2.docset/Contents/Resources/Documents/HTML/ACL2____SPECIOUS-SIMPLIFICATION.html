<p>Nonproductive proof steps</p><p>Occasionally the ACL2 theorem prover reports that the current goal 
 simplifies to itself or to a set including itself.  Such simplifications are 
 said to be ``specious'' and are ignored in the sense that the theorem prover 
 acts as though no simplification were possible and tries the next available 
 proof technique.  Specious simplifications are almost always caused by the use 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The simplification of a formula proceeds primarily by the local application 
 of <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span>, and other rules to 
 its various subterms.  If no rewrite rules apply, the formula cannot be 
 simplified and is passed to the next ACL2 proof technique, which is generally 
 the elimination of destructors.  The experienced ACL2 user pays special 
 attention to such ``maximally simplified'' formulas; the presence of 
 unexpected terms in them indicates the need for additional rules or the 
 presence of some conflict that prevents existing rules from working 
 harmoniously together.</p> 
 
 <p>However, consider the following interesting possibility: local rewrite 
 rules apply but, when applied, reproduce the goal as one of its own subgoals. 
 How can rewrite rules apply and reproduce the goal?  Of course, one way is for 
 one rule application to undo the effect of another, as when commutativity is 
 applied twice in succession to the same term.  Another kind of example is when 
 two rules conflict and undermine each other.  For example, under suitable 
 hypotheses, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> x)</span> might be rewritten to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))</span> 
 by the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a></span> and then a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule might be used to ``fold'' that back to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> x)</span>. 
 Generally speaking the presence of such ``looping'' rewrite rules causes 
 ACL2's simplifier either to stop gracefully because of heuristics such as that 
 described in the documentation for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a></span> or to cause a stack 
 overflow because of indefinite recursion.</p> 
 
 <p>A more insidious kind of loop can be imagined: two rewrites in different 
 parts of the formula undo each other's effects ``at a distance,'' that is, 
 without ever being applied to one another's output.  For example, perhaps the 
 first hypothesis of the formula is simplified to the second, but then the 
 second is simplified to the first, so that the end result is a formula 
 propositionally equivalent to the original one but with the two hypotheses 
 commuted.  This is thought to be impossible unless forcing or case-splitting 
 occurs, but if those features are exploited (see <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> and see <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a>) it can be made to happen relatively easily.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is a simple example.  Declare <span class="v">foo</span> to be a function of one 
 argument returning one result:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p1 (x) t)</pre> 
 
 <p>Prove the following silly rule:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bad
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a> (p1 x))
           (p1 x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now suppose we try the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (p1 x))</pre> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule <span class="v">bad</span> will rewrite <span class="v">(p1 x)</span> to <span class="v">t</span>, but it 
 will be unable to prove the hypothesis <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a> (p1 x))</span>.  As a result, 
 the prover will spawn a new goal, to prove <span class="v">(p1 x)</span>.  However, since this 
 new goal is the same as the original goal, ACL2 will recognize the 
 simplification as <i>specious</i> and consider the attempted simplification to 
 have failed.</p> 
 
 <p>In other words, despite the rewriting, no progress was made!  In more 
 common cases, the original goal may simplify to a set of subgoals, one of 
 which includes the original goal.</p> 
 
 <p>If ACL2 were to adopt the new set of subgoals, it would loop indefinitely. 
 Therefore, it checks whether the input goal is a member of the output 
 subgoals.  If so, it announces that the simplification is ``specious'' and 
 pretends that no simplification occurred.</p> 
 
 <p>``Maximally simplified'' formulas that produce specious simplifications are 
 maximally simplified in a very technical sense: were ACL2 to apply every 
 applicable rule to them, no progress would be made.  Since ACL2 can only apply 
 every applicable rule, it cannot make further progress with the formula.  But 
 the informed user can perhaps identify some rule that should not be applied 
 and make it inapplicable by disabling it, allowing the simplifier to apply all 
 the others and thus make progress.</p> 
 
 <p>When specious simplifications are a problem it might be helpful to <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> rules involved in forcing (including case-splits; see <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> 
 and see <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a>).  For the example above we see the following 
 output; and in fact, a hint to disable <span class="v">BAD</span> will avoid the specious 
 simplification (although the proof will still fail). 
 
 <pre class="code">Splitter note (see :DOC splitter) for Goal (0 subgoals).
  case-split: ((:REWRITE BAD))</pre> 
 
 A more drastic possibility is to disable all forcing (including <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a>s) and resubmit the formula to observe whether forcing is involved 
 in the loop or not.  The commands</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:disable-forcing
and
ACL2 !&gt;:enable-forcing</pre> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> and <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> the pragmatic effects of both <span class="v">force</span> 
 and <span class="v">case-split</span>.  If the loop is broken when forcing is <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d, 
 then it is very likely some <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>d hypothesis of some rule is 
 ``undoing'' a prior simplification.  The most common cause of this is when we 
 <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> a hypothesis that is actually false but whose falsity is somehow 
 temporarily hidden (more below).  To find the offending rule, compare the 
 specious simplification with its non-specious counterpart and look for rules 
 that were speciously applied that are not applied in the non-specious case. 
 Most likely you will find at least one such rule and it will have a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d hypothesis.  By disabling that rule, at least for the subgoal in 
 question, you may allow the simplifier to make progress on the subgoal.</p>
