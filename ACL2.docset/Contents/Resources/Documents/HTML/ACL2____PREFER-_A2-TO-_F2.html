<p>A small theory of lemmas that eliminate / in favor of *.</p><p>This is a small theory of rules that eliminate / from equalites and 
  inequalities in favor of *, e.g., <span class="v">x &lt; y/z</span> is rewritten to <span class="v">x*y &lt; z</span> 
  for positive z.  This theory is compatible with the ALGEBRA theories, i.e., 
  it should not cause looping.</p> 
 
  <p>These rules are not included in <a href="ACL2____RATIONALP-ALGEBRA.html">rationalp-algebra</a> because it is not 
  clear that we should prefer <span class="v">x*y &lt; z</span> to <span class="v">x &lt; y/z</span>, or <span class="v">x*y = z</span> to 
  <span class="v">x = y/z</span>. In the case of the lemma <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZE-EQUAL-_F2-TO-_A2.html">normalize-equal-/-to-*</a>, there 
  is no reason to suspect that `y' is a better term than `x'; in fact, the 
  whole point of the proofs using these libraries may have to do with a 
  representation involving /.  So, unless someone provides a convincing reason 
  to the contrary, these rules will remain separate from the <a href="ACL2____RATIONALP-ALGEBRA.html">rationalp-algebra</a> theory.</p> 
 
  <p>Note, however, that in certain cases this theory is just the thing that 
  needs to be ENABLEd to make the proofs work.  Keep it in mind.</p>
