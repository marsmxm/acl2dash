<p>An attribute- mechanism for suppressing particular <a href="VL2014____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> 
when using <a href="VL2014____LINT.html">lint</a>.</p><p>This is quick and dirty, but probably is actually a pretty 
effective and reasonable way to deal with suppressing unwanted warnings from 
VL-Lint.</p> 
 
<p>The basic idea is to stick attributes such as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> LINT_IGNORE *)</span> into 
the source code, which with our comment syntax can be done using the form 
<span class="v">//@VL LINT_IGNORE</span>, or similar.  We then look for these attributes to 
decide whether to suppress a warning.</p> 
 
<p>For convenience we treat <span class="v">LINT_IGNORE</span> directives in a case-insensitive 
way and treat _ interchangeably with -.  This is useful because the Verilog 
user typically has to use _ since these are attribute names and hence must be 
valid identifiers.</p> 
 
<p>We let the user write things like <span class="v">LINT_IGNORE_VL_WARN_ODDEXPR</span>, or, more 
conveniently, <span class="v">LINT_IGNORE_ODDEXPR</span>, by just "mashing" the tail of what 
they write by throwing away any leading <span class="v">VL_</span> or <span class="v">VL_WARN_</span> part.  By 
convention a plain <span class="v">LINT_IGNORE</span> with no further information means just 
ignore all warnings.</p>
