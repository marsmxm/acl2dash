 <p>By default, goals are not marked as checkpoints by a proof tree display (as 
 described elsewhere; see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>) merely because they <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> 
 some hypotheses, thus possibly contributing to a forcing round.  However, some 
 users may want such behavior, which will occur once the command 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-FORCED-GOALS.html">checkpoint-forced-goals</a></span> <span class="v">t</span>) has been executed.  To return to the 
 default behavior, use the command <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-FORCED-GOALS.html">checkpoint-forced-goals</a> nil)</span>.</p>
