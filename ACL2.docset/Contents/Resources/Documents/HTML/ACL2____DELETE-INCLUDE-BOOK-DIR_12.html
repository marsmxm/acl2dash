<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12">Click for Delete-include-book-dir! in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>ly unlink keyword for <span class="v">:dir</span> argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span></p><p>Please see <a href="ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">delete-include-book-dir</a>, which has completely 
 analogous syntax and semantics, but is used for removing associations 
 previously placed by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a></span>.  By contrast, 
 <span class="v">delete-include-book-dir!</span> removes associations previously placed by 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">add-include-book-dir!</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> 
 but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded.</p> 
 
 <p>This macro is essentially a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span> event that updates the table 
 <span class="v">include-book-dir!-table</span>, which associates keywords with absolute 
 pathnames.  However, as with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">delete-include-book-dir</a></span>, direct table 
 updates are disallowed; you must use <span class="v">delete-include-book-dir!</span> to remove 
 from the table and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">add-include-book-dir!</a></span> to add to the table.</p> 
 
 <p>It is illegal to call <span class="v">delete-include-book-dir!</span> in a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> 
 context.  For an explanation, see <a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">add-include-book-dir!</a>.</p>
