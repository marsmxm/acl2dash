<p>Macros to formalize more concisely 
          ACL2 functions over the Java primitive values.</p><p>The ACL2 functions that formalize Java primitive operations and conversions 
     have the following structure: 
     they take one (if unary) or two (if binary) primitive values as arguments; 
     they use primitive value destructors (e.g. <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____INT-VALUE-_E3INT.html">int-value-&gt;int</a></span>) 
     to obtain the ``core'' values to operate upon with existing ACL2 functions; 
     they use existing ACL2 functions to generate the ``core'' result; 
     they uses primitive value constructors (e.g. <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____INT-VALUE.html">int-value</a></span>) 
     to return the result primitive value.</p><p>The only ``interesting'' part is how the core result 
     is calculated from the core arguments via existing ACL2 functions. 
     The rest is boilerplate that can be automatically generated, 
     which we do via macros.</p><p>We introduce two general macros: 
     one for unary functions, and one for binary functions. 
     These can generate functions over primitive values 
     of any combination of operand and result types, 
     which are all explicitly specified. 
     Since certain combinations of operand and result types 
     are shared by certain collections of primitive operations, 
     we also introduce more specialized macros for these combinations.</p><p>These macros also provide options 
     to generate certain kinds of theorems about the operations, 
     e.g. commutativity theorems.</p>
