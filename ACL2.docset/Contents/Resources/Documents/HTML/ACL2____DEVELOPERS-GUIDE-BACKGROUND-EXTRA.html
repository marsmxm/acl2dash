<p>Some Implementation Background Extra Information</p><p>Here is a call tree built bottom-up when exploring how <span class="v">thm-fn</span> 
 calls the rewriter, which is an exercise suggested in the section, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-BACKGROUND.html">developers-guide-background</a>.  There are a few extra nodes in this tree, 
 obtained by looking for callers of <span class="v">rewrite</span> and of <span class="v">prove</span>.</p>
