</dl><p>In the Verilog sources, continuous assignment statements can take 
two forms, as illustrated below.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module m (a, b, c) ;
  wire w1 = a &amp; b ;     // &lt;-- continuous assignment in a declaration
  wire w2;
  assign w2 = w1;       // &lt;-- continuous assignment
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Regardless of which form is used, the <a href="VL2014____PARSER.html">parser</a> generates a 
<span class="v">vl-assign-p</span> object.  Note that the following is also legal Verilog:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign foo = 1, bar = 2;</pre> 
 
<p>But in such cases, the parser will create two <span class="v">vl-assign-p</span> objects, one 
to represent the assignment to <span class="v">foo</span>, and the other to represent the 
assignment to <span class="v">bar</span>.  Hence, each <span class="v">vl-assign-p</span> represents only a single 
assignment.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Lvalue</h4> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">lvalue</span> field must be an expression, and represents the location 
being assigned to.  The formal syntax definition for Verilog only permits 
lvalues to be:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>identifiers,</li> 
 <li>bit- or part-selects, and</li> 
 <li>concatenations of the above.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Furthermore, from Table 6.1, (p. 68), we find that only <span class="v">net</span> 
declarations are permitted in continuous assignments; <span class="v">reg</span>s, <span class="v">integer</span>s, 
and other variables must be assigned only using procedural assignments.  We 
have experimentally verified (see <span class="v">test-assign.v</span>) that Cadence enforces 
these rules.</p> 
 
<p>Our parser does impose these syntactic restrictions, but in <span class="v">vl-assign-p</span> 
we are perhaps overly permissive, and we only require that the <span class="v">lvalue</span> is 
an expression.  Even so, some transforms may cause fatal warnings if these 
semantic restrictions are violated, so one must be careful when generating 
assignments.</p> 
 
<h4>Expr</h4> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">expr</span> is the expression being assigned to this lvalue.  We do not in 
any way restrict the expression, nor have we found any restrictions discussed 
in the Verilog-2005 standard.  Even so, it seems there must be some limits. 
For instance, what does it mean to assign, say, a minimum/typical/maximum delay 
expression?  For these sorts of reasons, some transforms may wish to only 
permit a subset of all expressions here.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Delay</h4> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">delay</span> for a continuous assignment is discussed in 6.1.3 (page 71), 
and specifies how long it takes for a change in the value of the right-hand 
side to be propagated into the lvalue.  We represent the delay using a <a href="VL2014____VL-MAYBE-GATEDELAY-P.html">vl-maybe-gatedelay-p</a>; if the <span class="v">delay</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, it means that no delay 
was specified.</p> 
 
<p>Note (6.1.3) that when delays are provided in the combined declaration and 
assignment statement, e.g., </p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire #10 a = 1, b = 2;</pre> 
 
<p>that the delay is to be associated with each assignment, and NOT with the 
net declaration for <span class="v">a</span>.  Net delays are different than assignment delays; 
see <a href="VL2014____VL-VARDECL.html">vl-vardecl</a> for additional discussion.</p> 
 
<p><b>Warning:</b> Although the parser is careful to handle the delay 
correctly, we are generally uninterested in delays and our transforms may not 
properly preserve them.</p> 
 
<p><b>BOZO</b> Presumably the default delay is zero?  Haven't seen that yet, 
though.</p> 
 
<h4>Strength</h4> 
 
<p>Strengths on continuous assignments are discussed in 6.1.4.  We represent 
the strength using a <a href="VL2014____VL-MAYBE-GATESTRENGTH-P.html">vl-maybe-gatestrength-p</a>.  If a strength is not 
provided, the parser sets this to <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
<p><b>Warning:</b> Although the parser is careful to handle the strength 
correctly, we are generally uninterested in strengths and our transforms may not 
properly preserve them.</p>
