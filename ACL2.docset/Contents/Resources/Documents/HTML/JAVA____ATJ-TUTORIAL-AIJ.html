<p>ATJ tutorial: Relationship with AIJ.</p><p>This tutorial page clarifies the relationship between ATJ and AIJ.</p><h5>Purpose of AIJ</h5><p><a href="JAVA____AIJ.html">AIJ</a> is related to, but independent from, ATJ. 
    ATJ generates Java code that needs at least part of AIJ to run: 
    in this sense, ATJ depends on AIJ. 
    Although the development of AIJ has been motivated by ATJ, 
    AIJ does not need or depend on ATJ: 
    it can be used independently. 
    However, AIJ's main use is as support for ATJ.</p><h5>More Information on AIJ</h5><p>See <a href="JAVA____AIJ.html">the AIJ manual page</a> for information about AIJ as a stand-alone entity, 
    independent from ATJ. 
    However, this ATJ tutorial will describe many aspects of AIJ 
    that are necessary or useful to understand and use ATJ.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Previous:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-BACKGROUND.html">Background on the Evaluation Semantics of ACL2</a></p><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-SIMPLIFIED-UML.html">About the Simplified UML Class Diagrams</a></p>
