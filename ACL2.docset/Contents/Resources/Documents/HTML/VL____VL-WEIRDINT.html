<p>Representation for constant integer literals with any X or Z bits, 
           e.g., <span class="v">4'b11xx</span>.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-VALUE.html">vl-value</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>bits — <a href="VL____VL-BITLIST.html">vl-bitlist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>An MSB-first list of the four-valued Verilog bits making up 
                  this constant's value; see <a href="VL____VL-BIT-P.html">vl-bit-p</a>.</dd> 
 
<dt>origsign — <a href="VL____VL-EXPRSIGN-P.html">vl-exprsign-p</a>

          <p>Weird integers are produced by source code constructs like 
          <span class="v">1'bz</span>, <span class="v">3'b0X1</span>, and so on.</p> 
 
          <p>Weirdints are mostly like <a href="VL____VL-CONSTINT.html">vl-constint</a>s except that instead 
          of having a natural number <span class="v">value</span> they have <span class="v">bits</span>, a list of 
          four-valued <a href="VL____VL-BIT.html">vl-bit</a>s, which are always represented in MSB-first 
          order.</p> 
 
          <p>The <span class="v">origsign</span> and <span class="v">wasunsized</span> fields are analogous to 
          those from a <a href="VL____VL-CONSTINT.html">vl-constint</a>; see the discussion there for 
          details.</p> 
 
          <p>Unlike a constint, a weirdint has no <span class="v">origwidth</span>.  Instead, its 
          original width is implicitly just the length of its bits.  When our 
          <a href="VL____LEXER.html">lexer</a> encounters a weirdint like <span class="v">5'b1x</span>, it automatically 
          extends it to the desired width; see for instance <a href="VL____VL-CORRECT-BITLIST.html">vl-correct-bitlist</a>.  Note that, as with constints, you usually 
          <b>should not</b> be looking at this length or at the <span class="v">origsign</span> 
          field, because these original values are not necessarily the correct 
          post-sizing sizes and signedness.</p> 
 
          <p>Like constinsts, all weirdints are automatically constructed with 
          <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>.  This may not be worthwhile since there are probably 
          usually not too many weirdints, but by the same reasoning it 
          shouldn't be too harmful.</p>
