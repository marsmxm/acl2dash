<p>The <span class="v">DeadCodeEliminator</span> transformation.</p><p>This is described in 
     [Solidity: Internals: The Optimizer: Yul-Based Optimizer Module: 
      Statement-Scale Simplifications: DeadCodeEliminator]. 
     The description mentions not only <span class="v">break</span>, <span class="v">continue</span> and <span class="v">leave</span>, 
     but also other constructs that are presumably part of the EVM dialect; 
     since they are not part of our formalization, 
     we do not handle the latter for now.</p><p>We define this transformation assuming that 
     <span class="v">FunctionHoister</span> and <span class="v">FunctionGrouper</span> have already run: 
     this means that all the functions are all 
     immediately contained in the top-level block, 
     where `immediately' means that 
     there are no intervening blocks in between, 
     i.e. the function definitions are not contained in nested blocks. 
     This condition is formalized in <a href="YUL____NO-FUNCTION-DEFINITIONS.html">no-function-definitions</a> 
     (actually, for now only part of those conditions is formalized there, 
     but we plan to extend that formalization). 
     We do not represent this condition in the guards, 
     for greater flexibility and simplicity, 
     but the correctness theorems for this tranformation 
     use that condition as hypothesis.</p><p>Here is some elaboration on not representing that condition in the guards. 
     If we used <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____BLOCK-NOFUNP.html">block-nofunp</a></span> as guard of <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____BLOCK-DEAD.html">block-dead</a></span>, 
     then we could not use <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____BLOCK-DEAD.html">block-dead</a></span> for the top-level block, 
     which does not satisfy <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____BLOCK-NOFUNP.html">block-nofunp</a></span>. 
     Also, as we need to extend the <span class="v">...-dead</span> transformations 
     from syntactic to semantics entities in <a href="YUL____DEAD-CODE-ELIMINATOR-EXECUTION.html">the proof of dynamic correctness</a>, we would have to extend the <span class="v">-...-nofunp</span> functions 
     to those semantics entities as well in order to verify the guards. 
     For these reasons, i.e. flexibility and simplicity respectively, 
     we do not use <span class="v">...-nofunp</span> as guards in <span class="v">...-dead</span>.</p>
