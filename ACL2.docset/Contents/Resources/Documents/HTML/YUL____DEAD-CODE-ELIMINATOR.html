<p>The <span class="v">DeadCodeEliminator</span> transformation.</p><p>This is described in 
     [Solidity: Internals: The Optimizer: Yul-Based Optimizer Module: 
      Statement-Scale Simplifications: DeadCodeEliminator]. 
     The description mentions not only <span class="v">leave</span>, <span class="v">break</span> and <span class="v">continue</span>, 
     but also other constructs that are presumably part of the EVM dialect; 
     since they are not part of our formalization, 
     we do not handle the latter for now.</p>
