<p>ACL2 features not supported in ACL2(p)</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic relates to the experimental 
 extension of ACL2 supporting parallel execution and proof; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.  See <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM-TUTORIAL.html">parallelism-tutorial</a> for an introduction to parallel 
 programming in ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>For proof features of ACL2 that are not yet supported when parallel 
 execution is enabled for the primary ACL2 proof process, generally known as 
 ``the waterfall'', see <a href="ACL2____UNSUPPORTED-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM-FEATURES.html">unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Please note that this topic discusses ACL2 features that are disabled when 
 using ACL2(p) (see <a href="ACL2____COMPILING-ACL2P.html">compiling-ACL2p</a>).  These features are disabled 
 regardless of whether waterfall parallelism is enabled.</p> 
 
 <p>Calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OBSERVATION-CW.html">observation-cw</a></span> simply convert to calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span>, so 
 suppressing <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OBSERVATION.html">observation</a></span>s (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>) will not 
 suppress these messages.</p> 
 
 <p>Memoization is not supported when executing in parallel.  See <a href="ACL2____UNSUPPORTED-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM-FEATURES.html">Unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features</a> for memoization details related to 
 waterfall parallelism.</p> 
 
 <p>Since, as of April 2012, garbage collection is inherently sequential, 
 ACL2(p) minimizes the use of garbage collection by setting a high garbage 
 collection threshold.  As a result, ACL2(p) is not expected to perform well on 
 machines with less memory than this threshold (1 gigabyte, as of April 
 2012).</p> 
 
 <p>In CCL, the underlying parallel execution engine is tuned for the number of 
 CPU cores (or hardware threads) actually available in the machine.  SBCL and 
 LispWorks are tuned for a machine with 16 CPU cores.</p> 
 
 <p>CCL is considered to be the ``flagship Lisp'' for parallel execution in 
 ACL2.  The SBCL and LispWorks implementations are thought to be generally 
 stable.  However, due to their relatively less common use, the SBCL and 
 LispWorks implementations are likely less robust than the CCL 
 implementation.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a></span> utility is a no-op for ACL2(p).</p> 
 
 <p>When executing calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-GET.html">hons-get</a></span> in parallel, you may see messages 
 about <span class="v">"Fast alist discipline"</span> violations.  This can happen because each 
 thread uses its own underlying hash-table for fast access by <span class="v">hons-get</span>, 
 but typical top-level calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-ACONS.html">hons-acons</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-FAST-ALIST.html">make-fast-alist</a></span> 
 only affect that main thread's hash-table.  You can use 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-SLOW-ALIST-ACTION.html">set-slow-alist-action</a> nil)</span> to eliminate this warning entirely; see <a href="ACL2____SLOW-ALIST-WARNING.html">slow-alist-warning</a>.</p>
