<p>Utilities to generate events in event macros.</p><p>These utilities return two results: 
     a local event form, and a non-local one. 
     The assumption is that the event macro generates an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> 
     inside which the events generated by these utilities: 
     thus, the local event is local to the encapsulate, 
     while the non-local one is exported from the encapsulate. 
     The local event includes proof hints, while the exported one doesn't: 
     this way, the ACL2 history after the encapsulate is ``clean'', 
     without hints that may refer to local theorems, in particular.</p><p>A caller of these utilities may use these utilities 
     also to generate a local-only event, 
     simply by ignoring the second result. 
     In cases in which the local and exported events are the same 
     (except for the <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> ...)</span> wrapper, 
     a caller of these utilities can ignore the first result.</p>
