<p>(primitive) 
move to the indicated subterm</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(DIVE 1)    -- assign the new current subterm to be the first
               argument of the existing current subterm
(DIVE 1 2)  -- assign the new current subterm to be the result of
               first taking the 1st argument of the existing
               current subterm, and then the 2nd argument of that</pre> 
 
 <p>For example, if the current subterm is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> a b) c),</pre> 
 
 <p>then after <span class="v">(dive 1)</span> it is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> a b).</pre> 
 
 <p>If after that, then <span class="v">(dive 2)</span> is invoked, the new current subterm will 
 be</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">b.</pre> 
 
 <p>Instead of <span class="v">(dive 1)</span> followed by <span class="v">(dive 2)</span>, the same current 
 subterm could be obtained by instead submitting the single instruction 
 <span class="v">(dive 1 2)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(dive &amp;rest naturals-list)</pre> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">naturals-list</span> is a non-empty list <span class="v">(n_1 ... n_k)</span> of natural 
 numbers, let the new current subterm be the result of selecting the 
 <span class="v">n_1</span>-st argument of the current subterm, and then the <span class="v">n_2</span>-th subterm 
 of that, ..., finally the <span class="v">n_k</span>-th subterm.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> <span class="v">Dive</span> is related to the command <span class="v">pp</span>, in that the 
 diving is done according to raw (translated, internal form) syntax.  Use the 
 command <span class="v">dv</span> if you want to dive according to the syntax displayed by the 
 command <span class="v">p</span>.  Note that <span class="v">(dv n)</span> can be abbreviated by simply 
 <span class="v">n</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> Emacs users who load (into Emacs) the file 
 <span class="v">emacs/acl2-doc.el</span> will have defined a command, <span class="v">Control-t Control-d</span>, 
 that avoids the need to type <span class="v">dive</span> commands.  After you print the current 
 term using the <span class="v">pp</span> command, you may position the cursor on a subterm and 
 type <span class="v">Control-t Control-d</span>.  Emacs will respond by pasting the appropriate 
 <span class="v">dive</span> command immediately after the interactive proof-builder's prompt. 
 You can then simply type <span class="v">&lt;RETURN&gt;</span> in order to dive to the desired 
 subterm.</p>
