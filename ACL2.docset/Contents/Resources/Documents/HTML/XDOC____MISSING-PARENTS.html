<p>Placeholder for documentation topics that lack <span class="v">:parents</span>.</p><p>If a <a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> form ends up having no parents, it ends up 
being put here.  See also <a href="ACL2____UNDOCUMENTED.html">undocumented</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Historic note.  We used to put these topics directly underneath <a href="ACL2____TOP.html">top</a> 
instead.  But we found that during development, this sometimes led to a 
strange-looking hierarchy where ``random'' topics were presented as top-level 
topics just because they were new or being moved around or because <a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-PARENTS.html">set-default-parents</a> forms weren't quite in the right places.  To avoid this, 
we now move these topics to <span class="v">missing-parents</span> and print notes about them 
when a manual is saved with <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">save</a>.</p>
