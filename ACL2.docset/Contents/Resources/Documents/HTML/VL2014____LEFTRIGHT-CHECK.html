<p>Check for strange expressions like <span class="v">A [op] A</span>.</p><p>This is a heuristic for generating warnings, inspired by PVS 
Studio.  It has found a few pretty minor things that we were able to clean up, 
and also found one interesting copy/paste bug.</p> 
 
<p>We look for identical sub-expressions on the left and right of most binary 
operations, for instance <span class="v">A | A</span> and <span class="v">A == A</span>.  It is usually pretty 
strange to write such an expression, and sometimes these indicate copy/paste 
errors.  We do similar checking for the then- and else-branches of <span class="v">?:</span> 
operators.</p> 
 
<p>We also look for part-selects that use the same expressions for both 
indices, e.g., <span class="v">foo[3:3]</span>, but these are somewhat more common and minor, and 
sometimes result from macros or parameterized modules, so we generally think 
these are pretty minor and uninteresting.</p>
