<p>Internal state object used throughout the VL loading routines.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>config — <a href="VL____VL-LOADCONFIG.html">vl-loadconfig</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Original configuration passed to <a href="VL____VL-LOAD.html">vl-load</a>.  This remains 
               constant throughout our loading routines.</dd> 
 
<dt>descs — <a href="VL____VL-DESCRIPTIONLIST.html">vl-descriptionlist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Top-level descriptions (modules, packages, interfaces, etc.)  we 
               have loaded so far.  These descriptions have been only minimally 
               transformed, and are intended to capture the actual source code 
               in the files on disk.  These are always kept in the reverse 
               order that they are encountered (i.e., accumulator style), which 
               is important for lexical scoping.</dd> 
 
<dt>descalist</dt> 
<dd>Fast alist of description names, for fast lookups.</dd> 
 
<dt>defines — <a href="VL____VL-DEFINES.html">vl-defines</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The current set of <span class="v">`define</span>s at any point in time.</dd> 
 
<dt>iskips — <a href="VL____VL-INCLUDESKIPS.html">vl-includeskips</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Supports multiple-include optimization in the <a href="VL____PREPROCESSOR.html">preprocessor</a>.</dd> 
 
<dt>ifdefmap — <a href="VL____VL-IFDEF-USE-MAP.html">vl-ifdef-use-map</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Log of which <span class="v">`define</span>s are used by <span class="v">`ifdef</span>s.</dd> 
 
<dt>defmap — <a href="VL____VL-DEF-USE-MAP.html">vl-def-use-map</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Log of which <span class="v">`define</span>s are used by non-<span class="v">`ifdef</span>s.</dd> 
 
<dt>idcache — <a href="VL____VL-DIRLIST-CACHE.html">vl-dirlist-cache</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Cache for the contents of the :include-dirs.</dd> 
 
<dt>spcache — <a href="VL____VL-DIRXLIST-CACHE.html">vl-dirxlist-cache</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Cache for the contents of the :search-path.</dd> 
 
<dt>reportcard — <a href="VL____VL-REPORTCARD.html">vl-reportcard</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Main storage for load-time warnings that we want to associate 
                with particular descriptions.  This is where most load-time 
                warnings from loading are kept during loading.  At the end of 
                loading, these warnings get injected into the actual 
                descriptions they pertain to.</dd> 
 
<dt>pstate — <a href="VL____VL-PARSESTATE.html">vl-parsestate</a>
</dt> 
<dd>State that the parser needs.  BOZO probably we should consider 
               moving some of the loadstate into the pstate.  This holds, among 
               other things, any "floating" warnings that aren't associated 
               with any description.  But few warnings get put here. Instead, 
               most warnings get associated with particular descriptions. But 
               some warnings from the early stages of file loading (like 
               preprocessing and lexing), or warnings about malformed syntax 
               that occurs <i>between</i> descriptions, can end up here.</dd> 
 
<dt>filemap — <a href="VL____VL-FILEMAP.html">vl-filemap</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Database mapping the names of files we have read to their contents. 
               This is occasionally useful for seeing the original code for a 
               description.  To save memory, you can avoid constructing this 
               alist; see the <span class="v">filemapp</span> option in <a href="VL____VL-LOADCONFIG-P.html">vl-loadconfig-p</a>.</dd> 
 
<dt>bytes — <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Total bytes of input files read so far.</dd>
