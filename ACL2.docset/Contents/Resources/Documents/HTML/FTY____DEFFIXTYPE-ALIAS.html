<p>Introduce an alias of an existing fixtype.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Sometimes a fixtype, as well as its recognizer, fixer, and equivalence, 
     have names that are appropriate in a general context, 
     but that could be made more convenient and readable 
     in a more restrictive context. 
     For instance, the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE4.html">ACL2::ubyte4</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8.html">ACL2::ubyte8</a></span> fixtypes 
     (and their recognizers, fixers, and equivalences) 
     are named according to 
     a uniform scheme in <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFBYTE-STANDARD-INSTANCES.html">defbyte-standard-instances</a></span>, 
     but in many contexts the names <span class="v">nibble</span> and <span class="v">byte</span> 
     would be arguably more convenient.</p><p>Instead of defining new fixtypes, recognizers, fixers, and equivalences 
     with the desired names, 
     and inevitably having to introduce theorems about them, 
     it is preferable to introduce and use aliases. 
     ACL2 has built-in support to do this for functions, 
     via <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-FN.html">add-macro-fn</a></span>. 
     For the fixtypes themselves, i.e. for the fixtype names, 
     aliases can be actually created via <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFIXTYPE.html">deffixtype</a></span>, 
     which simply records (in the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>) 
     the association between the fixtype name 
     and its recognizer, fixer, and equivalence: 
     by calling <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFIXTYPE.html">deffixtype</a></span> 
     with the aliases for recognizer, fixer, and equivalence, 
     we effectively create an alias of the existing fixtype.</p><p>This macro automates this process. 
     It introduces 
     macro aliases for a fixtype's recognizer, fixer, and equivalence, 
     along with a new fixtype associated to such aliases, 
     which is effectively an alias of the existing fixtype.</p><h3>General Form</h3><pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFFIXTYPE-ALIAS.html">deffixtype-alias</a> alias
