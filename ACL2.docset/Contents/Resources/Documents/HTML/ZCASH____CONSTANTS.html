<p>Constants used in Zcash.</p><p>This is for the constants listed in [ZPS:5.3]. 
     Those are not all the constants, as such, used in Zcash; 
     however, those have a dedicated section explicitly titled `Constants'.</p><p>For now we only capture some of them. 
     More will be added as needed.</p>
