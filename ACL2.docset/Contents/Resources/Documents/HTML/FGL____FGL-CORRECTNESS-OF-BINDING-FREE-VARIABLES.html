<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=FGL____FGL-CORRECTNESS-OF-BINDING-FREE-VARIABLES">Click for Fgl-correctness-of-binding-free-variables in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Discussion of the logical justification for the <a href="FGL____BIND-VAR.html">bind-var</a> feature.</p><p>FGL's <a href="FGL____BIND-VAR.html">bind-var</a> feature can be used to bind a free variable 
in a rewrite rule to some arbitrary value.  Here we discuss how the correctness 
of that feature may be formalized.  Note we discuss this with respect to 
<span class="v">bind-var</span>, but it applies to binder functions generally.</p> 
 
<h3>Requirements and Basic Idea</h3> 
 
<p>First we describe the requirements for using the <span class="v">bind-var</span> feature.  We 
must first have a rewrite rule containing a call of bind-var in either the RHS 
or a hyp.  Then, if and when symbolic execution reaches the call of bind-var, 
it must be the case that the first argument of <span class="v">bind-var</span> is a variable that 
is not yet bound in the current frame (this is checked in the interpreter).  If 
this is the case, the interpreter may add a binding for that variable to any 
object; in particular, it interprets the second argument of <span class="v">bind-var</span> under 
the trivial equivalence <a href="FGL____UNEQUIV.html">unequiv</a> (meaning that the value returned is 
not important for soundness) and binds it to that value.</p> 
 
<p>The justification for this is essentially that all free variables in a 
theorem are universally quantified.  When we apply a rewrite rule, we start 
with the free variables of the LHS bound to the unifying substitution.  We are 
free to bind any other variables that are mentioned in the theorem to whatever 
values we want, because the unifying substitution contains all variables of the 
LHS, so extending the unifying substitution to include additional variables 
won't change the value of the LHS under that substitution.</p> 
 
<h3>Technical Problem and Solutions</h3> 
<p>There is a technical problem with this when these free variables appear 
inside lambda bodies.  ACL2 term translation ensures that all lambdas bind all 
the free variables of their bodies -- when it translates a lambda that has free 
variables in the body, it adds bindings for those variables to themselves.  So 
if we have a rewrite rule like this:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (foo x)
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((a (bar x))
              (c (<a href="FGL____BIND-VAR.html">bind-var</a> b (baz x a))))
           ...))</pre> 
<p>then the outside of the RHS looks like this:</p> 
<pre class="code">((<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (a x b) ...)
 (bar x) x b)</pre> 
 
<p>We interpret the arguments of a lambda or function call before the body, and 
normally if we encounter an unbound variable during symbolic execution we 
produce an error.  Therefore, we would run into an error when we process the 
argument <span class="v">b</span> of the lambda call.  To avoid this and get the intended 
behavior of binding <span class="v">b</span> when we arrive at its <span class="v">bind-var</span> form, we 
preprocess lambdas to remove bindings of variables to themselves, instead 
carrying forward the existing bindings from the outer context into the lambda 
body. (See ACL2 community book "centaur/meta/bindinglist.lisp" for the 
implementation.)</p> 
 
<p>A further complication is that when we bind a free variable due to 
<span class="v">bind-var</span>, it must be bound in the context of the current rewrite rule 
application, not just the current lambda body.  To do otherwise would allow 
that variable to be bound to different objects in a single application of the 
rule.  To deal with this, we effectively have two levels of variable bindings 
at any time: the major frame produced by the current rewrite rule 
application, which has a wholly new namespace for variables, and a minor 
frameproduced by each nesting of lambdas, which carries forward all 
variable bindings from the previous minor frame and may shadow variable 
bindings from the major frame.  When we add a variable binding with 
<span class="v">bind-var</span>, that binding goes into the bindings of the major frame.</p> 
 
<h3>Statement of Correctness</h3> 
 
<p>Finally we discuss how the <span class="v">bind-var</span> feature affects how we state the 
correctness of the FGL symbolic interpreter.</p> 
 
<p>The correctness of a typical rewriter that takes an alist of variable 
bindings is along the lines of:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(equivalent-under-relation equiv-relation-context
                           (eval-term input-term (eval-bindings bindings env))
                           (eval-term result-term env))</pre> 
 
<p>Here equiv-relation-context, input-term, and bindings are inputs to the 
rewriter, which produces result-term.</p> 
 
<p>The exact such correctness statement for FGL involves various complications 
that we won't discuss here, such as the distinction between input ACL2 terms 
and output symbolic objects and various invariants of the interpreter state. 
The main complication that we will discuss is that, rather than just an input 
to the rewriter as would be the case in a typical rewriter, the relevant 
bindings are changed (extended) by the rewriter as it (potentially) adds 
variable bindings to the major frame due to <span class="v">bind-var</span>.  So the statement we 
want (again, very approximately) is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(equivalent-under-relation
  equiv-relation-context
  (eval-term input-term (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (eval-bindings output-minor-bindings env)
                                (eval-bindings output-major-bindings env)))
  (eval-term result-term env))</pre> 
 
<p>(To simplify this slightly, we do show that the evaluation of the output and 
input minor bindings is equivalent.)</p> 
 
<p>This is reasonable and true, but it isn't sufficiently strong to be 
inductively proved.  The problem is that if we successively rewrite two terms, 
the output major bindings from the second term may be different from those from 
the first, so the inductive assumption from the first term doesn't help us 
anymore.</p> 
 
<p>To fix this, we instead prove, approximately:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> ext
        (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (eval-alist-extension-p
                   ext
                   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (eval-bindings output-minor-bindings env)
                           (eval-bindings output-major-bindings env)))
                 (equivalent-under-relation equiv-relation-context
                                            (eval-term input-term ext)
                                            (eval-term result-term env))))</pre> 
 
<p>Where <span class="v">(eval-alist-extension-p a b)</span> holds when <span class="v">a</span> binds all keys 
present in <span class="v">b</span> to the same values.  Since the rewriter only adds pairs to 
the major bindings whose keys are not yet bound in either the major or minor 
bindings, the resulting appended, evaluated minor and major bindings is such an 
extension of the input appended, evaluated major and minor bindings.  This 
allows the inductive assumption about the first term to be applied to the 
bindings resulting from rewriting the second term.</p>
