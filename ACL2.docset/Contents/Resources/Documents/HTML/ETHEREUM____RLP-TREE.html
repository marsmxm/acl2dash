<p>An RLP tree has 
       a <a href="ETHEREUM____BYTE-ARRAYS.html">byte array</a> at each leaf. 
       A branching node of the tree carries no additional information 
       besides the structure implied by 
       the sequence of its (zero or more) subtrees.</p><p>The definition of type <span class="v">rlp-tree</span> 
       corresponds to \mathbb{T} [YP:(176)]. 
       The definition of type <span class="v">rlp-tree-list</span> 
       corresponds to \mathbb{L} [YP:(177)]; 
       we use true lists to model sequences of subtrees.</p><p>These trees are called `items' in [Wiki:RLP]; 
       we prefer the term `tree', because it seems clearer. 
       The byte sequences at the leaves are called 
       `byte arrays' in [YP:B] and [Wiki:RLP], and also `strings' in [Wiki:RLP]; 
       we prefer the former term, because it seems clearer.</p>
