<p>Read a serialized ACL2 object from a file</p><p>General form:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE-READ.html">serialize-read</a> filename
                [:hons-mode {:always, :never, :smart}]   ; :smart by default
                [:verbosep  {t, nil}])                   ; nil by default
 --&gt;
(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> obj state)</pre> 
 
 <p>In the logic this is an oracle read.</p> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, we try to read and return a serialized object from a file 
 that was presumably created by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE-WRITE.html">serialize-write</a></span>.  On success we return 
 the contents of the file.  Any failures (e.g., file not found, bad file 
 contents, etc.) will result in a hard Lisp error.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">filename</span> should be a string that gives the path to the file.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">hons-mode</span> controls how whether to use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span> 
 to restore the object.  The default mode is <span class="v">:smart</span>, which means that 
 conses that were <a href="ACL2____NORMED.html">normed</a> at the time of the file's creation should be 
 restored with <span class="v">hons</span>.  But you can override this and insist that <span class="v">hons</span> 
 is to <span class="v">:always</span> or <span class="v">:never</span> be used, instead.</p> 
 
 <p>Why would you use <span class="v">:never</span>?  If your object previously had a lot of 
 honses, but you no longer have any need for them to be normed, then using 
 <span class="v">:never</span> may sometimes be a lot faster since it can avoid <span class="v">hons</span> calls. 
 On the other hand, if you are going to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-COPY.html">hons-copy</a></span> some part of the 
 file's contents, then it is likely faster to use <span class="v">:smart</span> or <span class="v">:always</span> 
 instead of first creating normal conses and then copying them to build 
 honses.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:verbosep</span> flag just controls whether to print some low-level 
 details related to timing and memory usage as the file is being read.</p>
