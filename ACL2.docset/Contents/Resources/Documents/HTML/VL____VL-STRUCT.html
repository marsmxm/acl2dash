<p>A SystemVerilog <span class="v">struct</span> datatype, or an array of structs.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE.html">vl-datatype</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>

                in order.</dd>

<dt>signedp  <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Roughly: says whether this struct is <span class="v">signed</span> or not, 
                but <b>warning!</b> this is really complicated and generally 
                should not be used; see below for details.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>If you look at the SystemVerilog grammar you might notice that 
            there aren't unpacked dimensions:</p> 
 
            <pre class="code">data_type ::= ... | struct_union [ 'packed' [signing] ] '{'
                      struct_union_member { struct_union_member }
                    '}' { packed_dimension }</pre> 
 
            <p>But it seems much cleaner to make the unpacked dimensions part 
            of a structure, so when we deal with a variable declaration 
            like:</p> 
 
            <pre class="code">mystruct_t [3:0] foo [4:0];</pre> 
 
            <p>We can record, in the type of <span class="v">foo</span> itself, all of the 
            relevant type information, instead of having to keep the unpacked 
            dimensions separated.</p> 
 
            <h3>Warning about Packedp and Signedp</h3> 
 
            <p>The packedness/signedness of structures/arrays is complicated; 
            you should usually use utilities like <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE-PACKEDP.html">vl-datatype-packedp</a> 
            and <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE-ARITHCLASS.html">vl-datatype-arithclass</a> instead of directly using the 
            <span class="v">packedp</span> and <span class="v">signedp</span> fields.</p> 
 
            <p>What are the issues?  At parse time, we use the <span class="v">packedp</span> and 
            <span class="v">signedp</span> fields to record whether the struct was declared to be 
            packed and/or signed.</p> 
 
            <p>For a single (non-array) structure, <span class="v">packedp</span> is basically 
            correct, except that BOZO really we should be checking that all of 
            the members of the struct are packed as well.  But for arrays of 
            structs, even if the struct itself is packed, the array itself 
            might be unpacked.  For instance, if we write:</p> 
 
            <pre class="code">struct packed { logic [3:0] a; logic [3:0] b; } myvar [3:0];</pre> 
 
            <p>then <span class="v">myvar</span> will be marked as packed, but this packedness 
            refers to the <i>elements</i> of <span class="v">myvar</span> instead of to 
            <span class="v">myvar</span> itself!</p> 
 
            <p>Signedness has similar issues except that it is more 
            complicated; see the documentation in <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE-ARITHCLASS.html">vl-datatype-arithclass</a> 
            and also <a href="VL____VL-USERTYPE.html">vl-usertype</a> for more details.</p>
