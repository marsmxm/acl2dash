<p>Returning a multiple value</p><p><span class="v">Mv</span> is the mechanism provided by ACL2 for returning two or more 
 values.  Logically, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> x1 x2 ... xn)</span> is the same as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x1 x2
 ... xn)</span>, a list of the indicated values.  However, ACL2 avoids the cost of 
 building this list structure, with the cost that <span class="v">mv</span> may only be used in a 
 certain style in definitions: if a function ever returns using <span class="v">mv</span> (either 
 directly, or by calling another function that returns a multiple value), then 
 this function must always return the same number of values.</p> 
 
 <p>For more explanation of the multiple value mechanism, see <a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a>. 
 Also see <a href="ACL2____MV-LIST.html">mv-list</a> for a way to convert a multiple value into an ordinary 
 list.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 does not support the Common Lisp construct <span class="v">values</span>, whose logical 
 meaning seems difficult to characterize.  <span class="v">Mv</span> is the ACL2 analogue of that 
 construct.</p>
