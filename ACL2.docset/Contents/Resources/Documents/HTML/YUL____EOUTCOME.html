</dl><p>According to [Yul: Specification of Yul: Formal Specification], 
     the execution of an expression results in 
     not only zero of more values, 
     but also possibly updated global and local states. 
     [Yul: Specification of Yul: Formal Specification] 
     does not have an explicit name for this notion, 
     which in our formalization consists of 
     a computation state and a list of values. 
     We call this an expression outcome.</p>
