<p>Control printing from the garbage collector</p><pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____GC-VERBOSE.html">gc-verbose</a> arg &amp;optional arg2)</pre> 
 
 <p>Garbage collection (gc) is performed by every Lisp implementation; see 
 <a href="ACL2____GC_42.html">gc$</a>.  However, different ACL2 builds might see more or fewer messages. 
 This macro is intended to provide an interface for controlling the verbosity, 
 which is off if the (first) argument evaluates to <span class="v">nil</span> and otherwise is 
 on.  The second (optional) argument is currently ignored except when the host 
 Common Lisp implementation is CCL, where it specifies verbosity for EGC.</p> 
 
 <p>The above functionality is only supported for the following host Common 
 Lisp implementations: CCL, CMUCL, and GCL.  Otherwise, the only effect of this 
 macro is to print a notice that it is not supported.  You are welcome to 
 contact the ACL2 developers if you would like to help in adding such support 
 for another host Common Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>Evaluation of a call of this macro always returns <span class="v">nil</span>.</p>
