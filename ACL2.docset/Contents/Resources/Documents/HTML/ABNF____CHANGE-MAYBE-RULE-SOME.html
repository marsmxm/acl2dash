                <p>We construct a new <a href="ABNF____MAYBE-RULE-SOME.html">maybe-rule-some</a> structure that is a copy of 
                <span class="v">x</span>, except that you can explicitly change some particular 
                fields.  Any fields you don't mention just keep their values 
                from <span class="v">x</span>.</p>
