<p>Motivation for using a four-valued logic.</p><p>Why use a four-valued logic instead of a simple, two-valued, 
Boolean logic with just T and F?</p> 
 
<p>Having an X value is fundamental to the semantics of <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>, our 
circuit evaluator.  Loosely speaking, when we begin simulating a circuit, all 
of the internal wires are given X as their value.  We then evaluate all of the 
submodule occurrences.  Because of <a href="ACL2____4V-MONOTONICITY.html">monotonicity</a>, these evaluations can only change wires 
from X to a different value.  This puts a bound on the maximum number of 
evaluation steps required for the circuit's wires to reach a fixed point.</p> 
 
<p>In the context of symbolic simulation, X values are sometimes also useful as 
a way to ignore certain signals.  For instance, if we think some inputs to a 
particular circuit are not even involved in the property we wish to prove, we 
may leave them as X.</p> 
 
<p>X values also allow us to model some circuits which cannot be expressed with 
just Boolean logic.  For instance, imagine a scenario like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">      Diagram                      Verilog
       ____
      |    \                    assign C = ~A;
A  ---|     o------+            assign C = ~B;
      |____/       |
       ____        |-- C
      |    \       |
B  ---|     o------+
      |____/</pre> 
 
<p>Here the wire C is being driven by two separate sources.  When these sources 
have different values, e.g., suppose A is T and B is F, then C is 
simultaneously driven to both F and T.  We do not know which value will 
"win," or, really, whether there will even be a winner.  So in this case we 
just say the value of C is X.  Without an X value, we would not be able to 
model this circuit.</p> 
 
<p>The Z value allows us to model additional circuits, even beyond those 
circuits that are possible to model using Xes.  In the circuit above, we did 
not need a Z value because not-gates always drive at least some value onto C. 
But other kinds of circuits do not necessarily drive their output.  For 
instance, in Verilog one might describe a mux whose selects must be one-hot as 
follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign C = S1 ? A : 1'bz;
assign C = S2 ? B : 1'bz;
...</pre> 
 
<p>By adopting Z into our logic, we can model these kinds of assignments 
directly, e.g., see <a href="ACL2____4V-TRISTATE.html">4v-tristate</a> and <a href="ACL2____4V-RES.html">4v-res</a>.</p>
