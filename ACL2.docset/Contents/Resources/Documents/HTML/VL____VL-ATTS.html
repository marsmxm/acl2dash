<p>Representation of <span class="tt">(* foo = 3, bar *)</span> style attributes.</p><p>Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 allow many constructs, (e.g., 
           module instances, wire declarations, assignments, subexpressions, 
           and so on) to be annotated with <b>attributes</b>.</p> 
 
           <p>Each individual attribute can either be a single key with no 
           value (e.g., <span class="v">baz</span> above), or can have the form <span class="v">key = value</span>. 
           The keys are always identifiers, and the values (if provided) are 
           expressions.  Both Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 agree that an 
           attribute with no explicit value is to be treated as having value 
           <span class="v">1</span>.</p> 
 
 
           <h3>Representation</h3> 
 
           <p>We represent attributes as alists mapping names to their values. 
           We use ordinary ACL2 strings to represent the keys.  These strings 
           are typically honsed to improve memory sharing.  Each explicit value 
           is represented by an ordinary <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-P.html">vl-expr-p</a>, and keys with no 
           values are bound to <span class="v">nil</span> instead.</p>

           <h3>Size/Types of Attribute Values</h3> 
 
           <p>Verilog-2005 doesn't say anything about the types of attribute 
           expressions.  SystemVerilog-2012 says (Section 5.12) that the type 
           of an attribute with no value is <span class="v">bit</span>, and that otherwise its 
           type is the (presumably self-determined) type of the expression. 
           But this is not really an adequate spec.  Consider for instance an 
           attribute like:</p> 
 
           <pre class="code">(* foo = a + b *) 
           </pre> 
 
           <p>Since attributes live in their own namespace, it isn't clear what 
           <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">b</span> refer to here.  For instance, are they wires in 
           this module, or perhaps global values that are known by the Verilog 
           tool.  It doesn't seem at all clear what the type or size of such an 
           expression is supposed to be.</p> 
 
           <p>Well, no matter.  Attributes are not used for much and if their 
           sizes and types aren't well specified, that's not necessarily any 
           kind of problem.  We generally expect to be able to ignore 
           attributes and do not expect to need to size them or determine their 
           types.</p> 
 
 
           <h3>Nesting Attributes</h3> 
 
           <p>Note that both Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 prohibit the 
           nesting of attributes.  That is, expressions like the following are 
           not allowed:</p> 
 
           <pre class="code">(* foo = a + (* bar *) b *) 
           </pre> 
 
           <p>VL's parser enforces this restriction and will not allow 
           expressions to have nested attributes; see <a href="VL____VL-PARSE-0_B2-ATTRIBUTE-INSTANCES.html">vl-parse-0+-attribute-instances</a>.  However, we make <b>no such 
           restriction</b> internallyâ€”our <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-P.html">vl-expr-p</a> structures can 
           have attributes nested to any arbitrary depth.</p> 
 
 
           <h3>Redundant and Conflicting Attributes</h3> 
 
           <p>When the same attribute name is given repeatedly, both 
           Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 agree that the last occurrences 
           of the attribute should be used.  That is, the value of <span class="v">foo</span> 
           below should be 5:</p> 
 
           <pre class="code">(* foo = 1, foo = 5 *) 
assign w = a + b; 
           </pre> 
 
           <p>VL's parser properly handles this case.  It issues warnings when 
           duplicate attributes are used, and always produces <span class="v">vl-atts-p</span> 
           structures that are free from duplicate keys, and where the entry 
           for each attribute corresponds to the last occurrence of it; see 
           <a href="VL____VL-PARSE-0_B2-ATTRIBUTE-INSTANCES.html">vl-parse-0+-attribute-instances</a>.</p> 
 
           <p>Internally we make <b>no such restriction</b>.  We treat 
           <span class="v">vl-atts-p</span> structures as ordinary alists.</p> 
 
 
           <h3>Internal Use of Attributes by VL</h3> 
 
           <p>Certain VL transformations may occasionally add attributes 
           throughout modules.  For instance, the <a href="VL____MAKE-IMPLICIT-WIRES.html">make-implicit-wires</a> 
           transformation will add <span class="v">VL_IMPLICIT</span> attributes to the wire 
           declarations that added implicitly.</p> 
 
           <p>We once tried to record the different kinds of attributes that VL 
           used here, but that list became quickly out of date as we forgot to 
           maintain it, so we no longer try to do this.  As a general rule, 
           attributes added by VL <i>should</i> be prefixed with <span class="v">VL_</span>.  In 
           practice, we may sometimes forget to follow this rule.</p>
