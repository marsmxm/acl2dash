<p>Semantics of ABNF.</p><p>The abstract syntactic entities of ABNF 
     denote tree structures built by expanding the rules. 
     When all the rule names are expanded, 
     the leaves of the tree form a sequence of terminal values, 
     for which the tree is a parse tree.</p><p>These concepts are analogous to the ones 
     for the typical notion of formal grammar in textbooks, 
     but because ABNF is more complex, its semantics are more complex.</p>
