<p>Finding various structures within rule lists.</p><p>Some rules or groups of rules can be used to help automate defining 
     an abstract syntax corresponding to the concrete syntax defined in 
     a grammar.</p><p>We begin by observing that if there is only one rule for a given 
     rulename, and if the right hand side is a simple alternation of 
     rulenames, then the rule names could correspond to a type/subtype 
     relationship.  This relationship can be used to help generate 
     an abstract syntax model of the language, and to help simplify 
     code that processes values of the abstract syntax.</p>
