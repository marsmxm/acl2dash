<p>An indication of an integer expression's signedness (signed or 
          unsigned).</p><p>On the surface there is not much to this: a literal, wire, or some 
         other kind of expression might be regarded as either signed or 
         unsigned.  These notes about the signedness of things occur in the 
         representation of certain expressions like <a href="VL____VL-CONSTINT.html">vl-constint</a> and 
         <a href="VL____VL-WEIRDINT.html">vl-weirdint</a> literals.  There is some special handling for the 
         signedness of ports; see <a href="VL____PORTDECL-SIGN.html">portdecl-sign</a>, but signedness is most 
         critically used in <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-TYPEDECIDE.html">vl-expr-typedecide</a>.</p> 
 
         <p>Note about the word ``<b>type</b>.''  The Verilog-2005 and 
         SystemVerilog-2012 standards sometimes use the word ``type'' to refer 
         to the signedness of things.  Back in Verilog-2005 there were no fancy 
         types like structs and unions and the ``type'' of an expression 
         generally meant whether it was a real number, a signed integer, an 
         unsigned integer, and maybe other vaguely specified things.</p> 
 
         <p>With SystemVerilog-2012 adding much richer variable datatypes (see 
         <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE.html">vl-datatype</a>), it gets very confusing to use the word ``type'' 
         in place of signedness.  However, this is still done occasionally. 
         Most notably, it happens in SystemVerilog-2012 Section 11.8.1, which 
         is adapted from Verilog-2005's Section 5.5.1.  This section explains 
         how to compute the ``type'' of an expression, but in this context 
         ``type'' still means signedness and has little to do with any kind of 
         fancy SystemVerilog <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE.html">vl-datatype</a>-like types.</p> 
 
         <p>The signedness of wires and variables in VL is now generally part 
         of their <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE.html">vl-datatype</a>.  Historically the way to query a type for 
         its signedness was to use <span class="v">vl-datatype-signedness</span>.  More recently, 
         in order to add at least some support for non-integer expressions like 
         <span class="v">real</span> and <span class="v">shortreal</span>s, the signedness of a datatype has been 
         folded into the more general notion of its <span class="v">arithclass</span>.  See in 
         particular <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE-ARITHCLASS.html">vl-datatype-arithclass</a>.</p>
