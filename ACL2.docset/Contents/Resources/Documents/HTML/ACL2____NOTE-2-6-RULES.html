<p>ACL2 Version  2.6 Notes on Changes in Rules and Constants</p><p>The following symbols have been added to the list constant 
 <span class="v">*common-lisp-specials-and-constants*</span>: <span class="v">REPLACE</span>, <span class="v">FILL</span>, 
 <span class="v">CHARACTER</span>, <span class="v">=</span>, <span class="v">BREAK</span>, and <span class="v">PRIN1</span>.  This was done in support 
 of ports to Allegro 6.0 and Windows platforms (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-6-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-6-new-functionality</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>The list of symbols in <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span> has been modified, for example 
 to include <span class="v">show-accumulated-persistence</span> and the legal arguments to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ZIP.html">zip</a></span> are now handled slightly differently. 
 They are are now disabled, but each comes with a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule 
 that allows their expansion on non-variable terms, and also with a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a></span> rule that avoids the need for opening up 
 these functions when applied to variables.  The resulting behavior should be 
 very similar to the behavior of previous versions, except that case splits 
 will be avoided when these functions are applied to variables.</p> 
 
 <p>Function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-STRING-ALISTP.html">standard-string-alistp</a></span> replaces function 
 <span class="v">string-alistp</span>.  For further discussion, see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-6-GUARDS.html">note-2-6-guards</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> whose conclusion is a term of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> lhs rhs)</span> have always been stored in the expected way: <span class="v">lhs</span> 
 rewrites to <span class="v">rhs</span>.  This way of storing <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rules has been 
 extended to allow <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span> in place of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Rewrite rule <span class="v">nth-update-nth</span>, in source file <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span>, has been 
 strengthened.</p> 
 
 <p>A new rewrite rule <span class="v">equal-constant-+</span> has been added to the book 
 <span class="v">arithmetic/equalities</span>.  This should generally be a beneficial change, but 
 existing proofs involving the arithmetic books could conceivably be 
 affected.</p> 
 
 <p>Function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> and constant 
 <span class="v">*main-lisp-package-name*</span> have undergone small changes.  This change 
 should rarely be noticed by users and is discussed elsewhere; see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-6-SYSTEM.html">note-2-6-system</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We mention here that proofs involving <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s may need to be modified 
 because of changes in auxiliary functions generated by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span>. 
 (These changes were made in support of a new resizing capability, mentioned 
 elsewhere in these release notes; see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-6-NEW-FUNCTIONALITY.html">note-2-6-new-functionality</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>In the distributed book directory <span class="v">books/arithmetic/</span>, the book 
 <span class="v">rationals-with-axioms-proved.lisp</span> has been renamed 
 <span class="v">rationals.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>(ACL2(r) only) Rewrite rules <span class="v">realp-+</span>, <span class="v">realp-*</span>, 
 <span class="v">realp-unary--</span>, and <span class="v">realp-unary-/</span> have been added in analogy to 
 existing rules <span class="v">rationalp-+</span>, <span class="v">rationalp-*</span>, <span class="v">rationalp-unary--</span>, and 
 <span class="v">rationalp-unary-/</span>.  Thanks to Jun Sawada for suggesting this change.</p> 
 
 <p>The definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____AREF1.html">aref1</a></span> has been modified slightly.  Previously, if 
 <span class="v">*my-a*</span> were an array then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____AREF1.html">aref1</a> 'some-name *my-a* :header)</span> would 
 evaluate to the <span class="v">cdr</span> of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HEADER.html">header</a></span> of <span class="v">*my-a*</span> rather than to 
 its <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAULT.html">default</a></span>.  See <a href="ACL2____ARRAYS.html">arrays</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Changes have been made in the <span class="v">ihs</span> books, based on suggestions from Jun 
 Sawada, that support its use with ACL2(r) (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>).  The primary 
 change is to replace calls of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a></span> with calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REAL_F2RATIONALP.html">real/rationalp</a></span>, which should have no effect on users of standard ACL2.</p>
