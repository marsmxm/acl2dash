<p>Representation of an immediate assertion.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name — <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>The label for this assertion, if provided.  Note that in a 
                  statement context, labels like <span class="v">foo : assert ...</span>  mainly 
                  get turned into named <span class="v">begin/end</span> blocks, but we do take 
                  care to also put the name into the assertion object.</dd> 
 
<dt>type — <a href="VL____VL-ASSERTTYPE-P.html">vl-asserttype-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The type of this assertion, e.g., <span class="v">assert</span>, <span class="v">assume</span>, 
                  etc.</dd> 
 
<dt>deferral — <a href="VL____VL-ASSERTDEFERRAL-P.html">vl-assertdeferral-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Indicates whether this assertion is a regular, non-deferred 
                  assertion, or a #('#0') or <span class="v">final</span> deferred assertion.</dd> 
 
<dt>condition — <a href="VL____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The condition to assert.  Note that since this is an 
                  immediate assertion, the condition is a simple expression, 
                  not a fancy sequence or property.</dd> 
 
<dt>success — <a href="VL____VL-STMT.html">vl-stmt</a>
</dt> 
<dd>For most assertions, this is the success statement for the 
                  associated action block, or a <a href="VL____VL-NULLSTMT.html">vl-nullstmt</a> if there is 
                  no success statement.  Note that <span class="v">cover</span> assertions are 
                  special and don't have an action block, so for a <span class="v">cover</span> 
                  assertion this is just the associated statement, if any.</dd> 
 
<dt>failure — <a href="VL____VL-STMT.html">vl-stmt</a>
</dt> 
<dd>This is the <span class="v">else</span> statement from the action block, or a 
                  <a href="VL____VL-NULLSTMT.html">vl-nullstmt</a> if there is no <span class="v">else</span> statement.  For 
                  <span class="v">cover</span> assertions this is always just a <a href="VL____VL-NULLSTMT.html">vl-nullstmt</a> since there is no <span class="v">else</span> action.</dd> 
 
<dt>loc — <a href="VL____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Location of this statement in the source code.</dd>
