<p>Set the <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">case-split-limitations</a></p><p>Also see <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">case-split-limitations</a> for an example of how this 
 utility inhibits case splitting.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a> '(500 100))
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a> 'nil)
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a> '(500 nil))</pre> 
 
 <p>The first of these prevents <span class="v">clausify</span> from trying the 
 subsumption/replacement (see below) loop if more than 500 clauses are 
 involved.  It also discourages the clause simplifier from splitting into more 
 than 100 cases at once.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> 
 but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded. 
 Moreover, its effect is to set the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, and hence its 
 effect is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to the book or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form containing it; 
 see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> for discussion of a related hint, 
 <span class="v">:case-split-limitations</span>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____SPLITTER.html">splitter</a> for information about 
 reports on rules that may be responsible for case splits.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a> lst)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">lst</span> is either <span class="v">nil</span> (denoting a list of two <span class="v">nil</span>s), or a 
 list of length two, each element of which is either <span class="v">nil</span> or a natural 
 number.  When <span class="v">nil</span> is used as an element, it is treated as positive 
 infinity.  The default setting is <span class="v">(500 100)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The first number specifies the maximum number of clauses that may 
 participate in the ``subsumption/replacement'' loop.  Because of the expensive 
 nature of that loop (which compares every clause to every other in a way that 
 is quadratic in the number of literals in the clauses), when the number of 
 clauses exceeds about 1000, the system tends to ``go into a black hole,'' 
 printing nothing and not even doing many garbage collections (because the 
 subsumption/replacement loop does not create new clauses so much as it just 
 tries to delete old ones).  The initial setting is lower than the threshold at 
 which we see noticeably bad performance, so you probably will not see this 
 behavior unless you have raised or disabled the limit.</p> 
 
 <p>Why raise the subsumption/replacement limit?  The subsumption/replacement 
 loop cleans up the set of subgoals produced by the simplifier.  For example, 
 if one subgoal is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> p q r) s)            [1]</pre> 
 
 <p>and another is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> p (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> q) r) s)      [2]</pre> 
 
 <p>then the subsumption/replacement loop would produce the single subgoal</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> p r) s)              [3]</pre> 
 
 <p>instead.  This cleanup process is simply skipped when the number of 
 subgoals exceeds the subsumption/replacement limit.  But each subgoal must 
 nonetheless be proved.  The proofs of [1] and [2] are likely to duplicate much 
 work, which is only done once in proving [3].  So with a low limit, you may 
 find the system quickly produces a set of subgoals but then takes a long time 
 to prove that set.  With a higher limit, you may find the set of subgoals to 
 be ``cleaner'' and faster to prove.</p> 
 
 <p>Why lower the subsumption/replacement limit?  If you see the system go into 
 a ``black hole'' of the sort described above (no output, and few garbage 
 collections), it could due to the subsumption/replacement loop working on a 
 large set of large subgoals.  You might temporarily lower the limit so that it 
 begins to print the uncleaned set of subgoals.  Perhaps by looking at the 
 output you will realize that some function can be disabled so as to prevent 
 the case explosion.  Then raise or disable the limit again!</p> 
 
 <p>The second number in the case-split-limitations specifies how many case 
 splits the simplifier will allow before it begins to shut down case splitting. 
 In normal operation, when a literal rewrites to a nest of <span class="v">IF</span>s, the system 
 simplifies all subsequent literals in all the contexts generated by walking 
 through the nest in all possible ways.  This can also cause the system to ``go 
 into a black hole'' printing nothing except garbage collection messages.  This 
 ``black hole'' behavior is different from than mentioned above because space 
 is typically being consumed at a prodigious rate, since the system is 
 rewriting the literals over and over in many different contexts.</p> 
 
 <p>As the simplifier sweeps across the clause, it keeps track of the number of 
 cases that have been generated.  When that number exceeds the second number in 
 case-split-limitations, the simplifier stops rewriting literals.  The 
 remaining, unrewritten, literals are copied over into the output clauses. 
 <span class="v">IF</span>s in those literals are split out, but the literals themselves are not 
 rewritten.  Each output clause is then attacked again, by subsequent 
 simplification, and eventually the unrewritten literals in the tail of the 
 clause will be rewritten because the earlier literals will stabilize and stop 
 producing case splits.</p> 
 
 <p>The default setting of 100 is fairly low.  We have seen successful proofs 
 in which thousands of subgoals were created by a simplification.  By setting 
 the second number to small values, you can force the system to case split 
 slowly.  For example, a setting of 5 will cause it to generate ``about 5'' 
 subgoals per simplification.</p> 
 
 <p>You can read about how the simplifier works in the book Computer-Aided 
 Reasoning: An Approach (Kaufmann, Manolios, Moore); also see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> for a detailed tutorial on using the ACL2 
 prover.  If you think about it, you will see that with a low case limit, the 
 initial literals of a goal are repeatedly simplified, because each time a 
 subgoal is simplified we start at the left-most subterm.  So when case 
 splitting prevents the later subterms from being fully split out, we revisit 
 the earlier terms before getting to the later ones.  This can be good. 
 Perhaps it takes several rounds of rewriting before the earlier terms are in 
 normal form and then the later terms rewrite quickly.  But it could happen 
 that the earlier terms are expensive to rewrite and do not change, making the 
 strategy of delayed case splits less efficient.  It is up to you.</p> 
 
 <p>Sometimes the simplifier produces more clauses than you might expect, even 
 with case-split-limitations in effect.  As noted above, once the limit has 
 been exceeded, the simplifier does not rewrite subsequent literals.  But 
 <span class="v">IF</span>s in those literals are split out nonetheless.  Furthermore, the 
 enforcement of the limit is  as described above  all or nothing: 
 if the limit allows us to rewrite a literal then we rewrite the literal fully, 
 without regard for limitations, and get as many cases as ``naturally'' are 
 produced.  It quite often happens that a single literal, when expanded, may 
 grossly exceed the specified limits.</p> 
 
 <p>If the second ``number'' is <span class="v">nil</span> and the simplifier is going to produce 
 more than 1000 clauses, a ``helpful little message'' to this effect is printed 
 out.  This output is printed to the system's ``comment window'' not the 
 standard proofs output.</p>
