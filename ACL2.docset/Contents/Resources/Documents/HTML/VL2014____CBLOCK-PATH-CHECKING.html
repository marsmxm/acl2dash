<p>How we check whether all of the variables assigned to in an always 
block are, indeed, assigned to in all paths.  In other words: how we know that 
we don't need to infer a latch.</p><p>This is a basic criteria for whether we can treat an always block 
as combinational.  Some examples of what we want to accept and reject:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a>)                        &lt;---- OK, combinational block because
  if (c1) lhs = rhs1;                    LHS is assigned in every branch.
  else lhs = rhs2;

always @(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a>)                        &lt;---- NOT OK, need to infer a latch
  if (c1) lhs = rhs;                     because LHS must hold its value
                                         when C1 is false.

always @(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a>)                        &lt;---- OK, combinational block because
  lhs = rhs1;                            LHS is assigned in every branch.
  if (c1) lhs = rhs2;</pre> 
 
<p>Our implementation is brain-dead simple: we write a function that checks 
whether a particular LHS is assigned in every branch.  Then we'll apply that 
function to every LHS that is used anywhere in the block.</p> 
 
<p>This approach fails to identify "arguably" combinational always blocks 
such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a>)
  if (c1) lhs = rhs1;
  if (!c1) lhs = rhs2;</pre> 
 
<p>because our path exploration function stupidly does not consider the 
possible relationships between the conditions.</p> 
 
<p>Well, it's not clear that we <i>should</i> try to do anything smarter than 
this.  After all, synthesis tools might not do hard work here, either.</p>
