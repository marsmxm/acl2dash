<p>Mark a book as incompatible with ACL2(p) waterfall parallelism.</p><p>Some features of ACL2 are incompatible with ACL2(p); see <a href="ACL2____UNSUPPORTED-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM-FEATURES.html">unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features</a>.  For example, ACL2(p) does not 
 support <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>s that modify the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NON-PARALLEL-BOOK.html">non-parallel-book</a>)</span> instructs ACL2 to ensure that <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">waterfall-parallelism</a> is turned off.  When you put that form into a book, it 
 will be ignored when including the book unless keyword <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> 
 is true.  (Suggestion: avoid that keyword unless you are sure you know what 
 you are doing!)</p>
