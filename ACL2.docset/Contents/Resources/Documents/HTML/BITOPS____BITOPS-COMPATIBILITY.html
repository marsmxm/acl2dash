<p>Notes about using Bitops with other arithmetic libraries.</p><p>Bitops can work well with many other arithmetic libraries.  Here we 
briefly sketch some tips about using various libraries with Bitops.</p> 
 
 
<h3>ihs/</h3> 
 
<p>Bitops started as an extension to the ihs library.  Because of this 
heritage, the relationship between <span class="v">ihs/</span> and <span class="v">bitops/</span> is somewhat 
complex.  Some parts of <span class="v">ihs</span> can still be used with Bitops, others are best 
avoided.</p> 
 
<h5>IHS Definition Books</h5> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">ihs/basic-definitions</span> book is included directly in Bitops.  You may 
often want to non-locally include this book (to get definitions such as 
<span class="v">loghead</span> and <span class="v">logtail</span>), then locally include Bitops books such as 
<span class="v">ihsext-basics</span> (to get the lemmas).</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">basic-definitions</span> book wasn't always part of ihs.  We created it by 
extracting "the good parts" of the richer <span class="v">ihs/logops-definitions</span> book. 
We typically do <b>not</b> load the additional definitions and macros that 
remain in <span class="v">ihs/logops-definitions</span>, or the <span class="v">@logops</span> book which defines 
various four-valued operations.  But if you have some particular reason to want 
these definitions, it would probably be fine to load them alongside Bitops.</p> 
 
<h5>IHS Lemma Books</h5> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">ihs/quotient-remainder-lemmas</span> book has lemmas about integer 
division operations like <a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____TRUNCATE.html">truncate</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____REM.html">rem</a>, 
etc.  This book generally works well with Bitops and may be a fine choice. 
Other options include <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span> and <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span>; see below.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">ihs/math-lemmas</span> book is an extremely minimal math library.  You 
should probably use a library like <span class="v">arithmetic/top</span> instead; see below.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">ihs/logops-lemmas</span> book is a key book for bit-vector reasoning in 
ihs.  But you should generally <b>not</b> use it when you are using Bitops, 
because the Bitops book <span class="v">ihsext-basics</span> supersedes itit imports the 
good rules and then introduces improved replacements for many of the 
<span class="v">ihsext-basics</span> rules.</p> 
 
 
<p>The <span class="v">ihs-lemmas</span> book is a wrapper that includes the other <span class="v">-lemmas</span> 
books; it probably is best to just load <span class="v">quotient-remainder-lemmas</span> instead, 
since you generally wouldn't want to use the other books with Bitops.</p> 
 
 
<h3><span class="v">arithmetic/</span></h3> 
 
<p>This is a very lightweight library that loads quickly and generally works 
well with Bitops.  It provides modest support for reasoning about how basic 
operations like <span class="v">&lt;</span>, <span class="v">+</span>, <span class="v">-</span>, <span class="v">*</span>, <span class="v">/</span> and <span class="v">expt</span> relate to 
one another over integers and rationals.</p> 
 
<p><b>1.</b> The book <span class="v">arithmetic/top</span> is generally a good starting point. 
It can effectively deal with simple terms like <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 -1 a)</span> and apply other 
obvious reductions.  This is a good book to use when your use of arithmetic is 
mostly incidental, e.g., you have a function that recurs by calling <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> n
1)</span> or similar.</p> 
 
<p><b>2.</b> The book <span class="v">arithmetic/top-with-meta</span> is only slightly stronger; 
it adds some <a href="ACL2____META.html">ACL2::meta</a> rules that can more effectively cancel out 
summands and factors that can arise in various equalities and inequalities. 
It's a fine choice that is about on par with <span class="v">arithmetic/top</span>, but which is 
superior in some cases.</p> 
 
 
<h3><span class="v">arithmetic-3/</span></h3> 
 
<p><b>1.</b> The basic <span class="v">arithmetic-3/bind-free/top</span> book is essentially 
similar to the <span class="v">arithmetic</span> library, but features a much more sophisticated 
use of meta rules for reducing sums and products, and recognizing when 
arithmetic expressions return integers.  It also features a much stronger 
integration with <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">ACL2::non-linear-arithmetic</a> reasoning, which may be 
especially useful when working with <span class="v">*</span> and <span class="v">/</span>.</p> 
 
<p>This book is also very compatible with Bitops and may be a good choice for 
cases where <span class="v">arithmetic/top-with-meta</span> is not doing a good enough job with 
respect to the basic arithmetic operations.  Just about the only issue is that 
it has some special support for <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 ...)</span> which overlaps a bit with 
Bitops rules about <span class="v">ash</span>.  But this is really pretty unlikely to cause you 
any problems.</p> 
 
<p>If your proofs involving large terms (e.g., you are doing proofs about 
machine models), you might want to start with <span class="v">arithmetic/top-with-meta</span> 
instead of <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span>, but only because <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span>'s more 
powerful rules are perhaps somewhat slowerit has a lot of <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">ACL2::type-prescription</a> rules, for instance, and these can sometimes get 
slow.</p> 
 
<p><b>2.</b> The <span class="v">arithmetic-3/floor-mod/floor-mod</span> book extends 
<span class="v">bind-free/top</span> with rules about <a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a>.  It also gets 
rid of <a href="COMMON-LISP____REM.html">rem</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____TRUNCATE.html">truncate</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____ROUND.html">round</a>, and <a href="COMMON-LISP____CEILING.html">ceiling</a> by 
rewriting them into <span class="v">floor</span> and <span class="v">mod</span> terms.</p> 
 
<p>Bitops has very little support for working with <span class="v">floor</span> and <span class="v">mod</span>, so 
all of this is generally compatible with Bitops <b>except for powers of 2</b>. 
In Bitops, we generally prefer to deal with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a> n x)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGTAIL.html">logtail</a>
n x)</span> instead of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a> x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n))</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a> x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n))</span>.  We 
also generally prefer <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____ASH.html">ash</a> 1 n)</span> over <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n)</span>, but this is more 
minor.</p> 
 
<p>At any rate, if you are dealing with something like <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a> x 3)</span>, or 
more generally with <span class="v">floor</span> or <span class="v">mod</span> by arbitrary moduli, then writing 
your goals in terms of <span class="v">floor</span> and <span class="v">mod</span> and using the <span class="v">floor-mod</span> 
book may be a fine choice.  But if you are dealing with powers of 2, it is 
probably generally best to avoid <span class="v">floor</span> and <span class="v">mod</span>, and phrase your goal 
using the bit-vector operations instead.</p> 
 
<p><b>3.</b> The <span class="v">arithmetic-3/extra/top-ext</span> book extends the 
<span class="v">floor-mod</span> book with additional lemmas about both the basic operators and 
about <span class="v">floor</span> and <span class="v">mod</span>. </p> 
 
<p>This is a bit heavier weight.  It adds build dependencies on 
<span class="v">arithmetic-2</span> and a (small) portion of the <span class="v">rtl</span> library, and may 
generally be a bit slower since, e.g., some of the rules it adds introduce 
additional case splits.  But while you may not want to try this book when 
dealing with very large terms, it is generally a good book to try when you need 
to prove a hard lemma involving lots of arithmetic.</p> 
 
 
<h3>arithmetic-5/</h3> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">arithmetic-5/top</span> book is a popular, quite heavy-weight book that 
is somewhat compatible with Bitops.</p> 
 
<p>We usually prefer not to use <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span>.  The library can sometimes 
be quite slow; many rules case split and there are, for instance, a great 
number of <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">ACL2::type-prescription</a> rules that can become very expensive 
in some cases.  For instance, an extreme case was <span class="v">lemma-4-1-30</span> from 
<span class="v">rtl/rel9/seed.lisp</span>we were able to speed this proof up from 651 
seconds to 1 second by mostly just disabling these type-prescription rules; see 
SVN revision 2160 for details.</p> 
 
<p>On the other hand, <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span> is a very sophisticated library that 
can deal with hard arithmetic problems, and now and again it can be useful to 
use it instead of other libraries.</p> 
 
<p>Combining <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span> with Bitops may sometimes be tricky.</p> 
 
<p>As with <span class="v">arithmetic-3/floor-mod</span>, you will want to watch out for powers 
of 2.  In Bitops we generally prefer to work with bit-vector functions like 
<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a>, <a href="ACL2____LOGTAIL.html">logtail</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____ASH.html">ash</a>, etc., instead of writing terms 
involving <a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a> terms by <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n)</span>.</p> 
 
<p>But unlike <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span>, <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span> has many rules about 
bit-vector functions such as <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGIOR.html">logior</a>, etc., and these 
rules may sometimes work against you.  For instance, rules like these are likely 
not what you want:</p> 
 
<p><b>Theorem: </b>(logand 1 x)</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> acl2::|(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a> 1 x)|
        (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> x)
                 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a> 1 x)
                        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EVENP.html">evenp</a> x) 0 1))))</pre> 
 
<p>And generally <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span> likes to reason about <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 1/2
x))</span> instead of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGCAR.html">logcar</a> x)</span>, which is messy because it introduces rational 
arithmetic into your problem.</p> 
 
<p>It's possible to overcome and work around these problems, but you may want 
to be looking out for these sorts of issues and making sure that you aren't 
being pulled toward competing normal forms.</p>
