<p>Milawa is a "self-verifying" theorem prover for an ACL2-like logic.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>We begin with a simple proof checker, call it A, which is short enough to 
verify by the "social process" of mathematicsâ€”and more recently with a 
theorem prover for a more expressive logic.</p> 
 
<p>We then develop a series of increasingly powerful proof checkers, call them 
B, C, D, and so on. We show each of these programs only accepts the same 
formulas as A, using A to verify B, and B to verify C, and so on. Then, since 
we trust A, and A says B is trustworthy, we can trust B. Then, since we trust 
B, and B says C is trustworthy, we can trust C. And so on for all the rest.  We 
call this process <i>bootstrapping</i>.</p> 
 
<p>Our final proof checker is really a theorem prover; it can carry out a 
goal-directed proof search using assumptions, calculation, rewrite rules, and 
so on.  We use this theorem prover to discover the bootstrapping proofs needed 
to verify B, and to emit these proofs in a format that A can check.  We then 
use it to discover the proof for C, and emit it in a format suitable for B, and 
so on.  In this way, Milawa discovers its own soundness proof, hence 
"self-verifying".</p> 
 
<p>Milawa was originally developed as part of <a href="https://www.kookamara.com/jared/" target="_blank"><nobr>Jared Davis'<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.kookamara.com/jared/"></nobr></a> 
Ph.D. dissertation, <a href="https://www.kookamara.com/jared/milawa/Documentation/dissertation.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>A 
self-verifying theorem prover.<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.kookamara.com/jared/milawa/Documentation/dissertation.pdf"></nobr></a>.  The dissertation covers the process 
described above, i.e., it explains how the question of trusting the prover's 
tactics may be reduced to that of trusting its kernel.  The kernel and its 
logical foundations are addressed informally but, at some level, its 
correctness is simply assumed.</p> 
 
<p>More recently, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>Magnus 
Myreen<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/index.html"></nobr></a> has applied ideas from his Ph.D. research to develop and formally 
verify <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/jitawa/" target="_blank"><nobr>Jitawa<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mom22/jitawa/"></nobr></a>, a Lisp 
runtime that is capable of running Milawa through its full bootstrapping 
process.  Going further, Magnus has developed a <a href="http://hol.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"><nobr>HOL4<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://hol.sourceforge.net/"></nobr></a>-checked proof showing that Milawa's 
kernel is sound when run on Jitawa.</p> 
 
<p>This HOL4 proof, combined with Milawa's kernel's processing of the 
bootstrapping proofs, yields an impressive result: it establishes the 
correctness of a heuristic, Boyer-Moore style theorem prover, all the way down 
to the x86 machine code that runs it.</p> 
 
<p>Milawa is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" target="_blank"><nobr>free 
software<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html"></nobr></a> released under an MIT/X11 style license.</p>
