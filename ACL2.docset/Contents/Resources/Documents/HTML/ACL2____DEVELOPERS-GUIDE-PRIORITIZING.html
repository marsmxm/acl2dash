<p>Prioritizing: When to Make Changes</p><p>It may be tempting to enhance ACL2 whenever an intriguing idea 
 comes along for making an improvement.  There is something to be said for 
 doing so: the immediate motivation may make the work fun and lead to good 
 results.</p> 
 
 <font color="#800080"> 
 <p>SUMMARY THAT SHOULD SUFFICE: Fix bugs, prioritize what will actually be 
 used, and beware of massive regression failures.  Changes can be extremely 
 valuable, and can also be substantially more work than predicted.</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <p>But there can be drawbacks to taking on every opportunity to make an 
 improvement.  Heuristic improvements can be very difficult to work out without 
 breaking, or slowing down, the regression suite.  A change may inadvertently 
 break something.  Changes may be much more time-consuming than expected, and 
 may take time away from other more important changes to be made.  Below we 
 explore some aspects of prioritizing development tasks.</p> 
 
 <h3>Bugs</h3> 
 
 <p>Bug fixes are generally a priority, especially (of course) if they impact 
 soundness.  Enough said?</p> 
 
 <h3>Accommodating user requests</h3> 
 
 <p>It has been observed that many ideas for improvements that may <i>seem</i> 
 helpful are actually <i>not</i> very helpful to anyone actually using ACL2. 
 It is therefore usually a good idea to prioritize changes that either 
 accommodate specific requests from a user, or at the least can be seen as 
 having significant positive impact on users.  It is very easy to think a new 
 feature will be useful, but with the result that it's rarely or ever used, yet 
 it complicates the source base.  A feature you consider might be close to 
 being useful, but by waiting for a specific request, you can perhaps get 
 substantially more insight about what would truly be useful, thus refining 
 your initial idea for that feature.</p> 
 
 <h3>Impacts on the regression suite</h3> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> provide a well-established set of 
 libraries, as well as a useful set of regression tests.  Changes to ACL2 may 
 cause some failures when certifying these books.  Often these are easy to fix, 
 for example by modifying <a href="ACL2____THEORY.html">theory</a> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> or by changing subgoal 
 names on hints.  Changes may also impact ACL2(p) or ACL2(r), which are 
 probably tested significantly less frequently.  More worrisome is the 
 potential impact on private repositories, for example proprietary (not public) 
 sets of books at companies.  There can also be slowdowns, which can be 
 debugged by running the tool <span class="v">compare.pl</span>; see the chapter, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-MAINTENANCE.html">developers-guide-maintenance</a>.  There is a balance, addressed by using 
 judgment, between introducing behavioral changes and maintaining the community 
 books and private repositories.  There needs to be a guess about whether the 
 benefit of the change outweighs the effort required to design and implement it 
 and the fallout of requiring changes to books.</p>
