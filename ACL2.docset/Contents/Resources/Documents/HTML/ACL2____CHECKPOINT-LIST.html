<p>Return prover key checkpoint clauses programmatically.</p><p>Recall the key checkpoints printed at the end of a failed proof 
 attempt.  Some are labeled ``Key checkpoint at the top level''; let us call 
 these checkpoints ``top-level'', and denote others as ``not top-level''.  When 
 the most recent proof attempt was one that failed, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-LIST.html">checkpoint-list</a> top-p
 state)</span> returns clauses corresponding to key checkpoints, as follows.  If 
 <span class="v">top-p</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, then the list of top-level checkpoints is returned. 
 Otherwise the list of checkpoints that are not top-level is returned.  In each 
 case, the order of checkpoints is the same as would be found in the summary of 
 a proof attempt; that is, their order agrees with the order in which they are 
 generated during the proof attempt.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Related tools.</b>  Note that each returned checkpoint is a clause, that 
 is, a list of <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>s, implicitly disjoined.  For a similar utility that 
 instead returns each checkpoint as an untranslated <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> such as one 
 would see during a proof, see <a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-LIST-PRETTY.html">checkpoint-list-pretty</a>.  See also <a href="ACL2____SHOW-CHECKPOINT-LIST.html">show-checkpoint-list</a> for a related tool that displays checkpoints rather than 
 returning them, and see <a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-INFO-LIST.html">checkpoint-info-list</a> for a tool similar to 
 <span class="v">checkpoint-list</span> that returns additional information.</p> 
 
 <p>Examples may be found in the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> file 
 <span class="v">checkpoints-tests-input.lsp</span>, with corresponding output (using the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RUN-SCRIPT.html">run-script</a></span> tool) in that same directory, in file 
 <span class="v">checkpoints-tests-log.txt</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here are details to keep in mind.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>A return value of <span class="v">:UNAVAILABLE</span> indicates that no information on 
 checkpoints is available, presumably because the most recent proof attempt 
 succeeded.</li> 
 
 <li>This utility produces the appropriate result even when inhibited 
 <span class="v">SUMMARY</span> output (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>) suppresses the 
 printing of key checkpoints in a proof attempt.</li> 
 
 <li>Each forcing round (see <a href="ACL2____FORCING-ROUND.html">forcing-round</a>) is considered a new proof 
 attempt for purposes of this tool.</li> 
 
 <li>Suppose a proof attempt is aborted in favor of proving the original goal 
 by induction, as typically indicated with the following prover output. 
 
 <pre class="code">We therefore abandon our previous work on this conjecture and
reassign the name *1 to the original conjecture.</pre> 
 
 In that case, the unique top-level checkpoint is <span class="v">(&lt;GOAL&gt;)</span>.  Moreover, all 
 information stored for the proof attempt is based on the part of the attempt 
 starting after returning to prove the original goal by induction; all 
 checkpoints produced before that happens will be lost.  If that isn't what you 
 want, consider using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The notion of ``most recent proof attempt'' includes proof attempts made 
 during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> expansion.</li> 
 
 </ul>
