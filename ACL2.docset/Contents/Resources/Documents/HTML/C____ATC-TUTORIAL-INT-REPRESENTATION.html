<p>ATC tutorial: ACL2 representation of the C <span class="v">int</span> type and operations.</p><p>As stated in <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-APPROACH.html">atc-tutorial-approach</a>, 
    ATC recognizes, and translates to C, 
    a subset of ACL2 that represents C code quite directly. 
    In other words, there are representations of C constructs in ACL2, 
    which the ATC user must know so that they can invoke ATC 
    on ACL2 code of the appropriate form. 
    This tutorial page describes how the C <span class="v">int</span> types and operations 
    are represented in ACL2; 
    examples of their use, and of C code generated from them, 
    are given in other pages.</p><h5>C <span class="v">int</span> Type and Operations</h5><p>According to [C:6.2.5/5] and [C:5.2.4.2.1/1], 
    the ``plain'' <span class="v">int</span> type consists of 
    signed integers in a range from -32767 or less to +32767 or more 
    (both numbers are inclusive). 
    The exact range depends on the C implementation, as detailed below.</p><p>The (C, not ACL2) representation of <span class="v">int</span> values in memory, 
    which may be visible to the C code via access as <span class="v">unsigned char[]</span> 
    (as allowed by [C]), 
    consists of a sign bit, some value bits, and optionally some padding bits 
    [C:6.2.6.2/2]. 
    The signed representation may be 
    two's complement, one's complement, or sign and magnitude 
    [C:6.2.6.2/2]. 
    All these choices are implementation-dependent, 
    and determine the range of <span class="v">int</span> values, 
    subject to the minimum range requirement stated above.</p><p>Two's complement representations without padding bits seem the most common, 
    along with 8-bit bytes 
    (the exact number of bits in a byte is also implementation-dependent 
    [C:5.2.4.2.1/1] [C:6.2.6.1/3]). 
    Under these assumptions, <span class="v">int</span> values must consist of at least 16 bits, 
    resulting in at least the range from -32768 to +32767. 
    [C:6.2.6.1/4] requires <span class="v">int</span> to take a whole number of bytes, 
    and thus the possible bit sizes are 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, etc. 
    [C:6.2.5/5] states that the size is 
    the natural one suggested by the architecture of the execution environment. 
    For modern Macs and PCs, experiments suggest this to be 32 bits 
    (the experiment consists in printing <span class="v">sizeof(int)</span> in a C program), 
    even though one might expect it to be 64 bits instead, 
    given that these are 64-bit machines with 64-bit operating systems. 
    (However, the C <span class="v">long</span> type appears to be 64 bits on these platforms.)</p><p>C provides a variety of <span class="v">int</span> operations, 
    i.e. operations on <span class="v">int</span> values. 
    These operations also apply to other arithmetic types, 
    but in this tutorial page we focus on the <span class="v">int</span> type.</p><p>C provides the following unary and binary <span class="v">int</span> operations [C:6.5]:</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="v">+</span> (unary) — no value change, but mirrors unary <span class="v">-</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">-</span> (unary) — arithmetic negation</li>
<li>
<span class="v">~</span> (unary) — bitwise complement</li>
<li>
<span class="v">!</span> (unary) — logical negation/complement</li>
<li>
<span class="v">+</span> (binary) — addition</li>
<li>
<span class="v">-</span> (binary) — subtraction</li>
<li>
<span class="v">*</span> (binary) — multiplication</li>
<li>
<span class="v">/</span> (binary) — division</li>
<li>
<span class="v">%</span> (binary) — remainder</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&lt;&lt;</span> (binary) — left shift</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&gt;&gt;</span> (binary) — right shift</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&lt;</span> (binary) — less-than</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&gt;</span> (binary) — greater-than</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&lt;=</span> (binary) — less-than-or-equal-to</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&gt;=</span> (binary) — greater-than-or-equal-to</li>
<li>
<span class="v">==</span> (binary) — equality</li>
<li>
<span class="v">!=</span> (binary) — non-equality</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;</span> (binary) — bitwise conjunction</li>
<li>
<span class="v">^</span> (binary) — bitwise exclusive disjunction</li>
<li>
<span class="v">|</span> (binary) — bitwise inclusive disjunction</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;&amp;</span> (binary) — logical (short-circuit) conjunction</li>
<li>
<span class="v">||</span> (binary) — logical (short-circuit) disjunction</li>
<li>
<span class="v">=</span> (binary) — simple assignment</li>
<li>
<span class="v">+=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">+</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">-=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">-</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">*=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">*</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">/=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">/</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">%=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">%</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&lt;&lt;=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">&lt;&lt;</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&gt;&gt;=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">&gt;&gt;</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">&amp;</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">^=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">^</span>
</li>
<li>
<span class="v">|=</span> (binary) — compound assignment with <span class="v">|</span>
</li>
</ul><p>These not only take, but also return, <span class="v">int</span> values. 
    This uniformity is also due to the fact that C represents booleans 
    as the <span class="v">int</span> values 0 (for false) and 1 (for true), 
    and thus the relational and equality operations, 
    as well as the logical conjunction and disjunction operations, 
    all return <span class="v">int</span> results [C:6.5.13] [C:6.5.14].</p><p>Some of the above operations yield well-defined results, 
    specified by [C], only under certain conditions. 
    For instance, the addition operation <span class="v">+</span> on <span class="v">int</span> operands 
    is well-defined only if the exact result is representable as an <span class="v">int</span> 
    [C:6.5/5]. 
    An implementation may actually add definedness to these operations, 
    by relying on the (well-defined) behavior of the underlying hardware, 
    e.g. by keeping the low bits of the exact result that fit <span class="v">int</span> 
    (which is the same result prescribed by the Java language specification).</p><p>The <span class="v">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="v">||</span> operations 
    are non-strict at the expression level: 
    their second operand expression is not executed 
    if the result of the first operand expression 
    suffices to determine the final result 
    (0 for conjunction, 1 for disjunction).</p><p>The simple and compound assignment operations have side effects. 
    All the other operations are pure, i.e. without side effect.</p><h5>ACL2 Representation</h5><p>The ACL2 representation of the C <span class="v">int</span> type and operations 
    is in the files <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/c/atc/integers.lisp</span> 
    and <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/c/atc/integer-operations.lisp</span>. 
    These are automatically included when ATC is included, 
    but one may want to include those file as part of an APT derivation 
    that refines some specification to the ACL2 subset handled by ATC 
    (see <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-APPROACH.html">atc-tutorial-approach</a>), 
    and thus before including ATC itself, 
    which is only needed to generate code at the end of the derivation.</p><p>In line with typical C implementations on Macs and PCs mentioned above, 
    our ACL2 representation of <span class="v">int</span> values 
    consists of signed two's complement 32-bit integers. 
    More precisely, we provide a fixtype <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT.html">sint</a></span> (for <span class="v">signed int</span>), 
    with associated predicate <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINTP.html">sintp</a></span> and fixer <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-FIX.html">sint-fix</a></span>. 
    This fixtype wraps 
    ACL2 integers in the range from -2^{31} to 2^{31}-1. 
    The wrapping provides more abstraction: 
    (the ACL2 representation of) C <span class="v">int</span> values must be manipulated 
    only via the provided ACL2 functions (see below) 
    in the ACL2 code that ATC translates to C.</p><p>We plan to generalize our ACL2 representation of C <span class="v">int</span> values 
    to allow different sizes than 4 (8-bit) bytes. 
    This will be achieved via a static parameterization, 
    i.e. via (something like) a constrained nullary function 
    that specifies the size of <span class="v">int</span>. 
    We may also further generalize the representation, 
    again via a static parameterization, 
    to cover more of the options allowed by [C].</p><p>We also provide ACL2 functions 
    corresponding to some of the operations listed above:</p><ul>

</li>
</ul><p>These are all the strict pure operations; 
    the non-strict or non-pure operations are excluded, 
    because they are represented differently in ACL2, 
    as described elsewhere in this tutorial.</p><p>These ACL2 functions take <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT.html">sint</a></span> values as inputs, 
    as required by their guards. 
    They also return <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT.html">sint</a></span> values as outputs, 
    as proved by their return type theorems.</p><p>Some of these functions have additional guard conditions 
    that capture the conditions under which 
    the result is well-defined according to the [C]. 
    For instance, the guard of <span class="tt"><a href="C____ADD-SINT-SINT.html">add-sint-sint</a></span> includes the condition that 
    the exact integer result fits in the range of the ACL2 integers 
    that are wrapped to form <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT.html">sint</a></span> values. 
    More precisely, these additional guard conditions 
    are captured by the following predicates, 
    whose association to the above functions should be obvious from the names:</p><ul>
<li><span class="tt"><a href="C____MINUS-SINT-OKP.html">minus-sint-okp</a></span></li>
<li><span class="tt"><a href="C____ADD-SINT-SINT-OKP.html">add-sint-sint-okp</a></span></li>

<li><span class="tt"><a href="C____MUL-SINT-SINT-OKP.html">mul-sint-sint-okp</a></span></li>
<li><span class="tt"><a href="C____DIV-SINT-SINT-OKP.html">div-sint-sint-okp</a></span></li>
<li><span class="tt"><a href="C____REM-SINT-SINT-OKP.html">rem-sint-sint-okp</a></span></li>
<li><span class="tt"><a href="C____SHL-SINT-SINT-OKP.html">shl-sint-sint-okp</a></span></li>
<li><span class="tt"><a href="C____SHR-SINT-SINT-OKP.html">shr-sint-sint-okp</a></span></li>
</ul><p>The predicates for <span class="v">/</span> and <span class="v">%</span> include 
    the condition that the divisor is not 0.</p><p>Besides unary and binary <span class="v">int</span> operations, 
    C includes <span class="v">int</span> constants [C:6.4.4.1] 
    (more precisely, integer constants, some of which have type <span class="v">int</span>), 
    which may be regarded as (a large number of nullary) <span class="v">int</span> operations. 
    Our ACL2 representation in <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/c/atc/integers.lisp</span> 
    provides functions 
    <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-DEC-CONST.html">sint-dec-const</a></span>, 
    <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-OCT-CONST.html">sint-oct-const</a></span>, and 
    <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-HEX-CONST.html">sint-hex-const</a></span> 
    whose calls on suitable ACL2 quoted integer constants 
    represent decimal, octal, and hexadecimal <span class="v">int</span> constants. 
    The quoted integer constant arguments must be 
    natural numbers in the range of signed two's complement 32-bit integers: 
    this is enforced by the guard of the three aforementioned functions. 
    Note that C integer constants are always non-negative.</p><p>See the documentation of the fixtype and functions mentioned above 
    for more details.</p><p>In the future, we may generalize our representation of these operations 
    to allow for implementation-defined behaviors, 
    via suitable static parameterizations.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Previous:</b> <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-PROOFS.html">ACL2 Proofs Generated for the Generated C code</a></p><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-INT-PROGRAMS.html">ACL2 representation and generation of C <span class="v">int</span> programs</a></p>
