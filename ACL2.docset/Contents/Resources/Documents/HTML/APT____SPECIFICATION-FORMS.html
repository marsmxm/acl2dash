<p>Forms of specifications handled by certain APT transformations.</p><p>Certain APT transformations operate on specifications 
     that are shallow pop-refinement predicates 
     as described in the `Specifications and Refinements' <a href="res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>design notes<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf"></nobr></a>, which use <a href="res/kestrel-design-notes/notation.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>this notation<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-design-notes/notation.pdf"></nobr></a>. Currently these second-order predicates 
     must be expressed using <a href="SOFT____SOFT.html">SOFT</a>. 
     In the future, the transformations may be extended 
     to operate on second-order predicates 
     expressed using the built-in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>.</p><p>In this manual page, 
     we define and name certain specific forms of such SOFT specifications. 
     In the `Specifications and Refinements' <a href="res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>design notes<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf"></nobr></a>, these forms are shown 
     in Section `Some Shallow Pop-Refinement Specification Forms'. 
     APT transformations that operate on these forms 
     reference this manual page from their user documentation pages, 
     along with a designation of the form.</p><h3>Pre/Post-Condition</h3><p>This form is denoted by PP in the `Specifications and Refinements' <a href="res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>design notes<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf"></nobr></a>.</p><p>A specification of this form is a SOFT quantifier function 
     (see `Classification' section in <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFSOFT.html">soft::defsoft</a></span>) 
     that has no parameters, 
     that depends on one function variable (call it <span class="v">?f</span>), 
     and whose body has the form</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (x1 ... xn)
        (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (pre x1 ... xn)
                 (post x1 ... xn (?f x1 ... xn))))</pre><p>where <span class="v">n</span> is 1 or more, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> may be <span class="v">impliez</span> instead, 
     <span class="v">pre</span> is a precondition predicate, and 
     <span class="v">post</span> is a postcondition predicate. 
     Note that <span class="v">?f</span> returns a single result (not <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span>), 
     because SOFT function variables currently always do.</p><p>This is a typical specification consisting of 
     a precondition on the inputs and 
     a postcondition on the output (and inputs).</p><p>In the `Specifications and Refinements' <a href="res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>design notes<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf"></nobr></a>, 
     the specification is denoted by S, 
     <span class="v">?f</span> is denoted by f, 
     <span class="v">x1</span>, ..., <span class="v">xn</span> are denoted by a single x 
     (the generalization to multiple variable is obvious), 
     <span class="v">pre</span> is denoted by \Phi, and 
     <span class="v">post</span> is denoted by \Psi.</p><h3>Input/Output Relation</h3><p>This form is denoted by Rf in the `Specifications and Refinements' <a href="res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>design notes<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf"></nobr></a>.</p><p>A specification of this form is a SOFT quantifier function 
     (see `Classification' section in <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFSOFT.html">soft::defsoft</a></span>) 
     that has no parameters, 
     that depends on one function variable (call it <span class="v">?f</span>), 
     and whose body has the form</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (x1 ... xn)
        iorel&lt;x1,...,xn,(?f x1 ... xn)&gt;)</pre><p>where <span class="v">n</span> is 1 or more, 
     <span class="v">iorel&lt;...&gt;</span> is a term that depends on the quantified variables 
     and that contains a single occurrence of 
     a call of <span class="v">?f</span> on the quantified variables.</p><p>The predicate <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x1 ... xn y) iorel&lt;x1,...,xn,y&gt;)</span> 
     is a relation between the inputs <span class="v">x1</span>, ..., <span class="v">xn</span> 
     and the output <span class="v">y</span>. 
     This is a more general form than the pre/post-condition form PP, 
     which it subsumes.</p><p>In the `Specifications and Refinements' <a href="res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>design notes<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf"></nobr></a>, 
     the specification is denoted by S, 
     <span class="v">?f</span> is denoted by f, 
     <span class="v">x1</span>, ..., <span class="v">xn</span> are denoted by a single x 
     (the generalization to multiple variable is obvious), and 
     <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x1 ... xn y) iorel&lt;x1,...,xn&gt;)</span> is denoted by R.</p><h3>Input/Output Relation with Selected Input and Modified Inputs</h3><p>This form is denoted by Rf\alpha in the `Specifications and Refinements' <a href="res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>design notes<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf"></nobr></a>.</p><p>A specification of this form is a SOFT quantifier function 
     (see `Classification' section in <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFSOFT.html">soft::defsoft</a></span>) 
     that has no parameters, 
     that depends on one function variable (call it <span class="v">?f</span>), 
     and whose body has the form</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (x x1 ... xn)
        iorel&lt;x,x1,...,xn,(?f x a1&lt;x1,...,xn&gt; ... am&lt;x1,...,xn&gt;)&gt;)</pre><p>where <span class="v">n</span> may be 0 and 
     <span class="v">iorel&lt;...&gt;</span> is a term that depends on the quantified variables 
     and that contains a single occurrence of 
     a call of <span class="v">?f</span> of the form shown above, 
     where <span class="v">m</span> may be 0 and 
     each <span class="v">aj&lt;x1,...,xn&gt;</span> is a term that depends on <span class="v">x1</span>, ..., <span class="v">xn</span> 
     (and must not depend on <span class="v">x</span>). 
     The variable <span class="v">x</span> does not actually have to be 
     the first quantified variable in the list after <span class="v">forall</span> 
     and the first argument of the call of <span class="v">?f</span>: 
     it may be anywhere in the list and in any argument position, 
     as it is identified in same way by the APT transformations; 
     to ease exposition, in the documentation pages of the APT transformations, 
     we assume that it is the first one, as shown above.</p><p>This form generalizes the plain input/output relation form Rf, 
     because some of the inputs (namely <span class="v">x1</span>, ..., <span class="v">xn</span>) 
     are modified to become the terms <span class="v">aj&lt;x1,...,xn&gt;</span> 
     before <span class="v">?f</span> is applied to them; 
     in addition, one input (namely <span class="v">x</span>) is selected 
     and not subjected to that modification. 
     Thus, the input/output relation 
     <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x x1 ... xn y) iorel&lt;x,x1,...,xn,y&gt;)</span> 
     is applied, as the output, 
     not to a call of <span class="v">?f</span> directly on 
     the inputs <span class="v">x</span>, <span class="v">x1</span>, ..., <span class="v">xn</span>, 
     but to a call of <span class="v">?f</span> on 
     the inputs <span class="v">x</span>, <span class="v">a1&lt;x1,...,xn&gt;</span>, ..., <span class="v">am&lt;x,x1,...,xn&gt;</span>. 
     When <span class="v">m</span> is <span class="v">n</span> and each <span class="v">aj&lt;x1,...,xn&gt;</span> is <span class="v">xj</span>, 
     this form is the same as the plain input/output form Rf.</p><p>In the `Specifications and Refinements' <a href="res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>design notes<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to res/kestrel-apt-design-notes/specs-refs.pdf"></nobr></a>, 
     the specification is denoted by S, 
     <span class="v">?f</span> is denoted by f, 
     <span class="v">x</span> is denoted by x, 
     <span class="v">x1</span>, ..., <span class="v">xn</span> are denoted by \overline{x}, 
     <span class="v">a1&lt;x1,...,xn&gt;</span>, ..., <span class="v">am&lt;x1,...,xn&gt;</span> are denoted by 
     \overline{\alpha}(\overline{x}), and 
     <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x x1 ... xn y) iorel&lt;x,x1,...,xn,y&gt;)</span> 
     is denoted by R.</p>
