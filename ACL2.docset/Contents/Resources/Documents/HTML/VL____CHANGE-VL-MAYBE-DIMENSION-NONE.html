                <p>We construct a new <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-DIMENSION-NONE.html">vl-maybe-dimension-none</a> structure that is a copy of 
                <span class="v">x</span>, except that you can explicitly change some particular 
                fields.  Any fields you don't mention just keep their values 
                from <span class="v">x</span>.</p>
