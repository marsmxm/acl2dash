<p>Notion of second-order function.</p><p>A second-order function is an ACL2 function 
     that <a href="SOFT____FUNCTION-VARIABLE-DEPENDENCY.html">depends</a> on 
     one or more <a href="SOFT____FUNCTION-VARIABLES.html">function variables</a> 
     and that is explicitly recorded via <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFSOFT.html">defsoft</a></span>.</p><p>The function variables that the second-order function depends on 
     may be replaced by functions of matching arities, 
     obtaining a new function that is an 
     <a href="SOFT____SECOND-ORDER-FUNCTION-INSTANCES.html">instance</a> 
     of the second-order function.</p><h3>Naming Conventions</h3><p>Ending second-order function names 
     with the function variables it depends on (in any order), 
     enclosed in square brackets, 
     as in the examples in the SOFT documentation pages, 
     conveys the dependency on the function variables 
     and provides a visual cue for their implicit presence. 
     However, SOFT does not enforce this naming convention.</p>
