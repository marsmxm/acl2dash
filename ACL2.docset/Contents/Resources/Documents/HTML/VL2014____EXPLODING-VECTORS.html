<p>How we convert Verilog wires (which might be vectors) into E 
wires (which are just bits).</p><p>A significant difference between E and Verilog is that there are no 
vectors in E.  Whereas our Verilog module might have a vector like <span class="v">wire
[7:0] w</span>, our E module will instead have eight individual wires, whose names 
are <span class="v">ACL2::|w[7]|</span> through <span class="v">ACL2::|w[0]|</span>.</p> 
 
<p>There is a fair bit of code geared towards making this bit-level conversion 
safe and efficient.  As a quick summary:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We represent each of these "exploded" wires like <span class="v">ACL2::|w[0]|</span> as an 
<a href="VL2014____VL-EMODWIRE-P.html">vl-emodwire-p</a>.  This representation includes an encoding scheme that 
usually produces readable names and avoids name clashes, even when escaped 
identifiers are used.</li> 
 
<li>The E wires for all of a module's net and register declarations can be 
bundled into a <a href="VL2014____VL-WIREALIST-P.html">vl-wirealist-p</a>.  A wire alist is generally constructed 
with <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-WIREALIST.html">vl-module-wirealist</a>, which provides certain uniqueness 
guarantees.</li> 
 
<li>Certain "simple" expressions (similar to <a href="VL2014____EXPR-SLICING.html">sliceable</a> expressions) can be converted into wires using 
<a href="VL2014____VL-MSB-EXPR-BITLIST.html">vl-msb-expr-bitlist</a>, which does lots of sanity checking to ensure that 
the sizes and bounds of the expressions are correct and that only defined wires 
are being used.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>BOZO much of this code predates the exprsesion slicing code.  We may wish to 
eventually redo significant portions of the wirealist stuff to instead be based 
on the expression-slicing code.</p>
