 <p><i>Introduction.</i> Suppose we define <span class="v">foo</span> in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> 
 mode to take the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span> of its argument.  This can cause a raw Lisp 
 error.  ACL2 will then return control to its top-level loop unless you enable 
 the Lisp debugger, as shown below (except: the error message can take quite a 
 different form in non-ANSI GCL).</p>

Error:  Attempt to take the car of 3 which is not listp.
***********************************************

If you didn't cause an explicit interrupt (Control-C),
then the root cause may be call of a :program mode
function that has the wrong guard specified, or even no
guard specified (i.e., an implicit guard of t).
See :DOC guards.

To enable breaks into the debugger (also see :DOC acl2-customization):

 <p><i>Details.</i> ACL2 usage is intended to take place inside the ACL2 
 read-eval-print loop (see <a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a>).  Indeed, in most Lisp implementations 
 ACL2 comes up inside that loop, as evidenced by the prompt:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>However, one can occasionally hit a raw Lisp error.  Here is the above 
 example again, this time for a GCL implementation, which unfortunately gives a 
 slightly less aesthetic report.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(foo 3)

Error: 3 is not of type LIST.
Fast links are on: do (si::use-fast-links nil) for debugging
Error signalled by CAR.
Backtrace: funcall &gt; system:top-level &gt; lisp:lambda-closure &gt; lp &gt; acl2_*1*_acl2::foo &gt; foo &gt; car &gt; system:universal-error-handler &gt; system::break-level-for-acl2 &gt; let* &gt; UNLESS
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Here, the user has defined <span class="v">foo</span> in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode, with an 
 implicit <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of <span class="v">t</span>.  The ACL2 evaluator therefore called the Lisp 
 evaluator, which expected <span class="v">nil</span> or a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span> argument to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, ACL2 will return to its top-level loop (at the same level of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>) when there is a raw Lisp error, as though a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a></span> 
 with flag <span class="v">HARD</span> has been evaluated.  If instead you want to enter the raw 
 Lisp debugger in such cases, evaluate the following form.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a> t)</pre> 
 
 <p>You can subsequently return to the default behavior with:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a> nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>Either way, you can enter the Lisp debugger from within the ACL2 loop by 
 evaluating <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BREAK_42.html">break$</a></span><span class="v">)</span>.  If you want <span class="v">break$</span> disabled, then 
 evaluate the following, which disables entry to the Lisp debugger not only for 
 Lisp errors but also when executing <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BREAK_42.html">break$</a>)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a> :never)</pre> 
 
 <p>The discussion above also applies to interrupts (from <span class="v">Control-C</span>) in 
 some, but not all, host Common Lisps â€” perhaps all except for non-ANSI 
 GCL, where interrupts will likely always put you into the debugger.</p> 
 
 <p>It remains to discuss options <span class="v">:break</span>, <span class="v">:bt</span>, <span class="v">:break-bt</span>, and 
 <span class="v">:bt-break</span>.  Option <span class="v">:break</span> is synonymous with option <span class="v">t</span>, while 
 option <span class="v">:bt</span> prints a backtrace.  Options <span class="v">:break-bt</span> and <span class="v">:bt-break</span> 
 are equivalent, and each has the combined effect of <span class="v">:bt</span> and <span class="v">:break</span>: 
 a backtrace is printed and then the debugger is entered.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">set-debugger-enable</span> applies not only to raw Lisp errors, but 
 also to ACL2 errors: those affected by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a></span>.  However, for 
 ACL2 errors, entering the debugger is controlled only by <span class="v">break-on-error</span>, 
 not by <span class="v">set-debugger-enable</span>.  For ACL2 errors encountered after evaluating 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a> t)</span>, the <span class="v">set-debugger-enable</span> values of <span class="v">:bt</span>, 
 <span class="v">:break-bt</span>, and <span class="v">:bt-break</span> will result in the same effect: in many 
 host Lisps, this effect will be to cause a backtrace to be printed.</p> 
 
 <p>Remark for Common Lisp hackers (except for the case that the host Lisp is 
 non-ANSI GCL).  You can customize the form of the backtrace printed by 
 entering raw Lisp (with <span class="v">:q</span>) and then redefining function 
 <span class="v">print-call-history</span>, whose definition immediately precedes that of 
 <span class="v">break-on-error</span> in ACL2 source file <span class="v">ld.lisp</span>.  Of course, all bets are 
 off when defining any function in raw Lisp, but as a practical matter you are 
 probably fine as long as your books are ultimately certified with an 
 unmodified copy of ACL2.  If you come up with improvements to 
 <span class="v">print-call-history</span>, please pass them along to the ACL2 
 implementors.</p>
