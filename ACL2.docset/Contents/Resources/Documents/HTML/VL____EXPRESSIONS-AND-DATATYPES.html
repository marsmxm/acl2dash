<p>Representation of expressions, datatypes, and other related, 
          mutually recursive concepts.</p><p>SystemVerilog has a very rich expression language.  For 
         instance:</p> 
 
         <ul> 
 
         <li>It has many kinds of literals, including integer literals that can 
         be sized and unsized, ``weird'' integers like <span class="v">4'10xz</span>, infinitely 
         extended integers like <span class="v">'0</span>, reals, times, strings, etc.  See <a href="VL____VL-LITERAL.html">vl-literal</a>.</li> 
 
         <li>It has a rich operand syntax that allows for scoping, indexing 
         into the module hierarchy and structures, and for many kinds of 
         bit/range selects into wires, arrays, etc.  See <a href="VL____VL-INDEX.html">vl-index</a>.</li> 
 
         <li>It has many familiar C-like operators (<span class="v">+</span>, <span class="v">&amp;</span>, etc.) and 
         numerous extended C-like operators (<span class="v">===</span>, <span class="v">!=?</span>, <span class="v">&gt;&gt;&gt;</span>, 
         etc.)  See <a href="VL____VL-UNARY.html">vl-unary</a>, <a href="VL____VL-BINARY.html">vl-binary</a>, and <a href="VL____VL-QMARK.html">vl-qmark</a>.</li> 
 
         <li>It has certain casting and function call operators that allow for 
         the use of <b>datatypes directly in expressions</b>, which makes 
         expressions and datatypes <b>mutually recursive</b> concepts.</li> 
 
         <li>It has several esoteric operators like <span class="v">inside</span> and the 
         streaming operators, which have their own sub-syntax of sorts.</li> 
 
         <li>It has nested attributes like <span class="tt">(* foo, bar = 5 *)</span> that can 
         be attached to almost any expression as annotations for tools.  See 
         <a href="VL____VL-ATTS.html">vl-atts</a>.</li> 
 
         </ul> 
 
         <p>These expressions occur pretty much everywhere throughout a 
         SystemVerilog designâ€”ports, parameters, assignments, instances, 
         statements, you name it.  This complexity and frequency of usage makes 
         a good representation of expressions especially important.</p> 
 
         <p>A major differences between <a href="ACL2____VL2014.html">vl2014</a> and <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> is that VL 
         uses a new, more mutually recursive, and more strongly typed 
         expression representation.  See <a href="VL____NEW-EXPRESSION-REPRESENTATION.html">new-expression-representation</a> 
         for some discussion about the motivation for this change.</p> 
 
         <p>Note that there are many useful functions for working with 
         expressions in <a href="VL____MLIB.html">mlib</a>.  See most especially <a href="VL____EXPR-TOOLS.html">expr-tools</a> 
         which contains many basic functions.</p>
