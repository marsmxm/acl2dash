<p>Example of reading files in ACL2</p><p>This example illustrates the use of ACL2's <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a> primitives to 
 read the forms in a file.  See <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>This example provides a solution to the following problem.  Let's say that 
 you have a file that contains s-expressions.  Suppose that you want to build a 
 list by starting with <span class="v">nil</span>, and updating it ``appropriately'' upon 
 encountering each successive s-expression in the file.  That is, suppose that 
 you have written a function <span class="v">update-list</span> such that <span class="v">(update-list obj
 current-list)</span> returns the list obtained by ``updating'' <span class="v">current-list</span> 
 with the next object, <span class="v">obj</span>, encountered in the file.  The top-level 
 function for processing such a file, returning the final list, could be 
 defined as follows.  Notice that because it opens a channel to the given file, 
 this function modifies <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> and hence must return <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  Thus 
 it actually returns two values: the final list and the new <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> process-file (filename state)
  (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a>
   (channel state)
   (<a href="ACL2____OPEN-INPUT-CHANNEL.html">open-input-channel</a> filename :object state)
   (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a> (result state)
           (process-file1 nil channel state) ;see below
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> (<a href="ACL2____CLOSE-INPUT-CHANNEL.html">close-input-channel</a> channel state)))
             (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> result state)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">process-file1</span> referred to above takes the currently 
 constructed list (initially, <span class="v">nil</span>), together with a channel to the file 
 being read and the <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, and returns the final updated list.  Notice 
 that this function is tail recursive.  This is important because many Lisp 
 compilers will remove tail recursion, thus avoiding the potential for stack 
 overflows when the file contains a large number of forms.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> process-file1 (current-list channel state)
  (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a> (eofp obj state)
          (<a href="ACL2____READ-OBJECT.html">read-object</a> channel state)
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a>
           (eofp (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> current-list state))
           (t (process-file1 (update-list obj current-list)
                             channel state)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>As an exercise, you might want to add <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s to the functions above 
 and verify the guards (see <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>).  See <a href="ACL2____ARGS.html">args</a> or make a 
 call of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> 'your-function nil (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span> to see the guard of 
 an existing function.</p>
