<p>Regular expression library for ACL2</p><p>This library is modeled after the regular expression parsing 
         functionality of GNU grep.  While the code is mostly considered to be 
         complete enough for now, we invite those who wish to improve the 
         documentation to go ahead and do so.  As of March 2013, this library 
         is compliant with 579 of the 646 GNU grep regression suite tests (see 
         book projects/regex/regex-tests for those tests).</p> 
 
         <p>To start using the regex library, include book 
         <span class="tt">projects/regex/regex-ui</span>.</p> 
 
         <p>This library supports "Basic", "Extended", and "Fixed" 
         regular expressions (see <a href="ACL2____PARSE-OPTIONS.html">parse-options</a>).  Although some 
         implementations of GNU Grep support "Perl" regular expressions, we 
         do not yet implement them.  If a user is motivated to provide such an 
         extension, they should feel free to do so.</p> 
 
         <p>This library does not currently support features like [[:digit:]] and 
         [[:alpha:]].  A workaround for this is specifying the expansion of 
         these named classes, respectively, as in [0-9] and [a-zA-Z].</p>
