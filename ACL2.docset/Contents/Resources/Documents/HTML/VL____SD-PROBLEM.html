<p>An alleged problem noticed by skip detection.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>type — <a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>What kind of problem this is.  At the moment the type is always 
          <span class="v">:skipped</span> and means that we think some wire is suspiciously 
          skipped. But we imagine that we could add other kinds of analysis 
          that look, e.g., for wires that are oddly duplicated, etc., and hence 
          have other types.</dd> 
 
<dt>priority — <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>A heuristic score that we give to problems to indicate how likely 
              they are to be a real problem.  For instance, we assign extra 
              priority to a sequence of wires like <span class="v">foo1</span>, <span class="v">foo2</span>, 
              <span class="v">foo4</span>, <span class="v">foo5</span> because the skipped wire is in the middle. 
              We also might assign extra priority if one of the other wires is 
              duplicated.</dd> 
 
<dt>groupsize — <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Says how many wires had this same pattern.  We generally think 
               that the larger the group size is, the more likely the problem 
               is to be legitimate.</dd> 
 
<dt>key — <a href="VL____SD-KEY.html">sd-key</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The <a href="VL____SD-KEY-P.html">sd-key-p</a> for the missing wire.</dd> 
 
<dt>ctx — <a href="VL____VL-CONTEXT1.html">vl-context1</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Says where this problem originates.</dd>
