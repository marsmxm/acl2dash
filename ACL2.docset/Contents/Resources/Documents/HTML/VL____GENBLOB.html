<p>An abstraction that is useful for processing <span class="v">generate</span> 
constructs.</p><p>The VL <a href="VL____SYNTAX.html">syntax</a> representation for <span class="v">generate</span> blocks is a 
relatively complicated mutual recursion; see <a href="VL____VL-GENELEMENT.html">vl-genelement</a>.</p> 
 
<p>In some cases you may not care about the particulars of generate statements. 
For instance, say you just wanted to collect up the names of all the modules 
that are being instantiated by a module.  In this case, you don't care whether 
the modules are instantiated inside of generate blocks or not.  But because of 
the elaborate mutual recursion, properly supporting <span class="v">generate</span> blocks is a 
hassle.</p> 
 
<p>BOZO document def-genblob-transform and explain this stuff.</p>
