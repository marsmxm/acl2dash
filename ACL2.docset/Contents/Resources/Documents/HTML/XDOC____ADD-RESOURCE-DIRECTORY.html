<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=XDOC____ADD-RESOURCE-DIRECTORY">Click for Add-resource-directory in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Tell <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> about directories of resources (e.g., images, PDF 
files, etc.) that should be copied into manuals.</p><p>Occasionally you may wish to include images or other files within 
an XDOC documentation topic.  For this to work, XDOC's <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">save</a> command 
needs to know about these files so that it can copy them into the manual it 
produces.  The <span class="v">add-resource-directory</span> command lets you tell XDOC which 
directories to copy and what to name them.</p> 
 
<h3>Example</h3> 
 
<p>Suppose that in the <span class="v">vl</span> library there are some images that we want to 
include in the manual.  We can put these images into a directory, say 
<span class="v">images</span>, and then do:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="XDOC____ADD-RESOURCE-DIRECTORY.html">xdoc::add-resource-directory</a> "vl" "images")</pre> 
 
<p>This will cause the <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">save</a> command to copy everything from the 
<span class="v">images</span> directory into the <span class="v">res/vl</span> directory of our manual.  To refer 
to these images, we can then write <a href="XDOC____MARKUP.html">markup</a> such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">&lt;img src="res/vl/logo.jpg"/&gt;</pre> 
 
<p>These resource directories might also contain files other than images, for 
instance, PDF files.  You can at provide hyperlinks to these files by just 
linking into the <span class="v">res</span> directory, for instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">&lt;a href="res/vl/slides.pdf"&gt;See the Slides!&lt;/a&gt;</pre> 
 
 
<h3>General form</h3> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="XDOC____ADD-RESOURCE-DIRECTORY.html">xdoc::add-resource-directory</a> dirname path)</pre> 
 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<b>dirname</b> controls where the directory will be placed in within the 
manual's <span class="v">res</span> directory.  In the example above, the <span class="v">dirname</span> is 
<span class="v">"vl"</span> so the files will be copied into <span class="v">"res/vl"</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>path</b> controls where the files will be copied from.  We recommend 
always using a simple path such as the name of an immediate subdirectory.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h3>Working example</h3> 
 
<p>The directory <span class="v">books/xdoc/centaur</span> contains a <span class="v">centaur-logo.png</span> file. 
The file <span class="v">xdoc/topics.lisp</span> adds this directory as a resource directory.  If 
all is well, you should see the logo below:</p> 
 
<div class="ximg"><img src="../res/centaur/centaur-logo.png"></div>
