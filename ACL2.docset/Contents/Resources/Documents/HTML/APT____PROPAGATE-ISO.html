<p>Propagate an isomorphism from a set of isomorphically transformed functions to events that use them.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p><span class="v">propagate-iso</span> takes one or more isomorphisms and a set of functions and a sequence of events 
      and propagates the isomorphisms from the given set of functions to those events that reference any of 
      these functions either directly or directly. It maintains a substitution from old functions to their new isomorphic 
      functions. For function definitions it creates a new function by applying the substitution to the old body and 
      extends the substitution to map the old function name to the newly created function name. Similarly, it applies 
      the substitution to existing theorems to generate theorems on the new functions.  Currently does not handle 
      mutual recursion.</p><h3>General Form</h3><pre class="code">(<a href="APT____PROPAGATE-ISO.html">propagate-iso</a> isomorphism-name-or-names

      theorem for rewriting <span class="v">iso-fn</span> to <span class="v">fn</span>.  <span class="v">arg-sig</span> gives the signature of 
      the argument list of <span class="v">fn</span> with respect to the isomorphism, i.e. if an argument of 
      <span class="v">fn</span> is of one of the isomorphism types (predicate) then the corresponding element 
      of the signature is that predicate, otherwise it is <span class="v">*</span>.  Similarly, if <span class="v">fn</span> 
      returns a single value then it is <span class="v">*</span> or the name of an isomorphism predicate, or if 
      it returns multiple values then it is a list of such values.</p>
