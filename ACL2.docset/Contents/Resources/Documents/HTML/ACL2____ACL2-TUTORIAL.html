<p>Tutorial introduction to ACL2</p><p>To learn about ACL2, read at least the following two links.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____INTERESTING-APPLICATIONS.html">Industrial Applications of 
 ACL2</a> (10 minutes) to help you understand what sophisticated users can 
 do;</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____A_02Flying_02Tour_02of_02ACL2.html">A Flying Tour</a> (10 
 minutes) to get an overview of the system and what skills the user must 
 have.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Alternatively, or in addition, there are <a href="ACL2____TALKS.html">talks</a> that you can peruse, 
 many of them introductory in nature.</p> 
 
 <p>If you want to learn <i>how to use</i> ACL2, we recommend that you read a 
 selection of the materials referenced below, depending on your learning style, 
 and do suggested exercises.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____A_02Walking_02Tour_02of_02ACL2.html">A Walking 
 Tour</a> (1 hour) provides an overview of the theorem prover.</li> 
 
 <li>The <a href="http://tryacl2.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Try ACL2<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://tryacl2.org"></nobr></a> web site provides 
 interactive lessons to get you started using ACL2.</li> 
 
 <li>See <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> (10-40 hours) for 
 instruction on how to interact with the system.  Unlike the three documents 
 above, this document expects you to <i>think</i>!  It cites the necessary 
 background pages on programming in ACL2 and on the logic and then instructs 
 you in <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a>, which is how expert users use ACL2.  It concludes 
 with some challenge problems for the ACL2 beginner (including solutions) and 
 an FAQ.  Most users will spend several hours a day for several days working 
 through this material.</li> 
 
 <li>The book <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-books/car/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>Computer-Aided 
 Reasoning: An Approach<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-books/car/index.html"></nobr></a> is worth a careful read, as you work exercises and 
 learn <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____ANNOTATED-ACL2-SCRIPTS.html">Annotated ACL2 Scripts and 
 Demos</a> contains relatively elementary proof scripts that have been 
 annotated to help train the newcomer.</li> 
 
 <li>Many files (``books'') in the ACL2 community books (see <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>) are extensively annotated.</li> 
 
 <li>An <a href="ACL2____ALTERNATIVE-INTRODUCTION.html">Alternative 
 Introduction</a> document, while largely subsumed by the <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">Introduction to the Theorem Prover</a> 
 mentioned above, still might be useful because it covers much of the tutorial 
 material in a different way.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>At this point you are probably ready to use ACL2 on your own <i>small</i> 
 projects.  A common mistake for beginners is to browse the documentation and 
 then try to do something that is too big!  Think of a very small project and 
 then simplify it!</p> 
 
 <p>Note that ACL2 has a very supportive user network.  See the link to 
 ``Mailing Lists'' on the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2 home page<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The topics listed below are a hodge podge, developed over time.  Although 
 some of these are not mentioned above, you might find some to be useful as 
 well.</p>
