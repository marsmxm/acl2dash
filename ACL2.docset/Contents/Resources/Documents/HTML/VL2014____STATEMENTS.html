<p>Representation of a statement.</p><p>Verilog includes a number of statements for behavioral modelling. 
Some of these (assignments, event triggers, enables and disables) are 
<b>atomic</b> in that they do not contain any sub-statements.  We call the 
other statements (loops, cases, if statements, etc.) <b>compound</b> since they 
contain sub-statements and are mutually-recursive with <span class="v">vl-stmt-p</span>.</p>
