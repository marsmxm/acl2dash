<p>Abstract placeholders for 
          the Java floating-point values [JLS:4.2.3].</p><p>We introduce constrained recognizers for 
     the float and double value sets, as well as for 
     the float-extended-exponent and double-extended-exponent value sets 
     [JLS:4.2.3]. 
     The recognizers for the float and double value sets 
     are constrained to be non-empty, 
     via a companion nullary witness function for each, 
     which we also use to define a fixer and a fixtype. 
     The recognizers of the extended-exponent value sets 
     are constrained to be non-empty if and only if 
     the respective value sets are supported, 
     as described by the <a href="JAVA____FLOATING-POINT-VALUE-SET-PARAMETERS.html">parameters</a> of our model; 
     their non-emptiness constraints is also expressed via 
     companion nullary witness functions. 
     Since the non-emptiness is conditional (to the parameter's value), 
     we define conditional fixers, but cannot define fixtypes. 
     The nullary witness function for each value sets 
     is regarded as returning the positive 0 for that value set, 
     which is the default value for floating-point variables [JLS:4.12.5]; 
     this is just reflected in the name of the witness function, 
     not in any constraint property of it.</p>
