<p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-FAST-ALIST.html">make-fast-alist</a> alist)</span> creates a fast-alist from the input 
alist, returning <span class="v">alist</span> itself or, in some cases, a new object equal to 
it.</p><p>Note: it is often better to use <span class="v">with-fast-alist</span>; see <a href="ACL2____WITH-FAST-ALIST.html">with-fast-alist</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Logically, <span class="v">make-fast-alist</span> is the identity function.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Function: </b>make-fast-alist</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> make-fast-alist (alist)
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))
       alist)</pre> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, we construct and return an object that is <span class="v">equal</span> to 
 <span class="v">alist</span> and which is a fast alist.  If <span class="v">alist</span> is already a fast alist, 
 almost no work is required: we simply return it unchanged.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">alist</span> is not fast, we must minimally construct a hash table for 
 its bindings.  It is often possible to bind this new hash table to <span class="v">alist</span> 
 itself.  But in certain cases when the alist keys are not <a href="ACL2____NORMED.html">normed</a>, a new 
 alist must be constructed, also, and so we may return an <span class="v">equal</span> but not 
 <span class="v">eq</span> alist.  (In these cases, we still try to avoid at least some consing 
 by reusing the "longest normed tail" of the alist.)</p>
