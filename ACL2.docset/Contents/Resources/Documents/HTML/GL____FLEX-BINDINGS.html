<p>Shape specifiers for <span class="v">:g-bindings</span>, more flexible than <a href="GL____AUTO-BINDINGS.html">auto-bindings</a>.</p><p>The <span class="v">flex-bindings</span> function lets you create somewhat more 
complicated <a href="GL____SHAPE-SPECS.html">shape-specs</a> than is possible with <a href="GL____AUTO-BINDINGS.html">auto-bindings</a>.  We 
assume familiarity with <a href="GL____AUTO-BINDINGS.html">auto-bindings</a> in this documentation.  The 
specific feature <span class="v">flex-bindings</span> offers that auto-bindings does not is the 
ability to split an integer variable into segments and generate indices for 
each segment independently.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a> foo
  ...
  :g-bindings (<a href="GL____FLEX-BINDINGS.html">flex-bindings</a>                          ; expands to:
                ;; auto-bindings list -- generates indices
                ((:int a1 10)
                 (:rev (:mix (:int a2 13)
                             (:int b1 13)))
                 (:int b2 10))
                :arrange         ;; generate shape spec bindings from the indices
                ((:int a a1 a2)  ;; a is a g-integer, indices are a1's appended to a2's
                 (:int b b1 b2))))</pre> 
 
<p>The first argument is just a list of auto-bindings (though the syntax 
differs trivially in that flex-bindings takes them in a single argument whereas 
<a href="GL____AUTO-BINDINGS.html">auto-bindings</a> uses <span class="v">&amp;rest args</span>).  They are used to generate indices, 
but not the actual g-bindings.  We generate from these a mapping from each 
variable name to its list of indices.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">:arrange</span> argument, if provided, must be a list consisting of the 
following sorts of forms: </p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:int a b c ...)</span> means generate an integer shape-spec binding for 
variable <span class="v">a</span>, consisting of the appended indices of <span class="v">b</span>, <span class="v">c</span>, etc., 
from the auto-bindings form.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:int a)</span> means generate an integer shape-spec binding for variable 
<span class="v">a</span> using the indices of <span class="v">a</span> from the auto-bindings form.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:bool a)</span> means generate a Boolean binding for variable <span class="v">a</span>, 
using the index of <span class="v">a</span> from the auto-bindings form.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(:bool a b)</span> means generate a Boolean binding for variable <span class="v">a</span>, 
using the index of <span class="v">b</span> from the auto-bindings form.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>If the <span class="v">:arrange</span> argument is not provided, <a href="GL____FLEX-BINDINGS.html">flex-bindings</a> acts 
just like <a href="GL____AUTO-BINDINGS.html">auto-bindings</a> -- it generates an entry for each variable 
mentioned in the auto-bindings.</p>
