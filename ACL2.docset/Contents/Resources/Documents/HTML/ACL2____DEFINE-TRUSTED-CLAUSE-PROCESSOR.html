<p>Define a trusted (unverified) goal-level simplifier</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> assumes familiarity with 
 <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rules; see <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>.  Briefly put, a 
 <i>clause-processor</i> is a user-defined function that takes as input the 
 ACL2 representation of a goal — a <i>clause</i> — and returns a 
 list of goals (i.e., a list of clauses).  A <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rule is a 
 way to inform ACL2 that a clause-processor has been proved correct and now may 
 be specified in <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here we describe a utility, <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span>, that 
 provides another way to inform ACL2 that a function is to be considered a 
 clause-processor that can be specified in a <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> hint.  You 
 can find examples of correct and incorrect use of this utility in community 
 book <span class="v">books/clause-processors/basic-examples</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider the simple example already presented for <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> 
 rules (again, see <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>), for a simple clause-processor 
 named <span class="v">note-fact-clause-processor</span>.  Instead of introducing an evaluator 
 and proving a correctness theorem with <span class="v">:rule-classes :clause-processor</span>, 
 we can simply inform ACL2 that we trust the function 
 <span class="v">note-fact-clause-processor</span> to serve as a clause-processor.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFINE-TRUSTED-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">define-trusted-clause-processor</a>
  note-fact-clause-processor
  nil
  :ttag my-ttag)</pre> 
 
 <p>A non-nil <span class="v">:ttag</span> argument generates a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></span> event in order to 
 acknowledge the dependence of the ACL2 session on the (unproved) correctness 
 of this clause-processor.  That argument can be omitted if there is currently 
 an active trust tag.  Note that the extra <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></span> event will be <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> to the <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> event; that is, its effect 
 will disappear after the <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> event completes. 
 This point becomes clear if one understands that a call of 
 <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> expands to a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, 
 and a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></span> event is essentially <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> within any <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event, as is any event that sets the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>. 
 See <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>.  Because we are trusting this clause-processor, rather 
 than having proved it correct, we refer to it as a ``trusted'' 
 clause-processor to contrast with a proved-correct, or ``verified'', 
 clause-processor.</p> 
 
 <p>Now that the event displayed above has established 
 <span class="v">note-fact-clause-processor</span> as a (trusted) clause-processor, we can use it 
 in a <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> hint, for example as follows.  Notice that the 
 output is identical to that for the corresponding example presented for the 
 verified case (see <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>), except that the word ``verified'' 
 has been replaced by the word ``trusted''.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x y))
                   x)
            :hints
            (("Goal"
              :clause-processor
              (note-fact-clause-processor clause '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> a a)))))

[Note:  A hint was supplied for our processing of the goal above.
Thanks!]

We now apply the trusted :CLAUSE-PROCESSOR function NOTE-FACT-CLAUSE-
PROCESSOR to produce two new subgoals.

Subgoal 2
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> A A)

But we reduce the conjecture to T, by the :executable-counterpart of
IF and the simple :rewrite rule CAR-CONS.

Subgoal 1
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> A A).

But we reduce the conjecture to T, by primitive type reasoning.

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Indeed, if one runs this example first and subsequently verifies the 
 clause-processor, one will see the word ``trusted'' change to 
 ``verified''.</p> 
 
 <p>The general form is as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFINE-TRUSTED-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">define-trusted-clause-processor</a>
  cl-proc           ;;; clause-processor function
  supporters        ;;; see below
  &amp;key
  label             ;;; optional; cl-proc$label by default
  ttag              ;;; discussed above
  partial-theory    ;;; optional encapsulate event
  )</pre> 
 
 <p>We discussed the <span class="v">:ttag</span> argument above, and we will discuss the 
 <span class="v">supporters</span> and <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> arguments later below.  Let us turn 
 our attention to the <span class="v">label</span> argument and its ramifications for undoing and 
 redundancy.</p> 
 
 <p>As mentioned above, a successful <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> event 
 results in an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event.  If the <span class="v">:label</span> argument is 
 supplied with a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value <span class="v">L</span>, or if <span class="v">:label</span> is omitted and 
 <span class="v">L</span> is the result of adding the suffix <span class="v">"$LABEL"</span> to <span class="v">cl-proc</span>, 
 then the event <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a> L)</span> will be included under the resulting 
 <span class="v">encapsulate</span> form.  Thus, you will be able to undo this 
 <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span><span class="v"> L</span>.  Also, 
 because of the criteria for redundant encapsulate events (see <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-ENCAPSULATE.html">redundant-encapsulate</a>), the entire form is considered redundant (skipped) if 
 it is identical to one already executed in the current ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, with 
 one exception: if <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> or omitted, and also 
 <span class="v">:label nil</span> is supplied explicitly, then the event will not be redundant. 
 If the event is not redundant, then <span class="v">cl-proc</span> must not already be 
 designated as a trusted clause-processor.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">cl-proc</span> may be defined either in <span class="v">:program</span>-mode or 
 <span class="v">:logic</span>-mode.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">supporters</span> argument should be a true list of function symbols in 
 the current ACL2 world.  It is important that this list include user-defined 
 functions whose definitions support the correctness of the clause-processor 
 function.  Otherwise, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> definitions of those missing supporters 
 can render the use of this clause-processor unsound, as discussed in the paper 
 referenced at the end of the <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a> documentation topic. 
 Below we discuss an additional reason that <span class="v">supporters</span> is critical for 
 soundness, in the case of dependent clause-processors.</p> 
 
 <p>(Remark.  There could have been two notions of supporters: one for 
 functions whose definitions support the correctness of the clause-processor 
 function, and, in the case of dependent clause-processors, one for supporters 
 of the ``promised encapsulate'' discussed below.  But for simplicity, a single 
 <span class="v">supporters</span> argument serves both purposes.)</p> 
 
 <p><b>Dependent clause-processors and promised encapsulates</b>: The 
 <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> argument</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose you want to introduce a clause-processor to reason about a complex 
 hardware simulator that is implemented outside ACL2.  Sawada and Reeber had 
 just such a problem, as reported in their FMCAD 2006 paper.  Indeed, they used 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></span> to implement a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span>-mode function in ACL2 
 that can invoke that simulator.  (This has been changed to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL_A2.html">sys-call*</a></span> 
 since <span class="v">sys-call</span> cannot invoke the OS during proofs; see <a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a>.) 
 In principle one could code the simulator directly in ACL2; but it would be a 
 tremendous amount of work that has no practical purpose, given the interface 
 to the external simulator.  So: In what sense can we have a clause-processor 
 that proves properties about a simulator when that simulator is not fully 
 axiomatized in ACL2?  Our answer, in a nutshell, is this: The above 
 <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> argument provides a way to write merely some of the <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s on the external tool (or even no constraints at all), with the 
 understanding that such constraints are present implicitly in a stronger 
 ``promised'' <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, for example by exporting the full 
 definition.</p> 
 
 <p>If a trusted clause-processor is introduced with a non-<span class="v">nil</span> 
 <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> argument, we call it a ``dependent'' clause-processor, 
 because its correctness is dependent on the constraints implicitly introduced 
 by the <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> <span class="v">encapsulate</span> form.  The implicit constraints 
 should logically imply the constraints actually introduced by the explicit 
 <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, but they should also be sufficient to justify every possible 
 invocation of the clause-processor in a <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> hint.  The user 
 of a <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> form is making a guarantee — 
 or, is relying on a guarantee provided by the writer of that form — that 
 in principle, there exists a so-called ``promised encapsulate'': an 
 <span class="v">encapsulate</span> form with the same <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> as the 
 <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> <span class="v">encapsulate</span> form associated with the trusted 
 clause-processor, but whose constraints introduced are the aforementioned 
 implicit constraints.</p> 
 
 <p>There are several additional requirements on a <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> 
 argument.  First, it must be an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event with non-empty <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>.  Moreover, the functions introduced by that event must be exactly 
 those specified in the signature, and no more.  And further still, the 
 <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> form cannot be executed inside any <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form with non-empty <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>; we can think of this 
 situation as attempting to associate more than one <span class="v">encapsulate</span> with the 
 functions introduced in the inner <span class="v">encapsulate</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Moreover, soundness depends on inclusion of enough function symbols in the 
 <span class="v">supporters</span> argument, as follows.  Let <span class="v">S</span> be the set of specified 
 <span class="v">supporters</span> augmented by the set of function symbols either introduced by, 
 or in a property exported by, the <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> argument, which we call 
 the ``promised encapsulate''.  Then every function symbol constrained by the 
 promised encapsulate is in <span class="v">S</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> event will (in essence) be executed as part of the 
 evaluation of the <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> form.  Again, a 
 critical obligation rests on the user who provides a <span class="v">:partial-theory</span>: 
 there must exist (in principle at least) a corresponding promised encapsulate 
 form with the same <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> that could logically be admitted, whenever 
 the above <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> form is evaluated successfully, 
 that justifies the designation of <span class="v">cl-proc</span> as a clause-processor.  See 
 also the paper mentioned above for more about promised encapsulates.  A key 
 consequence is that the <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s are unknown for the functions 
 introduced in (the signature of) a <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> 
 form.  Thus, functional instantiation (see <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION-EXAMPLE.html">functional-instantiation-example</a>) is disabled for function in the signature 
 of a <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> form.</p> 
 
 <p><b>A remark on the underlying implementation</b></p> 
 
 <p>You can see all of the current trusted clause-processors by issuing the 
 command <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> trusted-cl-proc-table)</span>.  The resulting alist associates 
 each trusted clause-processor with its supporters.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">define-trusted-clause-processor</span> is actually a macro that 
 generates (among other things) a <span class="v">table</span> event for extending 
 <span class="v">trusted-cl-proc-table</span>.  You are invited to use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS1.html">trans1</a></span> to 
 see expansions of calls of this macro.  In particular, you can see that the 
 <span class="v">:partial-theory</span> argument results in an <span class="v">encapsulate</span> event that 
 includes a call of the form <span class="v">(set-unknown-constraints-supporters f1
 ... fk)</span>, which in effect makes that call of <span class="v">encapsulate</span> into a call of 
 <span class="v">partial-encapsulate</span> with supporters <span class="v">(f1 ... fk)</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____PARTIAL-ENCAPSULATE.html">partial-encapsulate</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>A technique for using raw Lisp to define a trusted 
 clause-processor</b></p> 
 
 <p>The following code is intended to give an idea for how one might define the 
 ``guts'' of a trusted clause-processor in raw Lisp.  The idea is to stub out 
 functions, such as <span class="v">acl2-my-prove below</span>, that you want to define in raw 
 Lisp; and then, load a raw Lisp file to overwrite any such function with the 
 real code.  But then we make any such overwritten function untouchable.  (This 
 last step is important because otherwise, one can prove <span class="v">nil</span> using a 
 <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> <span class="v">:use</span> hint, by exploiting the fact that this 
 function has executable code for which there is no corresponding definitional 
 axiom.)  Note: The point here is only to illustrate the use of raw Lisp, so we 
 do not bother to define or explain functions <span class="v">hint-to-termlist</span> or 
 <span class="v">disjoin-clause-segments-to-clause</span>, which this example assumes are defined 
 elsewhere; their meanings are not important for this example.</p>
