<p>Java reference types [JLS:4.3].</p><p>We formalize Java reference types as syntactic entities. 
     Reference values are formalized <a href="JAVA____REFERENCE-VALUES.html">here</a>.</p><p>The relevant grammar rules are 
     the ones in [JLS:4.3] (for <span class="v">reference-type</span> etc.) 
     and the ones in [JLS:4.5.1] (for <span class="v">type-arguments</span> etc.). 
     The rules in [JLS:4.3] include annotations, 
     but the grammar also includes rules for unannotated reference types 
     in [JLS:8.3] (for <span class="v">unann-reference-type</span> etc.). 
     Note, however, that also the rules for <span class="v">unann-reference-type</span> etc. 
     include some annotations in certain places.</p><p>As done in the <a href="JAVA____PRIMITIVE-TYPES.html">formalization of primitive types</a>, in our formalization of reference types it seems more practical 
     to define the `reference types' as the ones without annotations 
     (not even the ones in the rules for <span class="v">unann-reference-type</span> etc., 
     and have a separate notion for `annotated reference types'. 
     This is just nomenclature, the substance does not change.</p><p>For now we just define (unannotated) reference types. 
     Annotated reference types will be added later.</p>
