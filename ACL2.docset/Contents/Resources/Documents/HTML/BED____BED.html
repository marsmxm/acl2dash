<p>A Hons-based implementation of Boolean Expression Diagrams, described 
by Anderson and Hulgaard.</p><p>NOTE: this is a preliminary, work in progress.  We do not recommend 
using this library for anything, yet.</p> 
 
<p>In this library we represent BEDs using a Hons-based approach similar to 
<a href="ACL2____UBDDS.html">ACL2::ubdds</a> or <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">ACL2::aig</a>s.  You would ordinarily expect a BED to 
be represented as a DAG.  We instead use HONS to make the DAG explicit.  This 
allows us to refer to particular nodes in the graph as if they were individual 
expressions, and makes it much easier to reason about BEDs.  It is likely that 
an approach like <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">ACL2::aignet</a> could be used to develop a faster BED 
implementation, but we think this would be a lot more work.</p> 
 
<p>BEDs are a non-canonical representation.  The basic idea of our 
representation is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">Bed ::= Atom                     ; Terminal node
      | (VAR . (LEFT . RIGHT))   ; Variable ITE node
      | ((LEFT . RIGHT) . OP)    ; Binary operator node</pre> 
 
<p>In the "well-formed" case:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>All terminals are Booleans, i.e., <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>
</li> 
<li>The variable names are any ACL2 atoms</li> 
<li>The operators are valid <a href="BED____BED-OP-P.html">bed-op-p</a>s.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>But we don't have an explicit <span class="v">bed-p</span> recognizer and we can interpret any 
ACL2 object as a BED:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Any atom is coerced into a well-formed terminal using, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> x t
nil)</span>.</li> 
 
<li>Any improper operator is coerced into a <a href="BED____BED-OP-P.html">bed-op-p</a> using <a href="BED____BED-OP-FIX.html">bed-op-fix</a>.</li> 
 
<li>In any (var . atom) pair, the atom is interpreted as (nil . nil).</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This representation is a little goofy, but it has been carefully designed. 
Allowing any ACL2 object as a BED means that we don't need a <span class="v">bed-p</span> 
recognizer and can avoid memoized checks of beds for well-formedness.  Our 
goofy interpretation of the cons cases keeps each node to only two conses, 
without any ambiguity between variables and operators.  Finally, checking 
<span class="v">atom</span> is fast, so we can quickly distinguish variable from operator 
nodes.</p>
