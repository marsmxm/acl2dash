<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____GOOD-BYE">Click for Good-bye in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Quit entirely out of Lisp</p><pre class="code">Examples:
ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a>)
; [ACL2 is exited]

ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a> 3)
; [ACL2 is exited with Unix exit status 3]</pre> 
 
 <p>Note: Your entire session will disappear forever when you evaluate 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a>)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The command <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a>)</span> quits not only out of the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> 
 loop, but in fact quits entirely out of the underlying Lisp.  Thus, there is 
 no going back!  You will <b>not</b> be able to re-enter the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> 
 loop after typing <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a>)</span>!  All your work will be lost!!!</p> 
 
 <p>This command may not work in some underlying Common Lisp implementations. 
 In such cases, there is no harm in trying; ACL2 will let you know how to 
 proceed if it cannot exit.</p> 
 
 <p>In some systems, typing <span class="v">control-d</span> at the top-level ACL2 prompt 
 (<span class="v">control-c control-d</span> if inside emacs) will call this function.</p> 
 
 <p>The optional argument for <span class="v">good-bye</span> (default 0) indicates the 
 Unix (Linux) exit status.  If it is not an integer, it will be treated as 
 0.</p> 
 
 <p>If you merely want to exit the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> loop, use <span class="v">:q</span> 
 instead (see <a href="ACL2____Q.html">q</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude with the following technical remark, to be ignored unless you 
 are trying to do things in raw Lisp that involve quitting the session.  The 
 mechanism that ACL2 and Lisp use for quitting the session is slightly 
 involved.  In particular, if you trace the underlying raw Lisp function 
 <span class="v">exit-lisp</span>, you may see that it is called twice; the second call happens 
 while cleaning up from an <span class="v">unwind-protect</span> call.</p>
