<p>Arguments and Values:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">arglist -- an argument list satisfying ACL2::ARGLISTP, and containing
  exactly one symbol whose `print-name' is "L".

declaration -- any valid declaration.

documentation -- a string; not evaluated.

name -- a symbol.

theory-name -- any symbol that is a legal name for a deftheory event.

type-pair -- A pair (d . r) where d and r are either a function symbol
  or a one argument LAMBDA function or the constant T.
  d designates a predicate to be applied to each element of the domain
  of the alist, and r designates a predicate to be applied to each element
  of the range of the alist. T means no type restriction.

<h3>Description:</h3> 
 
<p>DEFALIST defines a recognizer for association lists whose pairs map 
  keys of a given type to values of a given type, and by default creates 
  an extensive theory for alists of the newly defined type.</p> 
 
<p>To define an alist type with DEFALIST you must supply a name for the alist 
  recognizer, an argument list for the recognizer, and predicate designator for 
  elements of the alist's range. The name may be any symbol.  The argument list 
  must be valid as a functional argument list, and must contain exactly one 
  symbol whose `print-name'is "L".  By convention this is the alist argument 
  recognized by the function defined by DEFALIST.</p> 
 
<p>The type of the domain and range of the alist is given by a pair (d . r) 
  where d identifies the type of an element of the alist's domain, and r 
  specifies the type of an element of the alist's range. Either of these 
  may be specified by a symbol which names a one-argument function (or macro) 
  which tests the elements of the domain and range of L. Either of d and r may 
  also be specified as a single-argument LAMBDA function. Finally, either of d 
  and r may be specified as the constant t, indicating no type constraint.</p> 
 
<p>Any number of other arguments to the alist functions may be supplied, 
  but only the L argument will change in the recursive structure of the recognizer.</p> 
 
<p>Note that DEFALIST does not create any guards for L or any other argument. 
  Guards may be specified in the usual way since any number of DECLARE forms 
  may preceed the predicate specification in the DEFALIST form.  Bear in mind 
  that if you are defining a function to be used as a guard, then you are 
  advised to consider what impact guarding the arguments of the function may 
  have on its utility.  In general the most useful guard functions are those 
  that are guard-free.</p> 
 
<h3>Theory</h3> 
 
<p>By default, DEFALIST creates an extensive theory for the recognized alists. 
  This theory contains appropriate lemmas for all of the alist functions 
  appearing in the `alist-functions' syntax description above.  One can select 
  a subset of this theory to be generated by using the :THEORY option 
  (see below).  DEFALIST always creates a :FORWARD-CHAINING rule from the 
  recognizer to ALISTP.</p> 
 
<p>DEFALIST also creates a DEFTHEORY event that lists all of the lemmas created 
  by the DEFALIST.  The name of the theory is formed by concatenating the 
  function name and the string "-THEORY", and INTERNing the resulting string 
  in the package of the function name.</p> 
 
<h3>Options</h3> 
 
<p>DEFALIST options are specified with a special :OPTIONS list systax.  If 
  present, the :OPTIONS list must appear as the last form in the body of the 
  DEFALIST.</p> 
 
<dl> 
<dt>:OMIT-DEFUN</dt> 
<dd>If the :OMIT-DEFUN keyword is present then the definition will not be 
    created.  Instead, only the list theory for the function is 
    generated. Use this option to create a list theory for recognizers 
    defined elsewhere.</dd> 
 
<dt>:THEORY</dt> 
<dd>This option is used to specify that only a subset of the list theory be 
   created.  In the STRINGP-LISTP example above we specify that only lemmas 
   about STRINGP-LISTP viz-a-viz NTH and PUT are to be generated.  By default 
   the complete list theory for the recognizer is created.  If the option is 
   given as (:THEORY) then the entire theory will be suppressed, 
   except for the :FORWARD-CHAINING rule from the recognizer to TRUE-LISTP.</dd> 
 
<dt>:BINDING-EQUAL-RULE-CLASSES</dt> 
<dd>This option specifies a value for the :RULE-CLASSES keyword for the 
   DEFTHM generated for the BINDING-EQUAL function (and for CDRASSOC) applied to 
   an alist recognized by the DEFALIST recognizer.  The default is :REWRITE.</dd> 
 
<dt>:DOMAIN-TYPE</dt> 
<dd>This option specifies a predicate that recognizes a list of domain elements. 
   It may be either a symbol or LAMBDA form. If present, and when not prevented 
   by a :THEORY specification, a rewrite rule for the type of the domain 
   will be generated. A lemma will be generated to check the compatibility 
   of the specified domain type and domain element type.</dd> 
 
<dt>:RANGE-TYPE</dt> 
<dd>This option specifies a predicate that recognizes a list of range elements. 
   It may be either a symbol or LAMBDA form. If present, and when not prevented 
   by a :THEORY specification, a rewrite rule for the type of the range 
   will be generated.  A lemma will be generated to check the compatibility 
   of the specified range type and domain element type.</dd> 
 
<dt>:THEORY-NAME</dt> 
<dd>This option allows the user to define the name of the deftheory event 
   that is automatically generated, and which includes the defthms that 
   are generated.</dd>
