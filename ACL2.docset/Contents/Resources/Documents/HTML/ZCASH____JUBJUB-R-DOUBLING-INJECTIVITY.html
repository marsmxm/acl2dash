<p>Injectivity of doubling in <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____JUBJUB-R-POINTP.html">jubjub-r-pointp</a></span>.</p><p>This is proved by cases on whether the points are zero or not. 
     The case in which they are both non-zero is the more complicated one:</p><ol>
<li>Assume 2P = 2Q.</li>
<li>Since P and Q have order r, 
      we have rP = O = rQ.</li>
<li>Since r is odd, r = 2k+1 for some integer k.</li>
<li>So from the equality at (2) we have 
      k(2P)+P = (2k+1)P = (2k+1)Q = k(2Q)+Q.</li>
<li>From the equality at (1), 
      we also have k(2P) = k(2Q) 
      and we can thus cancel them in the equality at (4), 
      obtaining P = Q.</li>
