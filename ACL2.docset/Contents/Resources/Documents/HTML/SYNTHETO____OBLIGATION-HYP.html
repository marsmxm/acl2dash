<p>Proof obligations arise from expressions 
     that may be contained in larger expressions. 
     In that case, the path from the super-expression to the sub-expression 
     may include boolean conditions (tests or negated tests) 
     as well as bindings: 
     these all provide hypotheses in which the proof obligation must be proved. 
     That a boolean condition is a hypothesis is obvious. 
     But note that also a binding can be regarded as a hypothesis of sorts, 
     because it introduces new variables and equates them to expressions: 
     both the new variables and the equations can be used 
     to prove the obligation.</p><p>This fixtype captures these two kinds of hypotheses 
     for proof obligations.</p>
