<p>A formalization of the ACL2 primitive functions.</p><p>The <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">ACL2 primitive functions</a>have no definitions. 
     Their evaluation semantics is described in the ACL2 documentation.</p><p>In order to formalize the evaluation semantics of ACL2, 
     we need to formalize the evaluation semantics of the primitive functions. 
     We do so ``directly'' here, 
     i.e. not via execution steps through evaluation states 
     as we do for defined functions.</p><p>Since our formalization of the ACL2 primitive functions 
     is written in the ACL2 logical language, 
     we make use the executable ACL2 primitive functions of the logical language 
     to formalize the ACL2 primitive functions of the ACL2 programming language. 
     However, note that the latter operate on our model of ACL2 values, 
     i.e. on the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2PL____VALUE.html">value</a></span> fixtype, 
     while the former operate on ACL2 values directly. 
     So there is a necessary indirection there, 
     due to the meta level nature of our formalization. 
     The treatment of symbol values is also slightly different, 
     because, as noted in the documentation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2PL____SYMBOL-VALUE.html">symbol-value</a></span>, 
     at the meta level we want to be able to talk about 
     all possible symbols for all possible known packages, 
     and not just the symbols for the packages that happen to be known 
     at the point in which we write this formalization.</p><p>Here we formalize the evaluation of the ACL2 primitive functions 
     in the logic, i.e. for all possible values, inside and outside the guards. 
     The treatment of values outside the guards 
     are according to the completion axioms shown in the documentation, 
     which amount to fixing the values to the required types.</p>
