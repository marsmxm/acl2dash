<p>Static shadowing checking of Yul.</p><p>According to [Yul: Specification of Yul: Scoping Rules], 
     a variable declaration cannot shadow a variable 
     that is visible at point in which the variable declaration occurs. 
     The notion of `visible' applies 
     not only to variables declared in outer blocks in the same function, 
     but also to variables declared in blocks in outer functions: 
     the former variables are accessible, while the latter are not.</p><p>The non-shadowing of outer variables in the same function 
     is checked as part of the safety checks 
     formalized in <a href="YUL____STATIC-SAFETY-CHECKING.html">static-safety-checking</a>. 
     This is necessary for safety, 
     because the dynamic semantics has 
     a single variable scope (not a stack of scopes).</p><p>The non-shadowing of outer variables in different functions 
     is not needed for safe execution, 
     because when the body of a function is executed, 
     a new variable scope is started, 
     and the function has no access to outside variables. 
     Nonetheless, it is part of the Yul static semantics: 
     the Yul team has explained that its purpose is 
     just to prevent human error. 
     Thus, we formalize these checks here, 
     separately from the safety checks.</p>
