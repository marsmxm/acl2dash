<p>C tag environments.</p><p>C code is statically checked and dynamically executed 
     in the context of structure, union, and enumeration types. 
     This context is captured via tag environments, 
     where `tag' refers to the fact that tags identify 
     structure, union, and enumeration types. 
     These tag environments are used 
     in both the static and dynamic semantics.</p>
