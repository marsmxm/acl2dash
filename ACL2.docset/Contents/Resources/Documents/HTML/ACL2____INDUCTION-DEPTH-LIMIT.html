<p>The maximum number permitted of nested inductions</p><p>ACL2 may limit the number of levels of induction.  Consider for 
 example a subgoal with this <a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Subgoal *1.2.3.1.2.3.1.2.3/7'11'</pre> 
 
 <p>This represents nine levels of induction.  By default, that is the maximum 
 permitted, since proofs rarely succeed with more than a few levels of 
 induction.  (Indeed, one is well served by relying on only one level of 
 induction, avoiding nested inductions in favor of proving suitable <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules.  See <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a>.)  Thus, if ACL2 would otherwise 
 attempt to push the subgoal indicated above for later proof by induction, the 
 overall proof would fail because that would cause the maximum nesting depth of 
 9 to be exceeded.</p> 
 
 <p>To see the current limit:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INDUCTION-DEPTH-LIMIT.html">induction-depth-limit</a> (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</pre> 
 
 <p>This limit is always a natural number, with one exception: it can be 
 <span class="v">nil</span>, which means that there is no limit on the nesting depth of 
 inductions.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that an explicit <span class="v">:induct</span> hint (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>) will cause an 
 induction to occur, regardless of the induction-depth-limit.  Of course, if 
 we have already reached the induction-depth-limit at the point the 
 <span class="v">:induct</span> hint is applied, then any attempt to push a subgoal for induction 
 will fail (unless it too has an associated <span class="v">:induct</span> hint).</p> 
 
 <p>To change the limit, see <a href="ACL2____SET-INDUCTION-DEPTH-LIMIT.html">set-induction-depth-limit</a>.</p>
