<p>Write an ACL2 object into a file</p><p>General form:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE-WRITE.html">serialize-write</a> filename obj
                 [:verbosep  {t, nil}])    ; nil by default
 --&gt;
state</pre> 
 
 <p>In the logic this carries out an oracle read.</p> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, we try to save <span class="v">obj</span> into the file indicated by 
 <span class="v">filename</span>, which must be a string.  The object can later be recovered with 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE-READ.html">serialize-read</a></span>.  We just return <span class="v">state</span>, and any failures (e.g., 
 file not openable) will result in a hard Lisp error.</p> 
 
 <p>Writing objects to disk is generally slower than reading them back in since 
 some analysis is required to convert an object into our <a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE.html">serialize</a>d 
 object format.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">verbosep</span> flag just says whether to print some low-level details 
 related to timing and memory usage as the file is being written.</p>
