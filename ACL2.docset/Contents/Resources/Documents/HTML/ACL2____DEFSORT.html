<p>Define a sorting function for a given comparator.</p><h5>NOTE: Defsort's interface has a greater than average likelihood of 
changing incompatibly in the future.</h5> 
 
<p>Defsort creates a relatively-high-performance sorting function for a given 
comparison function, and proves that its output is an ordered (with respect to 
the comparison function) permutation of the input list.  It is currently 
implemented as a mergesort on lists with some fixnum optimizations.</p> 
 
<p>It also may optionally prove the generated mergesort function equivalent to 
an insertion sort; this requires some extra properties to be proved about the 
comparison function beforehand; see the discussion of <span class="v">:weak</span> below.</p> 
 
<h3>Usage</h3> 
 
<p>These forms show various ways of invoking defsort:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSORT.html">defsort</a> sort-by-foo&lt;
         :prefix foosort
         :compare&lt; foo&lt;
         :comparablep foo-p
         :comparable-listp foolist-p
         :true-listp nil
         :weak t)

(<a href="ACL2____DEFSORT.html">defsort</a> :comparablep rationalp
         :compare&lt; &lt;
         :prefix &lt;
         :comparable-listp rational-listp
         :true-listp t
         :weak nil)

(<a href="ACL2____DEFSORT.html">defsort</a> intalist-sort
         :extra-args (alist)
         :extra-args-guard (intalistp alist)
         :compare&lt; intalist-&lt;
         :comparablep (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x alist) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a> x alist))))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFSORT.html">defsort</a> intalist-sort2 (x alist)
         :extra-args-guard (intalistp alist)
         :compare&lt; intalist2-&lt;
         :comparablep (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x alist) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a> x)))</pre> 
 
<p>The first form is a new syntax that gives the name of the sorting function 
explicitly; it is also good for etags generation since it is of the form 
<span class="v">(def... name ...)</span>.  In the first form, the prefix is optional; if it is 
not provided, the sort name will be used as the prefix for generating other 
function names.</p> 
 
<p>The second form shows an older syntax in which the sort name is omitted and 
every function name is generated from the prefix, so the name of the sorting 
function will in this case be <span class="v">&lt;-sort</span>.</p> 
 
<p>The third form shows the use of <span class="v">:extra-args</span> to define a parameterized 
sort.</p> 
 
<p>The fourth form shows a different syntax for specifying extra-args by giving 
a formals list before the keyword arguments, which looks a bit nicer.  (Note: 
In this syntax the first formal must be the symbol X, although it can be in any 
package.)  Additionally, it shows how to use extra-args in conjunction with a 
comparablep predicate that doesn't use them.</p> 
 
<h4>Keyword Arguments</h4> 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:compare&lt;</span> gives the function to use to compare elements; this may be a 
binary function name or a lambda such as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> y x))</span>.  Defsort 
needs to prove that this is a transitive relation.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:prefix</span> defaults to the sort name when it is provided, but otherwise 
is required.  It is used to generate function and theorem names.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:comparablep</span> gives the type of element to be compared.  The comparison 
function's guards should be satisfied by any two elements that both satisfy 
this predicate.  This may be a unary function symbol or lambda.  If it is 
omitted, then it is treated as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x) t)</span>, i.e. all objects are 
comparable.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:comparable-listp</span> gives the name of a function that recognizes a list 
of comparable elements.  This may be omitted, in which case such a function 
will be defined (named <span class="v">&lt;prefix&gt;-list-p</span>).</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:true-listp</span> defaults to NIL and determines whether the 
comparable-listp function requires the final cdr to be NIL.  If an existing 
<span class="v">:comparable-listp</span> function name is provided, then the value of 
<span class="v">:true-listp</span> must correspond to that function; i.e. true-listp must be true 
iff the comparable-listp function requires the final cdr to be nil.  If 
<span class="v">:comparable-listp</span> is not provided, then the comparable-listp function will 
be generated so that this is true.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:weak</span> defaults to NIL in the new syntax and T in the old syntax, for 
historical reasons.  When <span class="v">:weak</span> is NIL, defsort will introduce a simple 
insertion sort function in addition to the optimized mergesort, and prove the 
two equivalent.  To do this, it needs a couple of extra facts about the 
comparison function, in addition to its transitivity: its negation must also be 
a transitive relation, and it must be strict, i.e., 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (compare&lt; x x))</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:extra-args</span> may be a list of variables that are used as extra 
parameters to all the functions involved.  (If some of your functions don't 
require all the arguments, you must wrap them in a lambda in order to accept 
the right arguments.)  When using the new syntax with a formals list, 
extra-args is not accepted since the formals list already specifies them.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:extra-args-guard</span> may be a term giving a guard that will be required 
of the extra-args.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h5>Troubleshooting</h5> 
 
<p>Defsort allows you to specify a lambda rather than a function for most 
arguments, and doesn't require that (e.g.) the <span class="v">:extra-args-guard</span> be just a 
function call.  But things may break if you use, e.g., a lambda containing an 
IF (or AND or OR) as, say, the comparablep predicate.  It is best for 
everything to be a simple function call.</p> 
 
<p>There may also be some bad cases when the setting of <span class="v">:comparablep</span> is a 
built-in function that ACL2 treats specially or that is in <span class="v">minimal-theory</span>. 
For example, <span class="v">:comparablep atom</span> used to cause defsort to fail, though now 
it has a special hack for that particular case.</p>
