<p>Old name for <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a></p><p>See <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>.  Historically, this tool was misnamed the 
 ``proof-checker'', but since the tool is used for building and exploring (what 
 could be called) proofs rather than for checking them, its name was changed to 
 ``proof-builder'' in 2016.</p>
