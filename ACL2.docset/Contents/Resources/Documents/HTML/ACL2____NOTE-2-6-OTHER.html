<p>ACL2 Version  2.6 Notes on Other (Minor) Changes</p><p>Warning strings are now case-insensitive.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 causes a warning when an <a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> hint or event causes a 0-ary 
 function's definition to be disabled but its <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span> to be enabled.</p> 
 
 <p>A minor modification has been made to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> that can have a 
 positive impact on performance in Allegro Common Lisp.  (For Lisp hackers: the 
 stobj name was formerly declared special, and that was disabling Allegro's 
 tail-merging routing for compilation of some recursive functions using 
 stobjs.)  The downside is that stobj names can no longer be evaluated in raw 
 Lisp.  However, raw Lisp is not the right place to be evaluating ACL2 forms 
 anyhow; see <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a>.  We thank Rob Sumners for bringing this issue 
 to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Before Version 2.6, there has been the following problem with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> in the case that the current package is not 
 the ACL2 package.  If a <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> was specified using the symbol 
 <span class="v">=&gt;</span>, then that symbol had have been imported into the current package from 
 the ACL2 package when the current package was defined.  There are no longer 
 any package restrictions on the use of <span class="v">=&gt;</span>.  Thanks to John Cowles for 
 bringing this problem to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Bugs in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> have been fixed.  <span class="v">Defun-sk</span> forms introducing 
 functions of no arguments were failing to be admitted, for example: 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> always-p1 () (<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (x) (p1 x)))</span>.  Thanks to John Cowles for 
 bringing this problem to our attention.  Also, <span class="v">defun-sk</span> failed on an 
 example in the documentation (see <a href="ACL2____TUTORIAL4-DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">tutorial4-defun-sk-example</a>), as 
 pointed out by Matyas Sustik; this bug has been fixed as well.</p> 
 
 <p>The trace mechanism has been fixed to handle <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s, and to avoid 
 the printing of so-called <i>enabled structures</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a></span> command <span class="v">:type-alist</span> now produces more readable 
 output.</p> 
 
 <p>An <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> of an uncertified book no longer loads an 
 associated compiled file.</p> 
 
 <p>We added a few checks to make sure that the underlying lisp is suitable, 
 for example checking that the reader is case-insensitive and reads in symbols 
 with upper-case names where appropriate.</p> 
 
 <p>We now warn when forcing (see <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>) or immediate force mode (see 
 <a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a>) change state between enabled and disabled.  Also 
 see <a href="ACL2____ENABLE-IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">enable-immediate-force-modep</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DISABLE-IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">disable-immediate-force-modep</a> for information about these new macros, which 
 may be used to control immediate force mode.</p> 
 
 <p>We have eliminated the use of a low-level raw Lisp constant, 
 <span class="v">*most-recent-multiplicity*</span>.  Our test suite saw a speed-up of 
 approximately 2% as a result for an ACL2 image built on GCL (but no 
 significant speed-up for an ACL2 image built on Allegro Common Lisp).  We 
 thank Rob Sumners for suggesting this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixnum declarations are now realized as <span class="v">(signed-byte 29)</span> instead of 
 <span class="v">(signed-byte 27)</span>.  We check that the underlying Common Lisp recognizes 
 objects of type <span class="v">(signed-byte 29)</span> as fixnums, with the exception of CLISP, 
 which is said to have an efficient bignum implementation.</p> 
 
 <p>A new documentation topic <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION-EXAMPLE.html">functional-instantiation-example</a> 
 illustrates functional instantiation.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug has been fixed in the monitoring of runes (see <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>). 
 Thanks to Dave Greve for sending an example that clearly showed the 
 problem.</p> 
 
 <p>A warning is now issued when it is detected that a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule may not be as strong as it appears because it is not 
 sufficient to prove itself by type reasoning.</p> 
 
 <p>An error is caused for rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> when the function 
 symbol <span class="v">IF</span> is among the <span class="v">:trigger-fns</span>.  (<span class="v">IF</span> was ignored anyhow; 
 the point of this change is to avoid misleading the user.)</p> 
 
 <p>A minor bug has been fixed in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span>, evident for example if this 
 command was applied to <span class="v">IF</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A minor hole in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-BOGUS-MUTUAL-RECURSION-OK.html">set-bogus-mutual-recursion-ok</a></span> did not permit 
 the acceptance of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> forms that include constant 
 function definitions.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to Eric Smith for coming 
 up with a simple example illustrating the problem.</p> 
 
 <p>The temporary files "TMP.lisp" and "TMP1.lisp" written out by 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span> are now written to the connected book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Previously, the Allegro compiler was not eliminating tail recursion for 
 executable counterparts of functions, because of the way one of its flags had 
 been set.  As a result, calls of functions whose guards had not been verified 
 could run out of stack space when this was not necessary.  This situation has 
 been fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>Executable counterparts could have slow array accesses.  This has been 
 fixed (specifically, constants are no longer replaced with their values in the 
 definitions of executable counterparts).</p> 
 
 <p>Various improvements have been made to the documentation.  Thanks in 
 particular to Eric Smith for pointing out a numbers of places where fixes were 
 in order.</p> 
 
 <p>File "mcl-acl2-startup.lisp" has been updated, thanks to feedback from 
 Philippe Georgelin.</p> 
 
 <p>Inefficiencies in GCL fixnum computations were remedied for macros <span class="v">+f</span> 
 and <span class="v">*f</span>.  Thanks to Rob Sumners for pointing out this issue.</p>
