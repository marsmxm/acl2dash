<p><span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH_____A2UNCOMMITTED-SAPLING_A2.html">*uncommitted-sapling*</a></span> is not 
          in the image of <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____PEDERSEN.html">pedersen</a></span>.</p><p>This was Theorem 5.4.2 in certain earlier versions of [ZPS], 
     such as version 2020.1.0. 
     Later versions of [ZPS] have similar theorems, 
     but not quite the same. 
     In any case, this property still holds, and it is proved here.</p><p>The theorem is of interest when <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____PEDERSEN.html">pedersen</a></span> returns a good hash, 
     which requires <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____PEDERSEN-POINT.html">pedersen-point</a></span> to return a Jubjub point. 
     However, since our definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____PEDERSEN.html">pedersen</a></span> 
     returns <span class="v">nil</span> when <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____PEDERSEN-POINT.html">pedersen-point</a></span> does not return a point, 
     this theorem holds unconditionally.</p><p>We first prove the case in which <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____PEDERSEN-POINT.html">pedersen-point</a></span> returns a point, 
     and we use the definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH_____A2UNCOMMITTED-SAPLING_A2.html">*uncommitted-sapling*</a></span> in this lemma. 
     This is critical for 
     the injectivity theorem of <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____I2LEBSP.html">i2lebsp</a></span> to apply, 
     which reduces the goal to the inequality of 
     the abscissa of a Jubjub point with 1, 
     which is false by <span class="tt"><a href="ZCASH____JUBJUB-POINT-ABSCISSA-IS-NOT-1.html">jubjub-point-abscissa-is-not-1</a></span>. 
     The latter theorem is disabled, 
     but it appears that ACL2's tau system makes use of it.</p>
