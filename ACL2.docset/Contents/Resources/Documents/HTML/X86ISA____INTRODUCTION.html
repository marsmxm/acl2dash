<p>A Formal and Executable Model of the x86 Instruction Set 
  Architecture</p><p>These books contain the specification of x86 instruction 
 set architecture (ISA); we characterize x86 machine instructions and 
 model the instruction fetch, decode, and execute process using the 
 ACL2 theorem-proving system.  We use our x86 ISA specification to 
 formally verify x86 machine-code programs.</p> 
 
 <p>These books include:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>A formal, executable x86 ISA model (see <span class="v">machine</span> 
 sub-directory)</li> 
 
 <li>General theorems to aid in machine-code verification (see 
 <span class="v">proofs/utilities</span> sub-directory)</li> 
 
 <li>Examples of using these books to verify some programs (see 
  <span class="v">proofs</span> sub-directory)</li> 
 
 </ul>

 <h3>Completeness of the x86 Model</h3> 
 
 <p>The utility of a formal ISA model for performing machine-code 
 verification depends directly on the model's completeness (with 
 respect to the ISA features specified), accuracy, and reasoning and 
 execution efficiency.  <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html" target="_blank"><nobr>Intel 
 software developer's manuals<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/processors/architectures-software-developer-manuals.html"></nobr></a> were used as specification documents, 
 and ambiguities were resolved by cross-referencing <a href="https://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/" target="_blank"><nobr>AMD 
 manuals<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://developer.amd.com/resources/developer-guides-manuals/"></nobr></a> and running tests on real machines to understand processor 
 behavior. </p> 
 
 <p>The current focus of these books is Intel's <b>IA-32e mode</b>, which 
 includes 64-bit and Compatibility sub-modes, and the <b>32-bit protected 
 mode</b>.</p>

 <h3>Reasoning and Execution Efficiency</h3> 
 
 <p>These books contain a formal x86 ISA model that is not only 
 capable of reasoning about x86 machine-code programs, but also of 
 simulating those programs. See <a href="X86ISA____PROGRAM-EXECUTION.html">program-execution</a> for 
 instructions on how to set up the <span class="v">x86isa</span> model for executing a 
 program.</p> 
 
 <p>Reasoning efficiency is desirable to make code proofs tractable 
 and execution efficiency is desirable to enable faster model 
 validation via co-simulations (See <a href="X86ISA____MODEL-VALIDATION.html">model-validation</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>However, simple definitions that are suitable for reasoning 
 typically offer poor execution performance and definitions optimized 
 for execution efficiency often use a sufficiently different algorithm 
 from the one used in the specification that they are difficult to 
 reason about.  However, ACL2 offers several features to mitigate this 
 trade-off between reasoning and execution efficiency.  For e.g.: <a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a> and its friends like <a href="ACL2____MBT.html">mbt</a>, and <a href="ACL2____ASSERT_A2.html">assert*</a>, 
 <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">ACL2::stobj</a>, and <a href="ACL2____DEFABSSTOBJ.html">defabsstobj</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 features like abstract stobjs and <span class="v">assert*</span> were a 
 response by the ACL2 authors to provide mechanisms to mitigate the 
 complexity of reasoning vs. execution efficiency that came up over 
 the course of this project.  This x86 ISA model uses abstract stobjs 
 to layer the state of the x86 machine such that the lower layer 
 (i.e., the concrete stobj) can be optimized for execution 
 efficiency and the upper layer (i.e., the abstract stobj) can be 
 optimized for reasoning efficiency, while a correspondence theorem is 
 proved to hold between these two layers at all times.  Therefore, we 
 get the benefit of both fast execution and effective reasoning.</p> 
 
 <h3>Modes of Operation</h3> 
 
 <p>The complexity of the x86 ISA model will increase as more features are 
 added to it, and this added complexity will make reasoning inevitably more 
 involved.  The issue of balancing <i>verification effort</i> and 
 <i>verification utility</i> is a very pertinent one.  For example, users might 
 not want to reason about an application program at the level of physical 
 memory, i.e., taking into account address translations and access rights 
 management provided by the memory management data structures.  This is because 
 it is customary for application programs not to have direct access to the 
 system data structures.  The memory model seen by 64-bit application programs 
 is that of linear memory, which is an OS-constructed abstraction of the 
 complicated underlying memory management mechanisms like paging that are based 
 on physical memory.  Therefore, verification of application programs can be 
 performed at the level of linear memory, if the OS routines that manage the 
 linear memory abstraction can be either trusted or proved correct.  However, 
 the verification of system programs, like kernel routines, must necessarily be 
 done at the level of physical memory since these programs can access/modify 
 system data structures.</p> 
 
 <p>In light of the above, the x86 ISA model provides the option to 
 deactivate some features of the ISA, enabling the user to do two 
 kinds of analysis, depending on the kind of programs being considered 
 for verification.  Specifically, the model offers the following views 
 of x86 machines:</p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li>
<b>Application-Level View:</b> <p>In this view, the model 
 attempts to provide the same environment for reasoning as is provided 
 by an OS for programming.  It allows the verification of an 
 application program while assuming that memory management, I/O 
 operations, and services offered via system calls are provided 
 reliably by the underlying OS.  The memory model here supports 64-bit 
 linear addresses specified for IA-32e machines.  A specification of 
 system calls like <span class="v">read</span>, <span class="v">write</span>, <span class="v">open</span>, and <span class="v">close</span> is 
 also included in this view.</p>
</li> 
 
 <li>
<b>System-level View:</b> <p>This view includes the specification 
 for IA-32e paging and segmentation; in particular, ISA-prescribed 
 data structures for memory management and (partial) specifications of 
 system-mode instructions like LLDT and LGDT are available in this 
 mode.  The memory model here characterizes a 52-bit physical address 
 space, which is the largest physical address space provided by modern 
 x86 implementations.  This view is intended to be used to simulate 
 and verify software that has supervisor privileges and interacts with 
 I/O devices.</p> </li> 
 
 </ol> 
 
 <p>An added benefit of having these two separate views is the 
 increased execution speed of programs in the application-level view; 
 this is because executing these programs in this view does not 
 require simulating both the physical address space (and hence, 
 accesses/updates to the paging data structures) and the linear 
 address space.</p> 
 
 <p>It would be beneficial, not to mention interesting, to verify 
 whether the application-level view is an abstraction of the 
 system-level view, given that the system data structures have been set 
 up correctly.  As of now, establishing this relationship between the 
 two modes is out of the scope of this project.</p>
