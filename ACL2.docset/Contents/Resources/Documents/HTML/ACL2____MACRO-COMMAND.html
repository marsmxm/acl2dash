<p>Compound command for the interactive proof-builder</p><p>The interactive <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> supports the definition of 
 compound commands, called ``macro commands'', which expand into zero or more 
 other commands.  Some of these are ``atomic'' macro commands; these are viewed 
 as a single command step when completed successfully.</p> 
 
 <p>More <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> may be written on the interactive <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>.  For now, we simply point out that there are lots of examples 
 of the use of <span class="v">define-pc-macro</span> and <span class="v">define-pc-atomic-macro</span> in the ACL2 
 source file <span class="v">"proof-builder-b.lisp"</span>.  The former is used to create macro 
 commands, which can be submitted to the interactive loop (see <a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">verify</a>) 
 and will ``expand'' into zero or more commands.  The latter is similar, except 
 that the undoing mechanism (see <a href="ACL2-PC____UNDO.html">ACL2-pc::undo</a>) understands atomic macro 
 commands to represent single interactive commands.  Also see <a href="ACL2-PC____COMM.html">ACL2-pc::comm</a> and see <a href="ACL2-PC____COMMANDS.html">ACL2-pc::commands</a> for a discussion of the 
 display of interactive commands.</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____TOGGLE-PC-MACRO.html">toggle-pc-macro</a> for how to change a macro command to an 
 atomic macro command, and vice versa.</p>
