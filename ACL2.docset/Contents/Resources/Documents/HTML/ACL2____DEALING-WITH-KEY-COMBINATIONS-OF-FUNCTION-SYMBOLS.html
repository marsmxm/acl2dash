<p>How to get rid of key combinations of function symbols</p><p>Suppose <span class="v">REV</span> reverses a list, <span class="v">MEMBER</span> checks that its first 
 argument is an element of its second, and <span class="v">SQUARES-PLUS-3P</span> is some 
 complicated predicate.  Suppose you're proving some Main Theorem that involves 
 those concepts and the theorem prover presents you with the following hideous 
 formula as a key checkpoint.  What action should you take?</p> 
 
 <p>Hint: Don't read the formula ``for sense,'' i.e., don't try to understand 
 what this formula is saying!  Just look at every subterm involving a nest of 
 two function symbols and ask if you know something about those two symbols 
 that allows you to <i>simplify</i> that one subterm.</p>

         (SQUARES-PLUS-3P K (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> X)))?</pre> 
 
 <p>The experienced ACL2 user will stop reading at the second hypothesis!</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 3 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> I I)) (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> X))</pre> 
 
 <p>The combination of <span class="v">MEMBER</span> and <span class="v">REV</span> can be simplified.  The 
 question ``is <span class="v">e</span> a member of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> x)</span>'' can be answered by asking ``is 
 <span class="v">e</span> a member of <span class="v">x</span>''.  The two questions are equivalent.  This insight 
 comes from your intuition about the <i>semantics</i> of <span class="v">REV</span> — it 
 just reorders the elements but doesn't add or delete any.  The second question 
 is simpler since it doesn't mention <span class="v">REV</span>, so this is a good transformation 
 to make.  And the theorem that they are equivalent is simpler than the key 
 checkpoint above because it involves fewer functions and smaller 
 expressions.</p> 
 
 <p>You might formalize this insight as</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x))
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x))</pre> 
 
 <p>But this conjecture is <i>not</i> a theorem, because <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x)</span> 
 returns the <span class="v">cdr</span> of <span class="v">x</span> that begins with <span class="v">e</span>, not just a Boolean 
 (<span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>) indicating whether <span class="v">e</span> is an element of <span class="v">x</span>.  The 
 location of the first <span class="v">e</span> in <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x)</span> is generally different than the 
 location in <span class="v">x</span>.  So when we say the two questions are ``equivalent'' we 
 don't mean they are equal.  We mean that they're propositionally equivalent: 
 both <span class="v">nil</span> or both non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  This sense of equivalence is called ``if 
 and only if'' and is checked by the function <span class="v">iff</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>So our intuitive insight can be phrased as this theorem:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x))
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x))</pre> 
 
 <p>Suggesting that this formulation of the insight is ``obvious'' begs many 
 questions.  Mathematically, we could have avoided <span class="v">iff</span> and just written 
 two implications:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x)))
     (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x))).</pre> 
 
 <p>or</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x)))
     (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x))  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x))))).</pre> 
 
 <p>Or we could have used <span class="v">iff</span> but ``oriented'' it the other way:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x)
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>We choose to write</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x))
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x))</pre> 
 
 <p>because of <i>our knowledge of how ACL2 turns formulas into rules!</i></p> 
 
 <p>We deal with this at greater length later.  But just to drive the point 
 home, if we issue the command:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> member-rev
  (<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x))
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 will build in a rule that causes every propositional occurrence of 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> x))</span> to be replaced by <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> e x)</span>.  (By 
 ``propositional occurrence'' we mean an occurrence in which the value is 
 tested, as by <span class="v">IF</span> or the propositional connectives.  Remember, one might 
 use <span class="v">member</span> to determine the location of an element too.)</p> 
 
 <p>Note carefully: <i>if you do not tell ACL2 how to make a rule</i> from a 
 theorem, it makes a rewrite rule.  Rewrite rules always replace instances of 
 the left-hand side by the corresponding instances of the right-hand side. 
 That is, when interpreted as a rewrite rule, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> </span><i>alpha</i> 
 <i>beta</i><span class="v">)</span> makes ACL2 replace <i>alpha</i> by <i>beta</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>Probably the biggest mistake new users make is forgetting that every 
 theorem they prove creates a very specific rule.  You must remember that you 
 are <i>programming</i> ACL2 with these rules.  Being careless in your 
 statement of theorems is tantamount to being careless in your programming. 
 What you get is a mess.</p> 
 
 <p>Had we proved the same equivalence, but with the <span class="v">iff</span> commuted, we 
 would be giving ACL2 <i>bad advice</i>.  We would be telling it ``replace 
 instances of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> e x)</span> by the corresponding instances of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> e
 (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> x))</span>''!  If ACL2 had that rule and ever tried to simplify any 
 <span class="v">member</span> expression, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> A B)</span>, it would get into an infinite 
 loop, e.g., producing the following sequence of transformations:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> A B)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> A (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> B))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> A (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> B)))
...</pre> 
 
 <p>until it eventually exhausted some resource.</p> 
 
 <p>Recall that we entertained the idea of phrasing our insight about 
 <span class="v">member</span> and <span class="v">rev</span> with implications rather than <span class="v">iff</span>.  Generally 
 speaking, implications produce weaker rules — rules that apply less 
 often.  We discuss that later.</p> 
 
 <p>Now suppose we've proved <span class="v">member-rev</span>, oriented so as to rewrite 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x))</span> to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x)</span>, and built it in as a rewrite 
 rule.  Then suppose we repeated the attempt to prove our Main Theorem.  This 
 time, when the prover is processing the hideous Key Checkpoint printed above, 
 our new lemma, <span class="v">member-rev</span>, will hit it.  It will transform the formula 
 to:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 3 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> I I)) X)   ; &lt;-- the hyp has simplified
              (LIST-OF-INTEGERS X)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">INTEGERP</a> I)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> 0 I)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">INTEGERP</a> K)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> 0 K)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> I K)
              (SQUARES-PLUS-3P K X)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 3 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> I I))))
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 3 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> I I)) X)))
         (SQUARES-PLUS-3P K (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">REV</a> X)))?</pre> 
 
 <p>and then that will collapse to <span class="v">T</span>, since the <span class="v">IMPLIES</span> has 
 contradictory hypotheses (note the last hypothesis above).</p> 
 
 <p>By proving <span class="v">member-rev</span> we proved the hideous checkpoint.  We never had 
 to look at the rest of the formula or think about why it is a theorem. 
 Furthermore, attacking the main theorem again, from scratch, with 
 <span class="v">member-rev</span> in the database, may eliminate other checkpoints that came up 
 the last time we tried to prove our main goal.  So we recommend addressing one 
 checkpoint at a time.</p> 
 
 <p>This example illustrates that purely <i>local</i> thinking — looking 
 for simplifiable combinations of function symbols — can sometimes lead 
 to proofs and should always be your first reaction to a key checkpoint: what 
 local fact do you know that would clean up the formula?  Don't think about 
 deep questions like ``why is this true?'' until you can't see any way to make 
 it simpler.</p> 
 
 <p>It is important to train yourself to see combinations of function symbols 
 and to create strong rules for eliminating them.  We will give you 
 opportunities to practice this later in the tutorial.</p>
