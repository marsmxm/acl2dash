<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=VL2014____HTML-ENCODING">Click for Html-encoding in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Routines to encode HTML entities such as <span class="v">&lt;</span> and <span class="v">&amp;</span> into 
<span class="v">&amp;lt;</span>, <span class="v">&amp;amp;</span>, etc.</p><p>In principle, this conversion may not be entirely legitimate in the 
sense of any particular HTML specification, since ACL2 strings might contain 
non-printable characters or other similarly unlikely garbage.  But it seems 
like what we implement is pretty reasonable.</p> 
 
<p>We convert newline characters into the sequence <span class="v">&lt;br/&gt;#Newline</span>.  This 
may not be the desired behavior in certain applications, but is very convenient 
for what we are trying to accomplish in VL.</p>
