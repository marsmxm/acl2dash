<p>Intel Opcodes Supported in <span class="v">x86isa</span></p><p>We support decoding of all the x86 instructions in the one-, two-, and 
 three-byte opcode maps, including the AVX/AVX2/AVX512 extensions.  However, a 
 fraction of those are actually implemented in this model --- when we say 
 <i>implemented</i> instructions, we mean instructions that have a semantic function 
 that models its effects on the machine's state.</p> 
 
 <p>For a listing of all such supported instructions, see <a href="X86ISA____ONE-BYTE-OPCODES-MAP.html">one-byte-opcodes-map</a>, <a href="X86ISA____TWO-BYTE-OPCODES-MAP.html">two-byte-opcodes-map</a>, <a href="X86ISA____0F-38-THREE-BYTE-OPCODES-MAP.html">0f-38-three-byte-opcodes-map</a>, and <a href="X86ISA____0F-3A-THREE-BYTE-OPCODES-MAP.html">0f-3a-three-byte-opcodes-map</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For a readable version of all the opcode maps, see constants like 
  <span class="v">*pre-one-byte-opcode-map*</span> in the book <span class="v">inst-listing.lisp</span>.  These are 
  the constants to edit in order to add new instructions, etc. in the future. 
  The dispatch, modr/m and prefixes computation, and generation of 
  documentation is done automatically from these constants.</p>
