<p>Symbolic versions of the SV <a href="SV____FUNCTIONS.html">functions</a> that operate on <a href="SV____A4VEC.html">a4vec</a>s instead of <a href="SV____4VEC.html">4vec</a>s.</p><p>These operations form the core of our support for <a href="SV____BIT-BLASTING.html">bit-blasting</a> SV <a href="SV____EXPRESSIONS.html">expressions</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Our basic goal here is to provide efficient <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">ACL2::aig</a>-based 
implementations of all of the SV <a href="SV____FUNCTIONS.html">functions</a>.  It is generally important 
for these functions to produce small AIGs so that we will produce simpler, 
smaller problems for back-end tools like SAT solvers and BDD packages to 
process.</p> 
 
<p>These are many functions to implement, but most of this is straightforward 
and we can substantially reuse our functions for <a href="SV____AIG-SYMBOLIC-ARITHMETIC.html">aig-symbolic-arithmetic</a>, extending them as appropriate to deal with our 
four-valued logic.</p> 
 
<p>A few functions with fancier implementations include <a href="SV____A4VEC-CONCAT.html">a4vec-concat</a>, 
which is reused in <a href="SV____A4VEC-ZERO-EXT.html">a4vec-zero-ext</a> and <a href="SV____A4VEC-SIGN-EXT.html">a4vec-sign-ext</a>, and also 
the shifting operations <a href="SV____A4VEC-RSH.html">a4vec-rsh</a> and <a href="SV____A4VEC-LSH.html">a4vec-lsh</a>.  Each of these 
take some special measures to try to avoid creating catastrophically large 
vectors.</p>
