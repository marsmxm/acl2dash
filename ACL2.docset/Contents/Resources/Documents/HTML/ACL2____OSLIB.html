<p>Operating System Utilities Library</p><p>This is a collection of ACL2 functions that allow you to do various 
basic operating-system related tasks, e.g., you can get the current PID or user 
name, file listings, etc.</p> 
 
<p>Almost everything here necessarily requires a trust tag, because it is 
implemented in raw Lisp.  We believe we have connected this functionality to 
ACL2 in a sound way, using <a href="ACL2____READ-ACL2-ORACLE.html">read-ACL2-oracle</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The library is far from complete since we tend to extend it only as the need 
arises.  Most functions are not implemented on all Lisp and operating system 
combinations, and will simply fail on unsupported Lisps.</p> 
 
<p>Please regard oslib as somewhat experimental.  In the near future we may try 
to standardize the interfaces of oslib functions to make them more 
predictable.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Loading the library</h3> 
 
<p>You can load the full library with:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "oslib/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>But you can alternately just pick out the specific books that you want to 
load.  The library has been arranged so that you can load only the logical 
definitions without loading their associated raw Lisp code.  For instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "oslib/argv" :dir :system)
  ;; -- requires a ttag, loads (<a href="OSLIB____ARGV.html">argv</a>) and its raw Lisp code

(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "oslib/argv-logic" :dir :system)
  ;; -- gets the logical definition of (<a href="OSLIB____ARGV.html">argv</a>)
  ;; -- no ttag, but of course the resulting (<a href="OSLIB____ARGV.html">argv</a>) won't work yet</pre> 
 
<p>Some users may find this to be useful, e.g., you can avoid trust tags in the 
vast majority of your books, and only include the actual oslib raw Lisp code 
when you're ready to run your ACL2 programs.</p> 
 
<p>This paradigm is followed throughout the library.  For instance, you can load 
all oslib functions (without trust tags) using:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "oslib/top-logic" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>But the resulting definitions won't work until you include the regular 
<span class="v">top</span> book.</p>
