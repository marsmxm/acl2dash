<p>Formatted printing</p><p>ACL2 provides the functions <span class="v">fmt</span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT1.html">fmt1</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a></span> 
 as substitutes for Common Lisp's <span class="v">format</span> function.  Also see <a href="ACL2____FMT_12.html">fmt!</a>, 
 see <a href="ACL2____FMT1_12.html">fmt1!</a>, and see <a href="ACL2____FMS_12.html">fms!</a> for versions of these functions that 
 write forms to files in a manner that allows them to be read, by avoiding 
 using backslash (<span class="v">\</span>) to break long lines.  There are also analogues of 
 these functions that return a string without taking <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> as an 
 argument; see <a href="ACL2____PRINTING-TO-STRINGS.html">printing-to-strings</a>.  A convenient macro, <span class="v">fmx</span>, is 
 described below; also see <a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> and see <a href="ACL2____FMX-CW.html">fmx-cw</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>All three print a given string under an alist pairing character objects 
 with values, interpreting certain ``tilde-directives'' in the string. 
 <span class="v">Channel</span> must be a character output channel (e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2STANDARD-CO_A2.html">*standard-co*</a></span>).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms:                                            result
(<a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a> string alist channel state evisc-tuple)         ; state

 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMS.html">Fms</a></span> and <span class="v">fmt</span> print an initial newline to put <span class="v">channel</span> in 
 column <span class="v">0</span>; <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT1.html">Fmt1</a></span> requires the current column as input.  Columns are 
 numbered from <span class="v">0</span>.  The current column is the column into which the next 
 character will be printed.  (Thus, the current column number is also the 
 number of <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> printed since the last newline.)  The <span class="v">col</span> 
 returned by <span class="v">fmt</span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT1.html">fmt1</a></span> is the current column at the conclusion 
 of the formatting.  <span class="v">Evisc-tuple</span> must be either <span class="v">nil</span> (meaning no 
 abbreviations are used when objects are printed) or an ``evisceration tuple''; 
 see <a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We list the tilde-directives below.  The notation is explained after the 
 chart.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">~xx  pretty print vx (maybe after printing a newline)
~yx  pretty print vx starting in current column; end with newline
~Xxy like ~xx but use vy as the evisceration tuple
~Yxy like ~yx but use vy as the evisceration tuple
~@x  if vx is a string, "str",  recursively format "str"
     if vx is ("str" . a), recursively format "str" under a+
~#x~[...~/...~/ ... ~/...~] cases on vx
     ^    ^     ...   ^  if 0&lt;=vx&lt;=k, choose vxth alternative
     0    1     ...   k  if vx is a list of length 1, case 0; else 1
~*x  iterator: vx must be of the form
     ("str0" "str1" "str2" "str3" lst . a);
     if lst is initially empty, format "str0" under a+; otherwise,
     bind #\* successively to the elements of lst and then
     recursively format "stri" under a+, where i=1 if there is one
     element left to process, i=2 if there are two left, and i=3
     otherwise.
~&amp;x  print elements of vx with ~x, separated by commas and a
     final ``and''
~vx  print elements of vx with ~x, separated by commas and a
     final ``or''
~nx  if vx is a small positive integer, print it as a word, e.g.,
     seven;
     if vx is a singleton containing a small positive integer, print
       the corresponding ordinal as a word, e.g., seventh
~Nx  like ~nx but the word is capitalized, e.g., Seven or Seventh
~tx  tab out to column vx; newline first if at or past column vx
~cx  vx is (n . w), print integer n right justified in field of
     width w
~fx  print object vx flat over as many lines as necessary
~Fx  same as ~f, except that subsequent lines are indented to
     start one character to the right of the first character printed
~sx  if vx is a symbol, print vx, breaking on hyphens (unless the
     symbol would normally be printed with surrounding vertical bar
     characters (|), in which case print as with ~fx); if vx is a
     string, print the characters in it, breaking on hyphens; else
     vx is a number, to be printed using the current print-base and
     print-radix
~Sx  same as ~s, except that margins are ignored (hence no breaking on
     hyphens and no breaking when the column exceeds the value of
     the hard right-margin)
~    tilde space: print a space
~_x  print vx spaces
~
     tilde newline: skip following whitespace
~%   output a newline
~|   output a newline unless already on left margin
~~   print a tilde
~-   if close to right margin, output a hyphen and newline; else
     skip this char</pre> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">x</span> is a character, then <span class="v">vx</span> is the value of <span class="v">#\x</span> under the 
 current alist.  Consider for example the discussion above for <span class="v">~y</span>, 
 ``<span class="v">~yx pretty print vx</span>'', applied to the following expression: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a>
 "HELLO ~y7" (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\7 'world)) *standard-co* state nil)</span>.  Then in 
 this example: <span class="v">#\x</span> is 7; and <span class="v">vx</span> is the value of character <span class="v">#\7</span> 
 under the given alist, which is the symbol, <span class="v">WORLD</span>.  Thus, ACL2 will print 
 <span class="v">HELLO WORLD</span>.  When we say ``format <span class="v">str</span> under <span class="v">a+</span>'' we mean: 
 process the given string under an alist obtained by appending <span class="v">a</span> to the 
 current alist.  The following example illustrates how this works.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a> "~@0"
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\0 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> "~x0 ~@1" (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\0  'abc))))
                  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\1 "-- and now: ~x0 again~%"))
            *standard-co* state nil)

ABC -- and now: ABC again
&lt;state&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Note: <span class="v">~p</span>, <span class="v">~q</span>, <span class="v">~P</span>, and <span class="v">~Q</span> are also currently supported, 
 but are deprecated.  These are respectively the same as <span class="v">~x</span>, <span class="v">~y</span>, 
 <span class="v">~X</span>, and <span class="v">~Y</span>, except that their arguments are expected to be terms, 
 preferably untranslated (user-level) terms, that could be printed using infix 
 notation in certain environments.  Infix printing is not currently supported 
 but may be if there is sufficient need for it.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2's formatting functions print to the indicated channel, keeping track 
 of which column they are in.  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT1.html">Fmt1</a></span> can be used if the caller knows 
 which column the channel is in (i.e., how many <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> have been 
 printed since the last newline).  Otherwise, <span class="v">fmt</span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a></span> must be 
 used, both of which output a newline so as to establish the column position at 
 <span class="v">0</span>.  Unlike Common Lisp's <span class="v">format</span> routine, <span class="v">fmt</span> and its relatives 
 break the output into lines so that, by default, an attempt is made to avoid 
 printing past column <span class="v">77</span> (the value of constant 
 <span class="v">*fmt-hard-right-margin-default*</span>), except when using <span class="v">~S</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-FMT-HARD-RIGHT-MARGIN.html">set-fmt-hard-right-margin</a> for a discussion of how linebreaks are inserted and 
 how to change the relevant default settings.</p> 
 
 <p>The formatting functions scan the string from left to right, printing each 
 successive character unless it is a tilde <span class="v">(~)</span>.  Upon encountering tildes 
 the formatters take action determined by the character or <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> 
 immediately following the tilde.  The typical tilde-directive is a group of 
 three successive <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> from the string being printed.  For 
 example, <span class="v">~x0</span> is a 3 character <span class="v">tilde-directive</span>.  The first character 
 in a tilde-directive is always the tilde character itself.  The next character 
 is called the ``command'' character.  The character after that is usually 
 taken as the name of a ``format variable'' that is bound in the alist under 
 which the string is being printed.  Format variables are, by necessity, <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>.  The objects actually printed by a tilde-directive are the 
 objects obtained by looking up the command's format variables in the alist. 
 Typical format variable names are <span class="v">0</span>, <span class="v">1</span>, <span class="v">2</span>, ..., <span class="v">9</span>, <span class="v">a</span>, 
 <span class="v">b</span>, <span class="v">c</span>, etc., and if a tilde-directive uses the format variable 
 <span class="v">0</span>, as in <span class="v">~x0</span>, then the character <span class="v">#\0</span> must be bound in the 
 alist.  Some tilde commands take no arguments and others take more than one, 
 so some directives are of length two and others are longer.</p> 
 
 <p>It should be noted that this use of <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> in the string to 
 denote arguments is another break from Common Lisp's <span class="v">format</span> routine.  In 
 Common Lisp, the directives refer implicitly to the ``next item to be 
 printed.''  But in ACL2 the directives name each item explicitly with our 
 format variables.</p> 
 
 <p>The following text contains examples that can be evaluated.  To make this 
 process easier, we use a macro, <span class="v">fmx</span>.  It takes up to eleven arguments, 
 the first of which is a format string, <span class="v">str</span>, and the others of which are 
 taken as the values of format variables; for similar utilities that can be 
 called in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode functions, see <a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> and <a href="ACL2____FMX-CW.html">fmx-cw</a>. 
 The variables used are <span class="v">#\0</span> through <span class="v">#\9</span>.  The macro constructs an 
 appropriate alist, <span class="v">a</span>, and then evaluates <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a>` str a 0 *standard-co*
 state nil)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Thus,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "~%Here is v0, ~x0, and here is v1, ~x1."
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'value 0)
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'value 1))</pre> 
 
 <p>is just an abbreviation for</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FMT1.html">fmt1</a> "~%Here is v0, ~x0, and here is v1, ~x1."
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\0 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'value 0))
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 'value 1)))
      0
      *standard-co*
      state
      nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>which returns <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> 53 state)</span> after printing, on a separate line,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Here is v0, (<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">VALUE</a> . 0), and here is v1, (<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">VALUE</a> . 1).</pre> 
 
 <p>We now devote special attention to three of the tilde-directives whose use 
 is non-obvious.</p> 
 
 <p><i>The Case Statement</i></p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">~#x</span> is essentially a ``case statement'' in the language of <span class="v">fmt</span>. 
 The proper form of the statement is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">~#x~[case-0~/case-1~/ ... ~/case-k~],</pre> 
 
 <p>where each of the <span class="v">case-i</span> is a format string.  In the most common use, 
 the variable <span class="v">x</span> has an integer value, <span class="v">vx</span>, between <span class="v">0</span> and <span class="v">k</span>, 
 inclusive.  The effect of formatting the directive is to format 
 <span class="v">case-vx</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>For example</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "Go ~#0~[North~/East~/South~/West~].~%" 1)</pre> 
 
 <p>will print ``Go East.'' followed by a newline and will return</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> 0 state)</span>, while if you change the <span class="v">1</span> above to <span class="v">3</span> (the 
 maximum legal value), it will print ``Go West.''</p> 
 
 <p>In order to make it easier to print such phrases as ``there are seven 
 cases'' requiring agreement between subject and verb based on the number of 
 elements of a list, the case statement allows its variable to take a list as 
 its value and selects <span class="v">case-0</span> if the list has length <span class="v">1</span> and 
 <span class="v">case-1</span> otherwise.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((<a href="ACL2____CASES.html">cases</a> '(a b c)))
  (<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "There ~#0~[is ~n1 case~/are ~n1 cases~]."
       cases
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> cases)))</pre> 
 
 <p>will print ``There are three cases.'' but if you change the</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">'(a b c)</span> above simply to <span class="v">'(a)</span> it will print ``There is one 
 case.'' and if you change it to <span class="v">nil</span> it will print ``There are zero 
 cases.''</p> 
 
 <p><i>Indirection</i></p> 
 
 <p>Roughly speaking, <span class="v">~@</span> will act as though the value of its argument is a 
 format string and splice it into the current string at the current position. 
 It is often used when the phrase to be printed must be computed.  For 
 example,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((ev 'DEFUN))
 (<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "~x0 is an event~@1."
      'foo
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQ.html">member-eq</a> ev '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> defstub encapsulate))
          " that may introduce a function symbol"
          "")))</pre> 
 
 <p>will print ``<span class="v">foo</span> is an event that may introduce a function symbol,'' 
 but if the value of <span class="v">ev</span> is changed from <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> to 
 <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, it prints ``<span class="v">foo</span> is an event.''  The <span class="v">~@</span> 
 directive ``splices'' in the computed phrase (which might be empty).  Of 
 course, this particular example could be done with the case statement</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">~#1~[~/ that may introduce a function symbol~]</pre> 
 
 <p>where the value of <span class="v">#\1</span> is appropriately computed to be <span class="v">0</span> or 
 <span class="v">1</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If the argument to <span class="v">~@</span> is a pair, it is taken to be a format string 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span>ed onto an alist, i.e., <span class="v">("str" . a)</span>, and the alist, <span class="v">a</span>, 
 is used to extend the current one before <span class="v">"str"</span> is recursively 
 processed.  This feature of <span class="v">fmt</span> can be used to pass around ``phrases'' 
 that contain computed contextual information in <span class="v">a</span>.  The most typical use 
 is as ``error messages.''  For example, suppose you are writing a function 
 which does not have access to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> and so cannot print an error 
 message.  It may nevertheless be necessary for it to signal an error to its 
 caller, say by returning two results, the first of which is interpreted as an 
 error message if non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  Our convention is to use a <span class="v">~@</span> pair to 
 represent such messages.  For example, the error value might be produced by 
 the code:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a>
  "Error:  The instruction ~x0 is illegal when the stack is ~x1.~%"
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\0 (current-instruction st))
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\1 (i-stack st))))</pre> 
 
 <p>If the <span class="v">current-instruction</span> and <span class="v">i-stack</span> (whatever they are) are 
 <span class="v">'(popi 3)</span> and <span class="v">'(a b)</span> when the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span> above is evaluated, then 
 it produces</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">'("Error:  The instruction ~x0 is illegal when the stack is ~x1.~%"
  (#\0 POPI 3)
  (#\1 A B))</pre> 
 
 <p>and if this pair is made the value of the <span class="v">fmt</span> variable <span class="v">0</span>, then 
 <span class="v">~@0</span> will print</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Error:  The instruction (POPI 3) is illegal when the stack is (A B).</pre> 
 
 <p>For example, evaluate</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a>
 ((pair
  '("~%Error:  The instruction ~x0 is illegal when the stack is ~x1.~%"
    (#\0 POPI 3)
    (#\1 A B))))
 (<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "~@0" pair)).</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, even though the function that produced the ``error'' could not print 
 it, it could specify exactly what error message and data are to be 
 printed.</p> 
 
 <p>This example raises another issue.  Sometimes it is desirable to break 
 lines in your format strings so as to make your source code more attractive. 
 That is the purpose of the <span class="v">tilde-newline</span> directive.  The following code 
 produces exactly the same output as described above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((pair '("Error:  The instruction ~x0 ~
              is illegal when the stack is ~
              ~x1.~%"
              (#\0 POPI 3)
              (#\1 A B))))
 (<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "~%~@0" pair)).</pre> 
 
 <p>Finally, observe that when <span class="v">~@0</span> extends the current alist, <span class="v">alist</span>, 
 with the one, <span class="v">a</span>, in its argument, the bindings from <span class="v">a</span> are added to 
 the front of <span class="v">alist</span>, overriding the current values of any shared 
 variables.  This ensures that the variable values seen by the recursively 
 processed string, <span class="v">"str"</span>, are those from <span class="v">a</span>, but if <span class="v">"str"</span> 
 uses variables not bound in <span class="v">a</span>, their values are as specified in the 
 original alist.  Intuitively, variables bound in <span class="v">a</span> are local to the 
 processing of <span class="v">("str" . a)</span> but <span class="v">"str"</span> may use ``global 
 variables.''  The example above illustrates this because when the <span class="v">~@0</span> is 
 processed, <span class="v">#\0</span> is bound to the error message pair.  But when the 
 <span class="v">~x0</span> in the error string is processed, <span class="v">#\0</span> is bound to the illegal 
 instruction.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Iteration</i></p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">~*</span> directive is used to process each element of a list.  For 
 example,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((lst '(a b c d e f g h))) ; a true-list whose elements we exhibit
 (<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "~*0"
      `("Whoa!"          ; what to print if there's nothing to print
        "~x*!"           ; how to print the last element
        "~x* and "       ; how to print the 2nd to last element
        "~x*, "          ; how to print all other elements
        ,lst)))          ; the list of elements to print</pre> 
 
 <p>will print ``<span class="v">A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H!</span>''.  Try this example with 
 other true list values of <span class="v">lst</span>, such as <span class="v">'(a b)</span>, <span class="v">'(a)</span>, and 
 <span class="v">nil</span>.  The tilde-directives <span class="v">~&amp;0</span> and <span class="v">~v0</span>, which take a true list 
 argument and display its elements separated by commas and a final ``and'' or 
 ``or,'' are implemented in terms of the more general <span class="v">~*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">~*</span> directive allows the 5-tuple to specify in its final <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> an alist with which to extend the current one before processing the 
 individual elements.</p> 
 
 <p>We often use <span class="v">~*</span> to print a series of phrases, separated by suitable 
 punctuation, whitespace and noise words.  In such use, the <span class="v">~*</span> handles the 
 separation of the phrases and each phrase is generally printed by <span class="v">~@</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is a complex example.  In the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>, below, we bind phrases to 
 a list of <span class="v">~@</span> pairs and then we create a <span class="v">~*</span> 5-tuple to print out the 
 conjunction of the phrases with a parenthetical ``finally!'' if the series is 
 longer than 3.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((phrases
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> "simplifying with the replacement rules ~&amp;0"
                    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\0 '(rewrite-rule1
                                rewrite-rule2

 <p>You might wish to try evaluating the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span> after removing elements 
 of phrases.</p> 
 
 <p>Most of the output produced by ACL2 is produced via <span class="v">fmt</span> statements. 
 Thus, inspection of the source code will yield many examples.  A complicated 
 example is the code that explains the simplifier's work.  See <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a></span> 
 <span class="v">simplify-clause-msg1</span>.  An ad hoc example is provided by the function 
 <span class="v">fmt-doc-example</span>, which takes two arguments: an arbitrary true list and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.  To see how <span class="v">fmt-doc-example</span> works, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> 
 <span class="v">fmt-doc-example</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(fmt-doc-example '(a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p) state)</pre> 
 
 <p>will produce the output</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Here is a true list:  (A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P).  It has 16
elements, the third of which is C.

We could print each element in square brackets:
([A], [B], [C], [D], [E], [F], [G], [H], [I], [J], [K], [L], [M], [N],
[almost there: O], [the end: P]).  And if we wished to itemize them
into column 15 we could do it like this
0123456789012345
    0 (zeroth) A
    1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FIRST.html">first</a>)  B
    2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SECOND.html">second</a>) C
    3 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____THIRD.html">third</a>)  D
    4 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FOURTH.html">fourth</a>) E
    5 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FIFTH.html">fifth</a>)  F

               N
   14 (14th)   O
   15 (15th)   P
End of example.</pre> 
 
 <p>and return <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> 15 state)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we should remind the reader that <span class="v">fmt</span> and its subfunctions, 
 most importantly <span class="v">fmt0</span>, are written entirely in ACL2.  We make this 
 comment for two reasons.  First, it illustrates the fact that quite low level 
 code can be efficiently written in the language.  Second, it means that as a 
 last resort for documentation purposes you can read the source code without 
 changing languages.</p>
