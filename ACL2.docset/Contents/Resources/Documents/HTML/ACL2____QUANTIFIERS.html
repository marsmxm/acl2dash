<p>Issues about quantification in ACL2</p><p>ACL2 supports first-order quantifiers <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXISTS.html">exists</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a></span> by way of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> event.  However, proof support for 
 quantification is quite limited.  Therefore, you may prefer using recursion in 
 place of <span class="v">defun-sk</span> when possible (following common ACL2 practice).</p> 
 
 <p>For example, the notion ``every member of <span class="v">x</span> has property <span class="v">p</span>'' can 
 be defined either with recursion or explicit quantification, but proofs may be 
 simpler when recursion is used.  We illustrate this point with two proofs of 
 the same informal claim, one of which uses recursion which the other uses 
 explicit quantification.  Notice that with recursion, the proof goes through 
 fully automatically; but this is far from true with explicit quantification 
 (especially notable is the ugly hint).</p> 
 
 <p>The informal claim for our examples is: If every member <span class="v">a</span> of each of 
 two lists satisfies the predicate <span class="v">(p a)</span>, then this holds of their <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a></span>; and, conversely.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____QUANTIFIERS-USING-RECURSION.html">quantifiers-using-recursion</a> for a solution to this example using 
 recursion.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____QUANTIFIERS-USING-DEFUN-SK.html">quantifiers-using-defun-sk</a> for a solution to this example using 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span>.  Also See <a href="ACL2____QUANTIFIERS-USING-DEFUN-SK-EXTENDED.html">quantifiers-using-defun-sk-extended</a> for an 
 elaboration on that solution.</p> 
 
 <p>But perhaps first, see <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> for an ACL2 utility to introduce 
 first-order quantification in a direct way.  Examples of the use of 
 <span class="v">defun-sk</span> are also available: see <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">defun-sk-example</a> and see <a href="ACL2____TUTORIAL4-DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">Tutorial4-Defun-Sk-Example</a> for basic examples, and see <a href="ACL2____QUANTIFIER-TUTORIAL.html">quantifier-tutorial</a> for a more complete, careful beginner's introduction that 
 takes you through typical kinds of quantifier-based reasoning in ACL2.</p>
