<p>Standard libraries for ACL2.</p><p>The <b>std</b> library is meant to become <i>ACL2, Batteries 
Included</i>.  Its features a wide variety of books that work well together to 
provide a well-thought-out, documented, coherent reasoning strategy.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">Std</span> is currently under active development.  You are welcome to use it, 
but please be aware that things may change out from under you.</p> 
 
<p>So far, <span class="v">std</span> itself includes libraries about 
   <a href="ACL2____STD_F2BASIC.html">basic</a> concepts, 
   <a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS.html">lists</a>, 
   <a href="ACL2____STD_F2OSETS.html">sets</a>, 
   <a href="ACL2____STD_F2ALISTS.html">alists</a>, 
   <a href="ACL2____STD_F2TYPED-LISTS.html">typed-lists</a>, 
   <a href="ACL2____STD_F2STOBJS.html">stobjs</a>, 
   <a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">input/output</a>. 
Each of these libraries provides many lemmas for reasoning about built-in 
ACL2 functions, and also many additional functions.  There is also a very 
convenient <a href="ACL2____STD_F2UTIL.html">std/util</a> macro library, with macros that automate many 
otherwise-tedious tasks.  There is also a <a href="ACL2____STD_F2TESTING.html">std/testing</a> library with 
utilities to create tests.</p>
