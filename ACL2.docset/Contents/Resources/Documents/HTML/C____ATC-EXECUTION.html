<p>A model of C execution for ATC.</p><p>We distinguish between pure (i.e. side-effect-free) expressions 
     and expressions that may have side effects. 
     We allow the latter to appear only in certain parts of statements, 
     and we put restrictions to ensure a predictable order of evaluation. 
     Pure expressions may be evaluated in any order; 
     we evaluate them left to right.</p><p>We formalize a big-step operational interpretive semantics. 
     To ensure the termination of the ACL2 mutually recursive functions 
     that formalize the execution of statements, function calls, etc., 
     these ACL2 functions take a limit on the depth of the recursive calls, 
     which ends the recursion with an error when it reaches 0, 
     which is decremented at each recursive call, 
     and which is used as termination measure. 
     Thus, a proof of total correctness 
     (i.e. the code terminates and produces correct results) 
     involves showing the existence of sufficiently large limit values, 
     while a proof of partial correctness 
     (i.e. the code produces correct results if it terminates) 
     is relativized to the limit value not running out. 
     The limit is an artifact of the formalization; 
     it has no explicit counterpart in the execution state of the C code.</p>
