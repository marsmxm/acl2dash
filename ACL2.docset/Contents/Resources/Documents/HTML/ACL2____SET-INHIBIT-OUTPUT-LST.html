General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a> lst)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">lst</span> is a form (which may mention <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>) that evaluates 
 to a list of names, each of which is the name of one of the following 
 ``kinds'' of output produced by ACL2.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">error          error messages (but for hard errors, see below)
warning        warnings other than those related to soundness
warning!       warnings (of all degrees of importance)
observation    observations
prove          commentary produced by the theorem prover
proof-builder  commentary produced by the interactive proof-builder
event          non-proof commentary produced by events such as defun
               and encapsulate
history        output from history commands such as :ubt and :pbt
summary        the summary at the successful conclusion of an event
proof-tree     proof-tree output
comment        output from cw, cw!, and utilities like time$ that use them</pre> 
 
 <p>It is possible to inhibit each kind of output by putting the corresponding 
 name into <span class="v">lst</span>.  For example, if <span class="v">'warning</span> is included in (the value 
 of) <span class="v">lst</span>, then no warnings are printed except those related to soundness, 
 e.g., the inclusion of an uncertified book.  Note that <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> 
 output is affected by <span class="v">set-inhibit-output-lst</span>; see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that proof output can be controlled without inhibiting it using this 
 utility, and indeed is already quite limited by default.  See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> for a variant of this utility that can be used in 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a> for how to inhibit 
 individual warning types and see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBITED-SUMMARY-TYPES.html">set-inhibited-summary-types</a> for how to 
 inhibit individual parts of the <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Printing of events on behalf of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> is inhibited when both <span class="v">'event</span> and <span class="v">'prove</span> belong to 
 <span class="v">lst</span>.  Otherwise, printing of events is controlled by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> 
 special <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-PRE-EVAL-PRINT.html">ld-pre-eval-print</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Normally, hard error messages (see <a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a>) are not inhibited.  To 
 inhibit those as well when <span class="v">ERROR</span> output is inhibited: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a>
 inhibit-er-hard t)</span>.  To restore the original behavior: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a>
 inhibit-er-hard nil)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Note for advanced users.</i> By including <span class="v">warning!</span> in <span class="v">lst</span>, you 
 are automatically including <span class="v">warning</span> as well: all warnings will be 
 inhibited.  This is not the case if you modify value of state global variable 
 <span class="v">'inhibit-output-lst</span> directly (with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a></span> or <span class="v">f-put-global</span>); 
 then, if you include <span class="v">warning!</span> but not <span class="v">warning</span>, then warnings not 
 related to soundness will still be printed (which is probably not what was 
 intended).</p>
