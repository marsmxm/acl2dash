<p>A small library for working with dependency graphs.</p><p>This is just a small collection of basic graph algorithms for 
working with dependency graphs.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Graph Representation</h3> 
 
<p>We represent dependency graphs as simple <a href="ACL2____ALISTS.html">ACL2::alists</a> that bind nodes 
to the lists of nodes they (directly) depend on.  For instance, a graph 
like</p> 
 
<pre class="code">A -----&gt;  B ---&gt; C
          |      |
          |      |
          v      |
          D  &lt;---+</pre> 
 
<p>Could be represented as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">((A . (B))        ; A only depends on B
 (B . (C D))      ; B depends on C and D
 (C . (D))        ; C only depends on D
 (D . NIL))       ; D depends on nothing</pre> 
 
<p>Our algorithms treat <span class="v">graph</span> as an alist, i.e., any "shadowed" 
entries are ignored.</p> 
 
<p>There are no restrictions on the kinds of nodes that a graph can contain. 
However, our algorithms are generally based on <a href="ACL2____FAST-ALISTS.html">ACL2::fast-alists</a>, so for 
good performance:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>It is helpful for the nodes to be <a href="ACL2____NORMED.html">ACL2::normed</a> objects.  (This isn't 
strictly necessary; the nodes will be normed as needed.)</li> 
 
<li>It is helpful for <span class="v">graph</span> to be a fast alist.  (This isn't strictly 
necessary; the graph will be made fast if needed.)</li> 
 
</ul>
