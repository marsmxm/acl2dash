<p>Why we restrict <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>d recursive functions</p><p>Subtleties arise when one of the ``constrained'' functions, <span class="v">f</span>, 
 introduced in the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event, is 
 involved in the termination argument for a non-local recursively defined 
 function, <span class="v">g</span>, in that <span class="v">encapsulate</span>.  During the processing of the 
 encapsulated events, <span class="v">f</span> is locally defined to be some witness function, 
 <span class="v">f'</span>.  Properties of <span class="v">f'</span> are explicitly proved and exported from the 
 encapsulate as the constraints on the undefined function <span class="v">f</span>.  But if 
 <span class="v">f</span> is used in a recursive <span class="v">g</span> defined within the encapsulate, then the 
 termination proof for <span class="v">g</span> may use properties of <span class="v">f'</span>  the witness 
  that are not explicitly set forth in the constraints stated for 
 <span class="v">f</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Such recursive <span class="v">g</span> are said be ``subversive'' because if naively treated 
 they give rise to unsound induction schemes or (via functional instantiation) 
 recurrence equations that are impossible to satisfy.  We illustrate what could 
 go wrong below.</p> 
 
 <p>Subversive recursions are not banned outright.  Instead, they are treated 
 as part of the constraint.  That is, in the case above, the definitional 
 equation for <span class="v">g</span> becomes one of the constraints on <span class="v">f</span>.  This is 
 generally a severe restriction on future functional instantiations of <span class="v">f</span>. 
 In addition, ACL2 removes from its knowledge of <span class="v">g</span> any suggestions about 
 legal inductions to ``unwind'' its recursion.</p> 
 
 <p>What should you do?  Often, the simplest response is to move the offending 
 recursive definition, e.g., <span class="v">g</span>, out of the encapsulate.  That is, 
 introduce <span class="v">f</span> by constraint and then define <span class="v">g</span> as an ``independent'' 
 event.  You may need to constrain ``additional'' properties of <span class="v">f</span> in order 
 to admit <span class="v">g</span>, e.g., constrain it to reduce some ordinal measure.  However, 
 by separating the introduction of <span class="v">f</span> from the admission of <span class="v">g</span> you will 
 clearly identify the necessary constraints on <span class="v">f</span>, functional 
 instantiations of <span class="v">f</span> will be simpler, and <span class="v">g</span> will be a useful function 
 which suggests inductions to the theorem prover.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the functions introduced in the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> should not even 
 occur ancestrally in the termination proofs for non-local recursive functions 
 in the encapsulate.  That is, the constrained functions of an encapsulate 
 should not be reachable in the dependency graph of the functions used in the 
 termination arguments of recursive functions in encapsulate.  If they are 
 reachable, their definitions become part of the constraints.</p> 
 
 <p>The following event illustrates the problem posed by subversive 
 recursions.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
  (((f *) =&gt; *))
  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (x)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (f x))) t)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Suppose, contrary to how ACL2 works, that the encapsulate above were to 
 introduce no constraints on <span class="v">f</span> on the bogus grounds that the only use of 
 <span class="v">f</span> in the encapsulate is in an admissible function.  We discuss the 
 plausibility of this bogus argument in a moment.</p> 
 
 <p>Then it would be possible to prove the theorem:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> f-not-identity
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f '(a . b)) '(a . b)))
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints (("Goal" :use (:instance g (x '(a . b))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>simply by observing that if <span class="v">(f '(a . b))</span> were <span class="v">'(a . b)</span>, then 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> '(a . b))</span> would be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> '(a . b)))</span>, which is impossible.</p> 
 
 <p>But then we could functionally instantiate <span class="v">f-not-identity</span>, replacing 
 <span class="v">f</span> by the identity function, to prove <span class="v">nil</span>!  This is bad.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bad
  nil
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints
  (("Goal" :use (:functional-instance f-not-identity (f identity)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>This sequence of events was legal in versions of ACL2 prior to Version 1.5. 
 When we realized the problem we took steps to make it illegal.  However, our 
 steps were insufficient and it was possible to sneak in a subversive function 
 (via mutual recursion) as late as Version 2.3.</p> 
 
 <p>We now turn to the plausibility of the bogus argument above.  Why might one 
 even be tempted to think that the definition of <span class="v">g</span> above poses no 
 constraint on <span class="v">f</span>?  Here is a very similar encapsulate.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> (((f *) =&gt; *))
  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> map (x)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (f x) (map (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))
      nil)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Here <span class="v">map</span> plays the role of <span class="v">g</span> above.  Like <span class="v">g</span>, <span class="v">map</span> calls 
 the constrained function <span class="v">f</span>.  But <span class="v">map</span> truly does not constrain 
 <span class="v">f</span>.  In particular, the definition of <span class="v">map</span> could be moved ``out'' of 
 the encapsulate so that <span class="v">map</span> is introduced afterwards.  The difference 
 between <span class="v">map</span> and <span class="v">g</span> is that the constrained function plays no role in 
 the termination argument for the one but does for the other.</p> 
 
 <p>As a ``user-friendly'' gesture, ACL2 implicitly moves <span class="v">map</span>-like 
 functions out of encapsulations; logically speaking, they are introduced after 
 the encapsulation.  This simplifies the constraint.  When the constraint 
 cannot be thus simplified the user is advised, via the ``infected'' warning, 
 to phrase the encapsulation in the simplest way possible.  See <a href="ACL2____INFECTED-CONSTRAINTS.html">infected-constraints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The lingering bug between Versions 1.5 and 2.3 mentioned above was due to 
 our failure to detect the <span class="v">g</span>-like nature of some functions when they were 
 defined in mutually recursively cliques with other functions.  The singly 
 recursive case was recognized.  The bug arose because our detection 
 ``algorithm'' was based on the ``suggested inductions'' left behind by 
 successful definitions.  We failed to recall that mutually-recursive 
 definitions do not, as of this writing, make any suggestions about inductions 
 and so did not leave any traces of their subversive natures.</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude by elaborating on the criterion ``involved in the termination 
 argument'' mentioned at the outset.  Suppose that function <span class="v">f</span> is 
 recursively defined in an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, where the body of <span class="v">f</span> has no 
 ``ancestor'' among the functions introduced in the signature of that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, i.e.: the body contains no call of a signature function, no call 
 of a function whose body calls a signature function, and so on.  Then ACL2 
 treats <span class="v">f</span> as though it is defined in front of that <span class="v">encapsulate</span> form; 
 so <span class="v">f</span> is not <span class="v">constrained</span> by the encapsulate, and its definition is 
 hence certainly not subversive in the sense discussed above.  But suppose to 
 the contrary that some function introduced in the signature is an ancestor of 
 the body of <span class="v">f</span>.  Then the definition of <span class="v">f</span> is subversive if moreover, 
 its termination proof obligation has an ancestor among the signature 
 functions.  Now, that proof obligation involves terms from the first argument 
 of selected calls of <span class="v">IF</span>, as well as recursive calls; for a detailed 
 discussion, see <a href="ACL2____RULERS.html">rulers</a>.  The important point here is that for the 
 recursive calls, only the arguments in ``measured'' positions are relevant to 
 the termination proof obligation.  Consider the following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 (((h *) =&gt; *))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> h (n) n))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (i n)
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> i)
       n
     (f (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> i) (h n)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 heuristically picks the measure <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> i)</span> for the definition 
 of <span class="v">f</span>; thus, <span class="v">i</span> is the only ``measured formal'' of <span class="v">f</span>.  Since 
 <span class="v">i</span> is the first formal of <span class="v">f</span>, then for the recursive call of <span class="v">f</span>, 
 only the first argument contributes to the termination proof obligation: in 
 this case, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> i)</span> but not <span class="v">(h n)</span>.  Thus, even though <span class="v">h</span> is a 
 signature function, the definition of <span class="v">f</span> is not considered to be 
 subversive; an induction scheme is thus stored for <span class="v">f</span>.  (This restriction 
 to measured formal positions of recursive calls, for determining subversive 
 definitions, is new in Version_3.5 of ACL2.)</p>
