<p>Syntax for inputs/outputs/overrides/internals entries of <a href="ACL2____DEFSVTV.html">defsvtv</a> forms</p> 
 
<p>An SVTV is a timing diagram-like format similar to <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> <a href="ACL2____SYMBOLIC-TEST-VECTORS.html">ACL2::symbolic-test-vectors</a>.  Each of the fields <span class="v">:inputs</span>, <span class="v">:outputs</span>, 
<span class="v">:overrides</span>, and <span class="v">:internals</span> may have a table (list of lists) where the 
rows each pertain to a particular (vector) signal and the columns each pertain 
to a particular time step.  The <span class="v">:inputs</span> and <span class="v">:overrides</span> entries 
provide inputs to the simulation and the <span class="v">:outputs</span> and <span class="v">:internals</span> 
entries extract outputs.</p> 
 
<h4>Example</h4> 
 
<p>Here is an example input/override table:</p> 
<pre class="code">'(("clk"        1   ~)         ;; toggles until the end
  ("enable"     _  en)         ;; keeps assigned value until the end
  ("dataport"   _ #x20  _)
  ("data_busa"  _   _   _   a   _)
  ("data_busb"  _   _   _   b   _)
  ("opcode"     _  op   _   _   _)
  ("clkgates"   _  -1   _  -1   _))</pre> 
<p>And an example output/internal table:</p> 
<pre class="code">'(("output_signal1"   _   _   _  out1 _   _   _)
  ("output_signal2"   _   _   _   _   _ out2  _))</pre> 
 
<p>In both cases, each table is a list of lists.  Each interior list 
contains a signal name followed by a list of entries, each of which corresponds 
to a phase of simulation.  The number of simulation phases of an SVTV is the 
maximum length of any such entry list among the <span class="v">:inputs</span>, <span class="v">:outputs</span>, 
<span class="v">:overrides</span>, and <span class="v">:internals</span>.  Input/override entries that are shorter 
than the simulation are extended to the simulation length by repeating their 
last entry, whereas output/internal entries that are shorter than the 
simulation are extended with <span class="v">_</span> entries.</p> 
 
<h4>Output Specifications</h4> 
 
<p>There are only two kinds of valid entry for <span class="v">:outputs</span>/<span class="v">:internals</span> 
tables:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">_</span> or <span class="v">-</span>, meaning the signal is ignored at the phase</li> 
 
<li>A variable name, meaning that the signal's value at that phase is assigned 
to that output variable.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>So in the above example, at simulation time frame 4, the value of 
<span class="v">"output_signal1"</span> will be extracted and at time frame 6, the value of 
<span class="v">"output_signal2"</span> will be extracted; and these values will be assigned, 
respectively, to output variables <span class="v">out1</span> and <span class="v">out2</span>.</p> 
 
<h4>Input Specifications</h4> 
 
<p>There are several types of valid entries for <span class="v">:inputs</span>/<span class="v">:overrides</span> 
tables:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">_</span> or <span class="v">-</span> (actually, any symbol whose name is "_" or "-") makes 
the signal undriven at that phase.  Actually, this means slightly different 
things for inputs versus overrides: for an input, the wire simply doesn't get 
assigned a value, whereas for an override, it isn't overridden at that 
phase.</li> 
 
<li>An integer or <a href="SV____4VEC.html">4vec</a>: the signal is assigned that value at that 
time.  (An integer <i>is</i> a 4vec, just to be clear.)</li> 
 
<li>(Deprecated): the symbol <span class="v">acl2::x</span> means the same thing as the constant 
value <span class="v">(<a href="SV____4VEC-X.html">4vec-x</a>)</span> or <span class="v">(-1 . 0)</span>, namely, assign all bits of the signal the 
value X at the given phase.</li> 
 
<li>(Deprecated): the symbol <span class="v">:ones</span> means the same thing as -1, namely, 
assign all bits of the signal the value 1 at the given phase.</li> 
 
<li>The symbol <span class="v">~</span> (actually, any symbol whose name is "~"), which must be 
preceded by a constant (4vec) or another <span class="v">~</span>, means the signal is assigned 
the bitwise negation of its value from the previous phase.  Thus the "clk" 
signal in the above example is assigned 1, then 0, then 1, etc., because the 
final <span class="v">~</span> is replicated out to the end of the simulation.</li> 
 
<li>Any other symbol becomes an input variable assigned to that signal at that 
phase.</li> 
 
</ul>
