<p>Ways of extending <a href="VL2014____VL-SIMPLIFY.html">vl-simplify</a> with custom transformations.</p><p>These are hooks for additional transforms that we use at Centaur, 
but which have not yet been released for whatever reason.  When it comes time 
for us to run our transforms, we just defattach our implementations to these 
hooks.  For non-Centaur users, these steps are just no-ops.</p> 
 
<p>Some of these transforms will never be released because they're gross hacks 
that are intended to address Centaur-specific things, and they wouldn't be of 
any interest outside of Centaur.  We may release the others eventually, but 
they may be in beta or tied into other libraries in a deep way that makes it 
hard to make them available at this time.</p>
