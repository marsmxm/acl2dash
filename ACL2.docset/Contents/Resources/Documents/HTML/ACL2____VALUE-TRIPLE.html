 <h3>Description</h3> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Value-triple</span> provides a convenient way to evaluate a form in a context 
 where an <a href="ACL2____EVENT.html">event</a> is expected; thus, a call of <span class="v">value-triple</span> may occur 
 in <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> forms and in <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  By 
 default, the form should evaluate to a single, non-<a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> value (but see 
 the discussion below about the <span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT</span> keyword argument).  Calls of 
 <span class="v">value-triple</span> are skipped by default when proofs are being skipped (but 
 see the discussion below about the <span class="v">:ON-SKIP-PROOFS</span> keyword argument).  By 
 default, a <span class="v">value-triple</span> call has no effect other than to evaluate its 
 form, but see the discussion of the <span class="v">:CHECK</span> keyword below for how to check 
 the result.</p> 
 
 <p>A call of <span class="v">value-triple</span> returns an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val
 state)</span>.  By default or when <span class="v">:CHECK nil</span> is supplied: <span class="v">erp</span> is 
 <span class="v">nil</span> when evaluation completes without error and <span class="v">val</span> is the value 
 returned by evaluating the given form.  However, when the keyword argument 
 <span class="v">:CHECK</span> has a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value, there is a check that <span class="v">val</span> is 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  Note that the value of keyword argument <span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT</span> can 
 affect this notion of ``the value returned'' (by evaluation), as discussed 
 below.</p> 
 
 <h3>Keyword Arguments</h3> 
 
 <p>Here is documentation for the keyword arguments, arranged alphabetically 
 and followed by relevant remarks.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:CHECK chk</span> (default: <span class="v">nil</span>)</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">chk</span> is supplied and non-<span class="v">nil</span>, the value returned by 
 evaluating the given form must be non-<span class="v">nil</span>, or else an error occurs: The 
 error message is generic if <span class="v">chk</span> is <span class="v">t</span>.  (By default a single value is 
 returned, so the notion of ``the value returned'' is clear; but see the 
 discussion of <span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT</span> below for the notion of ``the value returned'' 
 in the general case.)  If <span class="v">chk</span> is supplied and is neither <span class="v">t</span> nor 
 <span class="v">nil</span>, then it should be a ``message'' (see <a href="ACL2____MSG.html">msg</a>) that is used when 
 printing the error message.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:CTX ctx</span> (default: <span class="v">'value-triple</span>)</p> 
 
 <p>Error messages from <span class="v">value-triple</span> start, by default, with ``ACL2 Error 
 in VALUE-TRIPLE''.  To replace <span class="v">VALUE-TRIPLE</span> with a different context (see 
 <a href="ACL2____CTX.html">ctx</a>), <span class="v">ctx</span>, supply keyword argument <span class="v">:CTX ctx</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:ON-SKIP-PROOFS sp</span> (default: <span class="v">nil</span>)</p> 
 
 <p>By default or when <span class="v">:ON-SKIP-PROOFS</span> has value <span class="v">nil</span>, the form is not 
 evaluated when proofs are being skipped.  The form is, however, evaluated when 
 <span class="v">:ON-SKIP-PROOFS t</span> is supplied.  The other legal value for 
 <span class="v">:ON-SKIP-PROOFS</span> is <span class="v">:interactive</span>, which is more restrictive than 
 <span class="v">t</span>.  <span class="v">:Interactive</span> directs the <span class="v">value-triple</span> call to be skipped 
 when executing an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> or making a second pass through an 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, but not merely because <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">set-ld-skip-proofsp</a> t state)</span> 
 has been executed.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:SAFE-MODE safe-mode</span> (default: <span class="v">:same</span>)</p> 
 
 <p>It is usually safe to ignore this option, which is available for backward 
 compatibility: <span class="v">:SAFE-MODE t</span> gives the behavior of <span class="v">assert-event</span> from 
 before April, 2021.  Normally ACL2 operates without so-called ``safe-mode''; 
 see <a href="ACL2____SAFE-MODE.html">safe-mode</a>.  The value <span class="v">:same</span> prevents any change in whether 
 safe-mode is on or off; otherwise the value is <span class="v">t</span> to evaluate the form 
 with safe-mode on and <span class="v">nil</span> for safe-mode off.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT stobjs-out</span> (default: <span class="v">nil</span>)</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">stobjs-out</span> has its default value of <span class="v">nil</span>, which abbreviates 
 the value <span class="v">(nil)</span>, the form supplied to <span class="v">value-triple</span> is expected to 
 evaluate to a single, non-<a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> value.  However, multiple-value 
 return (see <a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a>) is also allowed, including stobjs (user-defined 
 stobjs as well as <span class="v">state</span>).  The return shape is specified by supplying 
 <span class="v">stobjs-out</span> as a true list corresponding to the values returned, with 
 stobj names in stobj positions and <span class="v">nil</span> elsewhere.  (The list has length 
 one if a single value is returned.)  For example, if <span class="v">stobjs-out</span> is 
 <span class="v">(nil st1 nil st2)</span> then the form should evaluate to a multiple-value 
 return, with ordinary values in (zero-based) positions 0 and 2, stobj <span class="v">st1</span> 
 in position 1, and stobj <span class="v">st2</span> in position 3.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Stobjs-out</span> may also be <span class="v">:auto</span>, which allows arbitrary returns.</p> 
 
 <p>We speak of ``the value returned''.  When the evaluation results in a 
 single value, that is of course the value returned.  When multiple values are 
 returned, the first of those values is normally what we mean by ``the value 
 returned'', with the following exception.  When an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a> is 
 returned, say <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val state)</span> where <span class="v">erp</span> and <span class="v">val</span> are 
 non-stobj values and <span class="v">state</span> is the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, then <span class="v">val</span> is 
 considered to be the value returned if <span class="v">erp</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>; but if <span class="v">erp</span> 
 is not <span class="v">nil</span>, then there is no value returned, and <span class="v">value-triple</span> 
 results in an error.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">:CHECK</span> has a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value then the value returned must not be 
 a stobj.  Otherwise, when the value returned is a stobj it is replaced by the 
 stobj's name, as discussed below.</p> 
 
 <h3>Remarks</h3> 
 
 <p>We conclude by remarking on some details.  These remarks also apply to 
 <a href="ACL2____ASSERT-EVENT.html">assert-event</a>, since it expands to make corresponding calls of 
 <span class="v">value-triple</span>.</p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li>Since <span class="v">value-triple</span> is an <a href="ACL2____EVENT.html">event</a> macro, it returns an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>, that is, the multiple values <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val state)</span>, where 
 <span class="v">erp</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> exactly when the event completes without error.  If the 
 value of keyword argument <span class="v">:CHECK</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">erp</span> is 
 <span class="v">nil</span>, then <span class="v">val</span> is <span class="v">:passed</span>.  Otherwise <span class="v">val</span> is the value 
 returned as discussed above.  To be precise: <span class="v">val</span> is the result of 
 evaluating the given form in the default case, when <span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT</span> is not 
 provided (or is <span class="v">nil</span> or <span class="v">(nil)</span>), but in general there several cases 
 possible, as follows.</li> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>If the evaluation of the given form results in a single non-stobj value, 
 then <span class="v">val</span> is that value.</li> 
 
 <li>If the evaluation of the given form results in a single stobj value, then 
 <span class="v">val</span> is that stobj's name (a symbol).  In particular, if the value is 
 state, then <span class="v">val</span> is the symbol <span class="v">STATE</span> (in the <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> 
 package).</li> 
 
 <li>If the evaluation of the given form results in multiple values <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> x1
 ...)</span>, then <span class="v">val</span> is <span class="v">x1</span> if <span class="v">x1</span> is not a stobj, else <span class="v">val</span> is 
 the name of that stobj.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <li>When <span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT</span> is <span class="v">:auto</span> and at least one user-defined <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> is returned, you will see a <span class="v">"User-stobjs-modified"</span> warning 
 unless warnings have been suppressed.  Although warnings are typically 
 suppressed by general utilities such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a></span>, a more direct way to avoid 
 this warning is to specify <span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT</span> as a list (as discussed 
 above).</li> 
 
 <li>As noted above, the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> may change when keyword option 
 <span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT</span> has a value other than <span class="v">nil</span> or <span class="v">(nil)</span>.  Nevertheless, 
 ACL2 ensures that certain parts of the state, including the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, are the same after the <span class="v">value-triple</span> call completes as they were 
 before (as with <span class="v">make-event</span> expansion; see <a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>).  Also, 
 trust tags (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>) must not be introduced during such 
 evaluation.</li> 
 
 <li>(Ignore this remark unless you make many, many calls of 
 <span class="v">value-triple</span>.)  Evaluation may be much faster when <span class="v">:STOBJS-OUT</span> is 
 omitted or is specified as <span class="v">nil</span> (the default) or <span class="v">(nil)</span>.  That is 
 because otherwise, since the return shape is checked only after evaluation 
 completes, therefore a somewhat complex environment set-up is performed prior 
 to evaluation, in which certain parts of the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> are protected 
 as for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> (using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REVERT-WORLD.html">revert-world</a></span>, and also as discussed 
 in the documentation for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> about 
 <span class="v">*protected-system-state-globals*</span>).  Moreover, evaluation is faster still 
 if in addition, the given form is <span class="v">t</span>, <span class="v">nil</span>, a <a href="COMMON-LISP____KEYWORD.html">keyword</a>, or of 
 the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">QUOTE</a> x)</span>.</li>
