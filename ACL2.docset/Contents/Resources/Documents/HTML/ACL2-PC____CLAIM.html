<p>(atomic macro) 
add a new hypothesis</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(claim (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y))   -- attempt to prove (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y) from the current
                     top-level hypotheses and if successful, then
                     add (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y) as a new top-level hypothesis in
                     the current goal
(claim (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y)
       :otf-flg t
       :hints (("Goal" :induct t)))
                  -- as above, but call the prover using the
                     indicated values for the otf-flg and hints
(claim (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y) 0) -- as above, except instead of attempting to
                     prove (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y), create a new subgoal with the
                     same top-level hypotheses as the current goal
                     that has (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y) as its conclusion
(claim (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y) :hints :none)
                  -- same as immediately above

General Form:
(claim expr &amp;rest rest-args)</pre> 
 
 <p>This command creates a new subgoal with the same top-level hypotheses as 
 the current goal but with a conclusion of <span class="v">expr</span>.  If <span class="v">rest-args</span> is a 
 non-empty list headed by a non-keyword, then there will be no proof attempted 
 for the new subgoal.  With that possible exception, <span class="v">rest-args</span> should 
 consist of keyword arguments.  The keyword argument <span class="v">:do-not-flatten</span> 
 controls the ``flattening'' of new hypotheses, just as with the <span class="v">casesplit</span> 
 command (see <a href="ACL2-PC____CASESPLIT.html">ACL2-pc::casesplit</a>).  The remaining <span class="v">rest-args</span> are 
 used with a call the <span class="v">prove</span> command on the new subgoal, except that if 
 <span class="v">:hints</span> is a non-<span class="v">nil</span> atom, then the prover is not called â€” 
 rather, this is the same as the situation described above, where 
 <span class="v">rest-args</span> is a non-empty list headed by a non-keyword.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remarks:</b> (1) Unlike the <span class="v">casesplit</span> command, the <span class="v">claim</span> 
 command is completely insensitive to governors. (2) It is allowed to use 
 abbreviations in the hints.  (3) The keyword <span class="v">:</span><span class="v">none</span> has the special 
 role as a value of <span class="v">:</span><span class="v">hints</span> that is shown clearly in an example 
 above.</p>
