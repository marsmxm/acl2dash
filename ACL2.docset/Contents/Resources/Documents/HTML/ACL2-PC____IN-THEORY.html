(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a>
   (<a href="ACL2____UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a> (<a href="ACL2____THEORY.html">theory</a> 'minimal-theory) '(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> binary-append)))

General Form:

 <p>If the argument is not supplied, then this command sets the current 
 interactive proof-builder theory (see below for explanation) to agree with the 
 current ACL2 theory.  Otherwise, the argument should be a theory expression, 
 and in that case the proof-builder theory is set to the value of that theory 
 expression.</p> 
 
 <p>The current interactive proof-builder theory is used in all calls to the 
 ACL2 theorem prover and rewriter from inside the proof-builder.  Thus, the 
 most recent <span class="v">in-theory</span> instruction in the current <span class="v">state-stack</span> has an 
 effect in the proof-builder totally analogous to the effect caused by an 
 <span class="v">in-theory</span> hint or event in ACL2.  All <span class="v">in-theory</span> instructions before 
 the last are ignored, because they refer to the current theory in the ACL2 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>, not to the existing proof-builder theory.  For example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:trans1 (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> bar)
 (<a href="ACL2____UNION-THEORIES.html">UNION-THEORIES</a> (<a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">CURRENT-THEORY</a> :HERE)
                 '(BAR))
ACL2 !&gt;:trans1 (<a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">CURRENT-THEORY</a> :HERE)
 (CURRENT-THEORY-FN :HERE WORLD)
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> bar))</span> modifies the current theory of the 
 current ACL2 world.  So for example, suppose that <span class="v">foo</span> is disabled outside 
 the proof-builder and you execute the following instructions, in this 
 order.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> foo))
(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> bar))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then after the second of these, <span class="v">bar</span> will be enabled in the 
 proof-builder, but <span class="v">foo</span> will be disabled.  The reason is that 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> bar))</span> instructs the proof-builder to modify the 
 current theory (from outside the proof-builder, not from inside the 
 proof-builder) by enabling <span class="v">bar</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">in-theory</span> instructions in the proof-builder have no effect 
 outside the proof-builder's interactive loop.</p> 
 
 <p>If the most recent <span class="v">in-theory</span> instruction in the current state of the 
 proof-builder has no arguments, or if there is no <span class="v">in-theory</span> instruction 
 in the current state of the proof-builder, then the proof-builder will use the 
 current ACL2 theory.  This is true even if the user has interrupted the 
 interactive loop by exiting and changing the global ACL2 theory.  However, if 
 the most recent <span class="v">in-theory</span> instruction in the current state of the 
 proof-builder had an argument, then global changes to the current theory will 
 have no effect on the proof-builder state.</p>
