<p>Fixtype of ATJ function types.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p>

</dl><p>An ATJ function type consists of 
     (zero or more) types for the arguments (i.e. inputs) 
     and (one or more) types for the results (i.e. outputs). 
     This is like an arrow type in higher-order languages.</p><p>We also augment the output types with array names. 
     These are represented via a list of symbols, 
     whose length must match the length of the output type list 
     (this length constraint is not explicitly captured in this fixtype, 
     but it is an expected invariant). 
     The <span class="v">nil</span> symbol may be used in any position of the list, 
     meaning that there is no array name for the corresponding output type. 
     A non-<span class="v">nil</span> symbol may be used only in a position 
     whose corresponding output type is a <span class="v">:jprimarr</span> type. 
     In this case the symbol must match a formal parameter of the function 
     that has the same array type as input type. 
     The non-<span class="v">nil</span> symbols must be all distinct.</p><p>The purpose of these array names is to support 
     the analysis of single-threaded use of Java primitive arrays 
     described at <a href="JAVA____ATJ-PRE-TRANSLATION-ARRAY-ANALYSIS.html">atj-pre-translation-array-analysis</a>. 
     The idea is that if a function takes an array as input 
     (i.e. that input type is a <span class="v">:jprimarr</span> type) 
     and if the function may modify that array (directly or indirectly), 
     then the possibly modified array must be returned as a result: 
     an explicit non-<span class="v">nil</span> array name assigned to a result 
     specifies which result that is, and simplifies the analysis. 
     If instead a function does not modify an input array, 
     no result with the same name as the input needs to exist. 
     Results of non-array types use <span class="v">nil</span> as array (non-)name. 
     If a function creates an array (directly or indirectly) and returns it, 
     then <span class="v">nil</span> is used for that result, 
     i.e. the array has no name because it does not modify any input array 
     (and thus there is no input name to match); 
     it represents a newly created array.</p>
