<p>Characters in ACL2 and operations on them</p><p>ACL2 accepts 256 distinct characters, which are the characters 
 obtained by applying the function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a></span> to each integer from 
 <span class="v">0</span> to <span class="v">255</span>.  Among these, Common Lisp designates certain ones as 
 <i>standard characters</i>, namely those of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a> n)</span> where 
 <span class="v">n</span> is from <span class="v">33</span> to <span class="v">126</span>, together with <span class="v">#\Newline</span> and 
 <span class="v">#\Space</span>.  The actual standard characters may be viewed by evaluating the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span> <span class="v">*standard-chars*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>To be more precise, Common Lisp does not specify the precise relationship 
 between <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a></span> and the standard characters.  However, we check that 
 the underlying Common Lisp implementation uses a particular relationship that 
 extends the usual ASCII coding of characters.  We also check that Space, Tab, 
 Newline, Page, Rubout, and Return correspond to characters with respective 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-CODE.html">char-code</a></span>s <span class="v">32</span>, <span class="v">9</span>, <span class="v">10</span>, <span class="v">12</span>, <span class="v">127</span>, and 
 <span class="v">13</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">Code-char</a></span> has an inverse, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-CODE.html">char-code</a></span>.  Thus, when <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-CODE.html">char-code</a></span> is applied to an ACL2 character, <span class="v">c</span>, it returns a number <span class="v">n</span> 
 between <span class="v">0</span> and <span class="v">255</span> inclusive such that <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a> n)</span> = 
 <span class="v">c</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The preceding paragraph implies that there is only one ACL2 character with 
 a given character code.  CLTL allows for ``attributes'' for characters, which 
 could allow distinct characters with the same code, but ACL2 does not allow 
 this.</p> 
 
 <p><i>The Character Reader</i></p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 supports the `<span class="v">#\</span>' notation for characters provided by Common 
 Lisp, with some restrictions.  First of all, for every character <span class="v">c</span>, the 
 notation</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">#\c</pre> 
 
 <p>may be used to denote the character object <span class="v">c</span>.  That is, the user may 
 type in this notation and ACL2 will read it as denoting the character object 
 <span class="v">c</span>.  In this case, the character immediately following <span class="v">c</span> must be one 
 of the following ``terminating characters'': a Tab, a Newline, a Page 
 character, a space, or one of the characters:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">"  '  (  )  ;  `  ,</pre> 
 
 <p>Other than the notation above, ACL2 accepts alternate notation for five 
 characters.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">#\Space
#\Tab
#\Newline
#\Page
#\Rubout
#\Return</pre> 
 
 <p>Again, in each of these cases the next character must be from among the set 
 of ``terminating characters'' described in the single-character case.  Our 
 implementation is consistent with ISO-8859-1, even though we don't provide 
 <span class="v">#\</span> syntax for entering characters other than that described above.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we note that it is our intention that any object printed by ACL2's 
 top-level-loop may be read back into ACL2.  Please notify the implementors if 
 you find a counterexample to this claim.</p>
