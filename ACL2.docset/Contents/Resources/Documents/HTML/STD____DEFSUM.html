<p>(Beta) Introduce a tagged union data type, also commonly called a 
variant or sum type.</p><div class="box"><p>Note: Defsum is currently under development.  You are welcome

<h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p><b>Defsum</b> is a macro that automates introducing a recognizer, 
pattern-binding macro, and certain supporting theorems for new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union" target="_blank"><nobr>tagged union<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_union"></nobr></a> data 
types.</p> 
 
<p>Defsum is currently restricted to unions of tagged aggregates, which must be 
introduced ahead of time using <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">defaggregate</a>, and does not currently 
support mutual recursive data types.  (In the future we may work to lift these 
restrictions).</p>
