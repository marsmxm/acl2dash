<p>Introduction to filename conventions in ACL2</p><p>The notion of pathname objects from Common Lisp is not supported in 
 ACL2, nor is the function <span class="v">pathname</span>.  However, ACL2 supports file 
 operations, using conventions for naming files based on those of the 
 Unix (trademark of AT&amp;T) operating system, so that the character <span class="v">/</span> is 
 used to terminate directory names.  Some file names are ``absolute'' 
 (complete) descriptions of a file or directory; others are ``relative'' to the 
 current working directory or to the connected book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>). 
 We emphasize that even for users of Windows-based systems or Macintosh 
 computers, ACL2 file names are in the Unix style.  We will call these <i>ACL2 
 pathnames</i>, often omitting the ``ACL2.''</p> 
 
 <p>Pathnames starting with the directory separator (<span class="v">/</span>) or the tilde 
 character (<span class="v">~</span>) are absolute pathnames.  All other pathnames are relative 
 pathnames.  An exception is in the Microsoft Windows operating system, where 
 it is illegal for the pathname to start with a tilde character but the drive 
 may be included, e.g., <span class="v">"c:/home/smith/acl2/book-1.lisp"</span>.  In fact, the 
 drive <i>must</i> be included in the portcullis of a book; see <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>.  Note also that some host Common Lisps will not support pathnames 
 starting with <span class="v">"~"</span>, for example <span class="v">~smith</span>, though ACL2 will generally 
 support those starting with <span class="v">"~/"</span> regardless of the host Common 
 Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider the following examples.  The filename string</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">"/home/smith/acl2/book-1.lisp"</pre> 
 
 <p>is an absolute pathname, with top-level directory <span class="v">"home"</span>, under that 
 the directory <span class="v">"smith"</span> and then the directory <span class="v">"acl2"</span>, and 
 finally, within that directory the file <span class="v">"book-1.lisp"</span>.  If the 
 connected book directory is <span class="v">"/home/smith/"</span> (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>), then the 
 filename string above also corresponds to the relative filename string 
 "acl2/book1.lisp".</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we note that (on non-Windows systems) the pathname <span class="v">"~"</span> and 
 pathnames starting with <span class="v">"~/"</span> are illegal in books being certified. 
 Otherwise, a subsidiary <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form would have a different 
 meaning at certification time than at a later time when the certified book is 
 included by a different user.</p>
