<p>Sanity check to prevent tricky kinds of global name shadowing.</p><p>In some Verilog tools, top-level and imported declarations can 
sometimes be shadowed by local declarations for only part of a module.  For 
instance,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">parameter foo = 1;

module m ();
  logic [3:0] a = foo;     // references the global foo
  parameter foo = 2;
  logic [3:0] b = foo;     // references the local foo
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Throughout VL we generally abstract away from the parse order and expect to 
be able to traverse scopes in a simple set-like way.  This approach makes 
supporting this kind of lexical shadowing a challenge.  To avoid any problems 
due to this kind of shadowing, we implement a special check to prohibit globals 
from being used before they are locally declared.</p> 
 
<p>This checking depends on the parse order.  It occurs as part of the <a href="VL2014____MAKE-IMPLICIT-WIRES.html">make-implicit-wires</a> transform.  Note that we do this checking after we have 
already introduced implicit wires, so we can assume that implicit wires have 
explicit declarations.</p>
