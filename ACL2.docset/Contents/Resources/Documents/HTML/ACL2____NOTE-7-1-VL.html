<p>Notes about changes to <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> and <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> in ACL2 Version 
7.1.</p><h3>VL Fork</h3> 
 
 <p>There have been many changes to <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> and <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>.  Most notably, 
 VL has been forked into two versions.</p> 
 
 <dl> 
 <dt>
<a href="ACL2____VL2014.html">vl2014</a> is a ``stable'' fork of VL.</dt> 
 <dd>It lives in a new directory: <span class="v">books/centaur/vl2014</span>
</dd> 
 <dd>It uses the <span class="v">VL2014</span> package.</dd> 
 <dd>It continues to work with <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> and other, older tools.</dd> 
 <dd>It is no longer under active development by Centaur.</dd> 
 
 <dt>
<a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> continues as the ``development'' version of VL.</dt> 
 <dd>It continues to live in: <span class="v">books/centaur/vl</span>.</dd> 
 <dd>It continues to use the <span class="v">VL</span> package.</dd> 
 <dd>It <b>no longer supports <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a></b>.</dd> 
 <dd>It remains under active development.</dd> 
 <dd>It targets a new backend (instead of esim) which is still under development.</dd> 
 <dd>It may be rather unstable and not yet particularly usable.</dd> 
 </dl> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">vl</span> code base is in many cases significantly different than 
 <a href="ACL2____VL2014.html">vl2014</a>.  It features a new, more strongly typed expression 
 representation, generally better abstractions for working with 
 scopes/hierarchy and types, and new approaches to elaboration and sizing that 
 can handle much more of SystemVerilog.  More information on the motives and 
 consequences of this split can be found in the documentation for <a href="ACL2____VL2014.html">vl2014</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Largely in support of this fork, many books have been reorganized.  Many 
 books that are specific to the VL/ESIM flow have been moved into the ESIM 
 directory:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">centaur/vl/top.lisp --&gt; centaur/vl/defmodules.lisp (with a stub)
centaur/vl/defmodules.lisp --&gt; centaur/esim/defmodules.lisp
centaur/vl/translation.lisp --&gt; centaur/esim/translation.lisp
centaur/vl/toe --&gt; centaur/esim/vltoe (filenames have been unsmurfed)
centaur/vl/util/esim-lemmas.lisp --&gt; centaur/esim/vltoe
centaur/vl/transforms/occform/* --&gt; centaur/esim/occform</pre> 
 
 <p>Various other files have also been moved into ESIM:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">centaur/tutorial --&gt; centaur/esim/tutorial
centaur/vcd --&gt; centaur/esim/vcd
centaur/regression --&gt; centaur/esim/tests</pre> 
 
 <p>Many other minor file-name changes have been made to help improve the 
 organization of the code base.</p> 
 
 <p>The various VL <i>flows</i> are also now better separated.  For 
 instance:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The ESIM flow no longer performs certain linter checks that are better 
 handled by VL-Lint.  For instance, it no longer generates a classic 
 use-set-report since the new Lucid reporting is much better.</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">vl model</span> command (based on the ESIM flow) is no longer used in 
 the module browser.  Instead, the module browser now reads <span class="v">.vlzip</span> files 
 that are produced by the <span class="v">vl zip</span> command, which is independent of 
 ESIM.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 
 <h3>Extended Support for Verilog/SystemVeriog</h3> 
 
 <p>The new VL (and in some cases VL2014) now have better support for at least 
 the following Verilog/SystemVerilog features:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 <li>
<span class="v">.*</span> connections that involve interface ports,</li> 
 <li>
<span class="v">return</span> statements in functions,</li> 
 <li>
<span class="v">inside</span> expressions like <span class="v">a inside {b, c, [d:e]}</span>,</li> 
 <li>
<span class="v">generate</span> constructs,</li> 
 <li>System functions like <span class="v">$bits</span> and <span class="v">$clog2</span>,</li> 
 <li>Unpacked dimensions in various contexts,</li> 
 <li>Matched <span class="v">end : foo</span> style endings on blocks,</li> 
 <li>Declarations on unnamed blocks,</li> 
 <li>Typedefs with a single unpacked dimension, i.e., <span class="v">typedef ... foo_t [3]</span>,</li> 
 <li>Ports whose expressions involve parameters,</li> 
 <li>Scope expressions and other complex hierarchical expressions,</li> 
 <li>Module level begin/end blocks (not in the spec but supported by simulators),</li> 
 <li>Package imports in block statements, functions, and tasks,</li> 
 <li>Certain complex assignment patterns,</li> 
 <li>The <span class="v">`"</span>, <span class="v">`\`\"</span>, and <span class="v">``</span> escapes in <span class="v">`define</span> macros,</li> 
 <li>Certain macro invocations in <span class="v">`include</span>/<span class="v">`ifdef</span> forms,</li> 
 </ul> 
 
 
 <h3>
<a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl::vl-lint</a> Improvements</h3> 
 
 <p>The loader works harder to attach parse-time warnings to the appropriate 
 modules.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <a href="VL____LUCID.html">vl::lucid</a> check is a far more capable check for unused, 
 unset, and multiply driven wires, with proper understanding of SystemVerilog 
 scoping.  The old use-set and multidrive warnings have been retired.</p> 
 
 <p>Heuristic improvements have been made to leftright checking, 
 extension/fussy size warnings for <span class="v">'1</span>/<span class="v">'0</span>/..., and duplicate instance 
 checking involving interfaces and portless modules.  Extension warning 
 heuristics are also now attachable.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the warning messages for zero-sized replications, overflowing 
 integer literals, and generally for warnings where expressions involve 
 parameters after unparameterization.</p> 
 
 <p>Portcheck now warns about stylistically undesirable ports such as 
 <span class="v">foo[3:0]</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>There is now a basic suite of system-level tests directed at the linter; 
 see the <span class="v">linttest</span> directory.  These tests have shed light on many minor 
 linter bugs.</p>
