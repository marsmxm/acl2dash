<p>Basic functions for working with ranges.</p><p>In Verilog, ranges are used in net and register declarations, and 
also in module- and gate-instance declarations to describe arrays of modules 
or gates.</p> 
 
<p>For gate and module instances, the Verilog-2005 standard is pretty clear. 
7.1.5 covers gate instances and 12.1.2 says that module instances have the same 
rules.  In short, neither side has to be larger than the other, neither side 
has to be zero, and it always specifies abs(left-right)+1 occurrences (so that 
if they're the same it means one gate).</p> 
 
<p>BOZO consider "negative" numbers and what they might mean.</p> 
 
<p>The specification doesn't give similarly crisp semantics to net and reg 
ranges.  Verilog-XL is horribly permissive, allowing even negative indexes and 
such.  But Verilog-XL indeed seems to treat w[1:1] as a single bit, and in the 
Centaur design there are occurrences of [0:0] and [1:1] and such.  So it may be 
that the semantics are supposed to be the same?  It turns out that there are at 
least some differences, e.g., you're not allowed to select bit 0 from a plain 
wire, but you can select bit 0 from w[0:0], etc.</p> 
 
<p>Historically, VL required the msb index is not smaller than the lsb index. 
But we now try to permit designs that use ranges that go from both high to low 
and low to high.</p> 
 
<p>The difference is that for a wire like <span class="v">wire [5:0] w</span>, the most 
significant bit is <span class="v">w[5]</span> and the least significant is <span class="v">w[0]</span>, whereas 
for <span class="v">wire [0:5] v</span>, the most significant bit is <span class="v">v[0]</span> and the least 
significant is <span class="v">v[5]</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Regardless of how the range is written, the wire behaves the same as far as 
operations like addition, concatenation, and so forth are concerned.  This 
might seem pretty surprising.  For instance,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire [3:0] a = 4'b0001;
wire [0:3] b = 4'b1000;
wire [7:0] c = {a, b};</pre> 
 
<p>Results in <span class="v">c</span> having the value <span class="v">8'b 0001_1000</span>.  Basically the way 
that the bits of <span class="v">b</span> are represented doesn't affect its value as an integer, 
and when we just write <span class="v">b</span> we're referring to that value.</p> 
 
<p>Where it <i>does</i> matter is when bits or parts are selected from the 
wire.  That is, <span class="v">b[0]</span> is 1 since its indices go from low to high.</p>
