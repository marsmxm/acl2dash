<p>Advice and tools for debugging performance problems and failed <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> proofs.</p><p>A GL proof attempt can end in several ways.  Ideally, GL will either 
quickly prove your conjecture, or disprove it and show you counterexamples to 
help diagnose the problem.  But things will not always end so well.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Capacity Problems</h4> 
 
<dl> 
 
<dt>GL is running out of memory.</dt> 
 
<dd>Symptoms: your ACL2 process is using too much memory and your machine is 
<i>swapping</i>, or you are seeing <i>frequent garbage collection</i> messages 
that seem unsuccessfulâ€”that is, few bytes are freed by each GC.</dd> 
 
<dd>There are <a href="GL____MEMORY-MANAGEMENT.html">memory-management</a> tools that may help to avoid these 
problems.  You may need to look into <a href="GL____OPTIMIZATION.html">optimization</a> techniques.</dd> 
 
<dt>GL has enough memory, but is running forever.</dt> 
 
<dd>You may be running into a bad case for GL's symbolic execution strategy, or 
your problem may be too hard for the back-end solver (BDDs, SAT).  See <a href="GL____PERFORMANCE-PROBLEMS.html">performance-problems</a> for some tools and advice for dealing with these 
situations.</dd> 
 
</dl> 
 
 
<h4>Other Problems</h4> 
 
<dl> 
 
<dt>GL is failing to prove coverage.</dt> 
 
<dd>Symptoms: You are seeing <i>failed ACL2 proof goals</i> after GL says 
it is proving coverage.</dd> 
 
<dd>It might be that your :g-bindings aren't sufficient to cover your theorem's 
hypotheses, or GL's strategy for proving coverage is misbehaving.  See <a href="GL____COVERAGE-PROBLEMS.html">coverage-problems</a> for advice on debugging this situation.</dd> 
 
<dt>GL produces false counterexamples.</dt> 
 
<dd>This is easy to identify because GL will print <span class="v">False counterexample!</span> 
and direct you to <a href="GL____FALSE-COUNTEREXAMPLES.html">false-counterexamples</a>.</dd>
