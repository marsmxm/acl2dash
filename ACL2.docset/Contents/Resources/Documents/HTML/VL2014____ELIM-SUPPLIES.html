<p>Elimination of <span class="v">supply0</span> and <span class="v">supply1</span> wires</p><p>In this transformation, we throw away declarations like <span class="v">supply0
a</span> and <span class="v">supply1 b</span>, and replace occurrences of <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">b</span> throughout 
expressions with <span class="v">0</span> and <span class="v">1</span>, respectively.</p> 
 
<p><b>BOZO.</b> This transformation is sort of okay, but we should come up with 
something better.  As it turns out, something as simple as eliminating supplies 
actually has some subtleties.</p> 
 
<p>A deficiency of our current approach is: what if someone tries to assign to 
a supply?  At best, they'll get some kind of message that says they're trying 
to assign to a constant, which won't be very informative.  Our approach also 
completely throws away the overwhelming strength of a supply, in case we ever 
want to try to do anything with that.</p> 
 
<p>We do not throw out any supply0 or supply1 wires which are also inputs or 
outputs to the module.  Instead, we convert them into regular wires!  This is 
crazy.  What are the semantics of an input that is a supply?  What if someone 
hooks up something that isn't supply-like to it?</p> 
 
<p>We annotate inputs that we convert in this way with the property VL_SUPPLY_0 
or VL_SUPPLY_1, so that some day we might do the most basic kind of checks that 
you haven't hooked up a bad wire to a supply, and so that the verification 
person may at least see that this input is supposed to have a particular 
value.</p>
