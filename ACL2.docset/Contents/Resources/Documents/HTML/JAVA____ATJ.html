<p>ATJ (<b>A</b>CL2 <b>T</b>o <b>J</b>ava) 
          is a Java code generator for ACL2.</p><p>This manual page contains user-level reference documentation for ATJ. 
     If you are new to ATJ, you should start with the <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL.html">tutorial</a>, which provides user-level information 
     on how ATJ works and how to use ATJ effectively. 
     Some of the material in this manual page 
     will likely be moved to the tutorial, 
     which is in progress.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>ATJ translates ACL2 to Java, 
     enabling ACL2 code to be used in Java code 
     (in the sense explained below).</p><p>For instance, ATJ is useful 
     to generate Java code at the end of an <a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a> program synthesis derivation.</p><p>This manual page provides reference documentation for ATJ. 
     A separate tutorial in being written, as noted above. 
     See the files under <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/java/atj/tests/</span> 
     for examples of use of ATJ.</p><h3>Scope</h3><p>ATJ translates ACL2 named functions to corresponding Java code 
     whose execution mimics the execution of the ACL2 functions.</p><p>The ACL2 functions accepted by ATJ may manipulate any ACL2 value: <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>, <a href="ACL2____STRINGS.html">strings</a>, <a href="ACL2____SYMBOLS.html">symbols</a>, <a href="ACL2____NUMBERS.html">numbers</a>, and <a href="ACL2____CONSES.html">cons pairs</a>. The Java code that corresponds to the ACL2 functions 
     manipulates Java representations of the ACL2 values.</p><p>ATJ accepts all the ACL2 functions that 
     (1) have either an <a href="ACL2____UBODY.html">unnormalized body</a> or an attachment and 
     (2) either do not have raw Lisp code 
     or have raw Lisp code but belong to a whitelist 
     (but also see the <span class="v">:ignore-whitelist</span> option below). 
     The ACL2 functions with raw Lisp code 
     are the ones for which <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RAWP.html">rawp</a></span> holds; 
     of these, the ones in the whitelist 
     are the ones for which <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PURE-RAW-P.html">pure-raw-p</a></span> holds. 
     The unnormalized body of the functions in the whitelist 
     is functionally equivalent to their raw Lisp code. 
     The Java code that corresponds to 
     the ACL2 functions that satisfy conditions (1) and (2) above, 
     mimics the computations described by their unnormalized body. 
     In the case of functions 
     without an unnormalized body but with an attachment, 
     (a call of) the attached function (on the formal arguments) 
     plays the role of the unnormalized body.</p><p>ATJ also accepts the ACL2 function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> 
     (which has raw Lisp code and is not in the whitelist), 
     but only when its first argument is 
     <span class="v">acl2::mbe-raw1</span> or <span class="v">acl2::progn</span>. 
     Calls of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a> 'acl2::mbe1-raw ...)</span> 
     are translated representations of calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span>; 
     ATJ translates to Java 
     either the <span class="v">:logic</span> or the <span class="v">:exec</span> part of these calls, 
     as detailed below. 
     Calls of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a> 'acl2::progn ...)</span> 
     are translated representations 
     of calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_42.html">progn$</a></span>; 
     ATJ translates to Java the last argument of these calls, 
     as detailed below.</p><p>ATJ also accepts all the <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">ACL2 primitive functions</a>. The Java code that corresponds to these ACL2 functions 
     has the input/output behavior documented for these functions.</p><p>ATJ accepts both logic-mode and program-mode functions.</p><p>Some ACL2 functions have side effects when executed, 
     e.g. <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HARD-ERROR.html">hard-error</a></span> prints an error message 
     and returns control to the top level. 
     All the ACL2 functions with side effects have raw Lisp code 
     and are not in the whitelist mentioned above. 
     Therefore, the generated Java code 
     does not mimic any of the side effects exhibited by ACL2 functions. 
     In particular, calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_42.html">progn$</a></span> are accepted 
     (as explained above about <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> 
     with first argument <span class="v">acl2::progn</span>) 
     only if their non-last arguments are free of side effects. 
     Support for translating ACL2 functions with side effects 
     to Java code that mimics those side effects 
     may be added in the future.</p><p>ATJ does not accept functions that access <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobjs</a>. Support for stobjs, and destructive updates of stobjs, 
     may be added in the future.</p><p>ATJ does not translate <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">macro definitions</a> to Java code. 
     However, the use of macros in function bodies is fully supported, 
     because ATJ operates on ACL2 translated terms, 
     where macros are expanded.</p><p>ATJ does not translate <a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">named constant definitions</a> to Java code. 
     However, the use of named constants in function bodies is fully supported, 
     because ATJ operates on ACL2 translated terms, 
     where constants are expanded.</p><p>The generated Java code can be called by external Java code, 
     but not vice versa. 
     The ability to have the generated Java code call external Java code 
     may be added in the future; 
     this may involve the use of ACL2 stubs corresponding to 
     the Java code to be invoked by the (Java-translated) ACL2 code.</p><p>External Java code can call the generated Java code 
     on (Java representations of) explicit ACL2 values. 
     Access to global variables 
     like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> or user-defined <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobjs</a> is therefore not supported; 
     in particular, the generated Java code has no access to 
     the ACL2/Lisp environment. 
     Support for global variables, in particular <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>, 
     may be added in the future.</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>ATJ is supported by <a href="JAVA____AIJ.html">AIJ</a>, which is a deep embedding in Java 
     of the executable subset of ACL2 
     (subject to the limitations outlined above).</p><p>ATJ translates the target ACL2 functions into Java representations, 
     based on their unnormalized bodies or attachments. 
     It does so recursively, 
     starting from the top-level functions specified by the user 
     and stopping at the ACL2 functions that 
     either are implemented natively in AIJ 
     or (under certain conditions; see below) 
     represent Java primitive operations or primitive array operations. 
     If a function is encountered that 
     is not natively implemented in AIJ 
     and has no unnormalized body and no attachment, 
     ATJ stops with an error. 
     If a function is encountered that has raw Lisp code 
     and is not in the whitelist 
     (except for the treament of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> explained above), 
     ATJ stops with an error.</p><p>ATJ generates Java code with public methods to 
     (1) initialize the AIJ's Java representation of the ACL2 environment and 
     (2) call the Java representations of the ACL2 functions 
     on Java representations of ACL2 values 
     (see the `Generated Java Code' section for details). 
     AIJ provides public classes and methods to translate 
     certain Java values to AIJ's Java representations of ACL2 values 
     and vice versa. 
     Thus, by loading into the Java Virtual Machine 
     both AIJ and the Java code generated by ATJ, 
     external Java code can ``use'' ACL2 code.</p><p>ATJ generates either deeply embedded or shallowly embedded 
     Java representations of the ACL2 functions. 
     The choice is controlled by a user option.</p><h4>Deep Embedding</h4><p>In the deep embedding approach, 
     ATJ generates Java code to build 
     the deeply embedded ACL2 functions, 
     and to call and execute them via AIJ's interpreter.</p><p>This deep embedding approach is simple and thus fairly high-assurance. 
     On the other hand, the Java code is not efficient or idiomatic. 
     However, the approach may work well for some simple applications.</p><h4>Shallow Embedding</h4><p>In the shallow embedding approach, 
     ATJ generates Java code that mimics the computations of 
     the shallowly embedded ACL2 functions, 
     one Java method for each ACL2 function. 
     These methods are executed without using AIJ's interpreter. 
     However, the shallowly embedded ACL2 functions still use 
     AIJ's representation of the ACL2 values 
     and AIJ's native implementations of ACL2 functions. 
     Under certain conditions, 
     the shallowly embedded ACL2 functions use Java values 
     that are not AIJ's Java representations of ACL2 values; 
     see below for details.</p><p>This shallow embedding approach 
     is more complex than the deep embedding approach, 
     but produces code that is more efficient and more idiomatic.</p><h3>General Form</h3><pre class="code">(<a href="JAVA____ATJ.html">atj</a> fn1 ... fnp

<p>Names of the target ACL2 functions to be translated to Java.</p>
<p>Each <span class="v">fni</span> must be a symbol that names a function that 
      either has an unnormalized body 
      and no raw Lisp code (unless it is in the whitelist; 
      but also see the <span class="v">:ignore-whitelist</span> option below), 
      or has an attachment, 
      or is natively implemented in AIJ. 
      Each of these functions must have 
      no input or output <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobjs</a>. 
      Each of these functions must transitively call 
      (in the unnormalized body or attachment, 
      if not natively implemented in AIJ) 
      only functions that satisfy the same constraints, 
      except for calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> as described below.</p>
<p>None of the <span class="v">fni</span> functions may be <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span>. 
      However, the <span class="v">fni</span> functions may transitively call <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span>, 
      under two possible conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> is <span class="v">acl2::mbe-raw1</span>, 
       i.e. the call results from the translation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span>. 
       Even though Java code is generated 
       for one of the second and third arguments but not for the other one 
       (based on the <span class="v">:guars</span> input; see below), 
       the restrictions on called functions, 
       and in particular the absence of side effects, 
       are enforced on all the argument of the call.</li>
<li>The first argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> is <span class="v">acl2::progn</span>, 
       i.e. the call results from the translation of 
       <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_42.html">progn$</a></span>. 
       Even though Java code is generated 
       for the last argument of the call 
       but not for the previous one(s), 
       the restrictions on called functions, 
       and in particular the absence of side effects,

</ul>
<p>If the <span class="v">:deep</span> input is <span class="v">nil</span> and the <span class="v">:guards</span> input is <span class="v">t</span>,

      one of the functions listed in <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA_____A2ATJ-JPRIMARR-FNS_A2.html">*atj-jprimarr-fns*</a></span>. 
      These functions are treated specially 
      in the shallow embedding when guard satisfaction is assumed (see below).</p>
<p>There must be at least one function, i.e. <span class="v">p</span> &gt; 0. 
      All the <span class="v">fni</span> names must be distinct.</p>

       in particular, only the <span class="v">:exec</span> part of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> is executed. 
       Furthermore, if the <span class="v">:deep</span> input is <span class="v">nil</span>,

      This means that any side effects that happen in ACL2 execution

</blockquote><h3>Generated Java Code</h3><p>ATJ generates a Java file that contains 
     a single public class named as specified by the <span class="v">:java-class</span> input, 
     in the package specified by the <span class="v">:java-package</span> input.</p><pre class="code">// if :deep is t:
public class &lt;name&gt; {
    ...
    public static void initialize() ...
    public static Acl2Value
        call(Acl2Symbol function, Acl2Value[] arguments) ...
}

// if :deep is nil:

        public static &lt;type&gt; &lt;fn&gt;(&lt;type&gt; ...) ...
    }
    // other public static classes with public static methods
}</pre><p>This Java class has a public static method <span class="v">initialize</span> 
     to initialize the relevant portions of the ACL2 environment. 
     This public method must be called just once, 
     before calling the other public methods described below. 
     This <span class="v">initialize</span> method should be also called 
     before calling any of the public methods provided by AIJ, 
     because AIJ itself relies on this initialization to work properly. 
     This method is actually empty, 
     but calling it ensures that the class is initialized: 
     it is the class's static initializer 
     that performs the actual initialization.</p><p>In the deep embedding approach, 
     the Java class also has a public static method <span class="v">call</span> 
     to call an ACL2 function on some ACL2 values. 
     The method takes as arguments 
     the name of the ACL2 function to call 
     and an array of ACL2 values, 
     and returns an ACL2 value. 
     The called ACL2 function must be among <span class="v">fn1</span>, ..., <span class="v">fnp</span> 
     and the functions that they transitively call, 
     or it may be natively implemented in AIJ.</p><p>In the shallow embedding approach, 
     the Java class contains public static methods 
     for the functions among <span class="v">fn1</span>, ..., <span class="v">fnp</span>, 
     the functions that they transitively call 
     (except for the functions in 
     <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA_____A2ATJ-JPRIM-FNS_A2.html">*atj-jprim-fns*</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA_____A2ATJ-JPRIMARR-FNS_A2.html">*atj-jprimarr-fns*</a></span>, 
     when <span class="v">:deep</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">t</span>) 
     and the ACL2 functions natively implemented in AIJ 
     (the latter are just wrappers of the native implementations). 
     Each method has the same number of parameters as the ACL2 function. 
     If <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     there is exactly one method for each ACL2 function; 
     that method's arguments all have types <span class="v">Acl2Value</span>, 
     while the return type is 
     either <span class="v">Acl2Value</span> if the function returns a single result 
     or <span class="v">MV_Acl2Value_..._Acl2Value</span> if the function returns <a href="ACL2____MV.html">multiple results</a> where <span class="v">_Acl2Value</span> is repeated for the number of results. 
     If <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, 
     for each ACL2 function there are as many overloaded methods 
     as the number of function types associated to the function 
     via <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-MAIN-FUNCTION-TYPE.html">atj-main-function-type</a></span> 
     and <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-OTHER-FUNCTION-TYPE.html">atj-other-function-type</a></span>: 
     each of these function types determines the argument and return types 
     of the corresponding overloaded method, 
     with each argument having the corresponding function input type 
     and the return type being 
     either the single output type if the function returns a single result 
     or <span class="v">MV_&lt;type1&gt;_..._&lt;typen&gt;</span> if the function returns <a href="ACL2____MV.html">multiple results</a> where each <span class="v">&lt;typei&gt;</span> is determined from 
     the corresponding function output type. 
     These methods are declared in nested public classes, 
     one class for each ACL2 package: 
     each function's method is in the corresponding package's class. 
     The mapping between these Java class and method names 
     and the corresponding ACL2 package and function names 
     is displayed if <span class="v">:verbose</span> is <span class="v">t</span>.</p><p>ATJ also generated a Java file that contains 
     a single package-private class whose name is 
     the name of the main class (described above) followed by <span class="v">Environment</span>. 
     This additional Java class contains code 
     to initialize the ACL2 environment: 
     this code is executed by invoking 
     the <span class="v">initialize()</span> method of the main class described above.</p><h4>Optional Test Class</h4><p>If the <span class="v">:tests</span> input (see above) is not <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     ATJ also generates an additional Java file that contains 
     a single public class named as specified in 
     the description of the <span class="v">:java-class</span> input above, 
     in the package specified by the <span class="v">:java-package</span> input.</p><pre class="code">public class &lt;name&gt;Tests {
   ...
    public static void main(String[] args) ...
}</pre><p>This Java class includes code 
     for each test <span class="v">(namej termj)</span> 
     specified via the <span class="v">:tests</span> input (see above). 
     The code for each test prints <span class="v">namej</span>, 
     evaluates the call <span class="v">(fn qc1 1c2 ...)</span> (which <span class="v">termj</span> translates to) 
     in AIJ (via the <span class="v">call</span> public method described above), 
     compares the resulting value with the one that ACL2 returns 
     (which is calculated when ATJ is run), 
     and prints a success or failure message 
     depending on whether the comparison succeeds or fails.</p><p>This Java class has a public static <span class="v">main</span> method that 
     calls the <span class="v">initialize</span> public method described above 
     and then executes the code to run the tests described just above. 
     Thus, this test class can be invoked as a Java application. 
     This <span class="v">main</span> method also prints a final message saying whether 
     all the tests passed or there were any failures. 
     If all the tests passed, the method exits the JVM with return code 0; 
     otherwise, it exits the JVM with return code 1, 
     which is an error code when the test class 
     is invoked as a Java application in a shell script.</p><h4>Java Version</h4><p>ATJ generates Java 8 code. 
     This means that the code can be compiled 
     using a compiler for Java 8 or later.</p><h3>Compiling and Running the Java Code</h3><p>The generated Java code can be compiled and run as any other Java code. 
     The <span class="v">.jar</span> file for <a href="JAVA____AIJ.html">AIJ</a> must be in the classpath: 
     this file is at 
     <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/java/aij/java/out/artifacts/AIJ_jar/AIJ.jar</span>. 
     The files <span class="v">compile.sh</span> and <span class="v">run.sh</span> 
     under <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/java/atj/tests/</span> 
     contains examples of command to compile and run the code. 
     See <a href="JAVA____AIJ.html">the AIJ documentation</a> for instructions on how to generate the <span class="v">.jar</span> file.</p><p>When the <span class="v">:deep</span> input is <span class="v">t</span>, 
     (the Java representations of) the ACL2 functions 
     are evaluated via AIJ's recursive interpreter: 
     evaluating recursive ACL2 functions on sufficiently large inputs 
     may cause a stack overflow error in Java. 
     When the <span class="v">:deep</span> input is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     recursive ACL2 functions are translated to recursive Java methods, 
     except for tail-recursive functions, which are translated to loops: 
     calling these recursive methods on sufficiently large inputs 
     may cause a stack overflow error in Java. 
     These stack overflow issues may be mitigated 
     by passing a larger stack size to the Java Virtual Machine 
     (via the <span class="v">-Xss</span> option to the <span class="v">java</span> command; 
     see the comments in the file <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/atj/tests/run.sh</span>), 
     or, when <span class="v">:deep</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     by making all the recursive ACL2 functions tail-recursive 
     (e.g. via <a href="APT____TAILREC.html">APT's tail recursion transformation</a>) prior to generating Java code.</p>
