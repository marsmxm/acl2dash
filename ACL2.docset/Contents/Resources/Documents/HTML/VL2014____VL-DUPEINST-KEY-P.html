<p>Keys used to determine if module instances have the same inputs.</p><p><span class="tt">(vl-dupeinst-key-p x)</span> is a <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">defaggregate</a> of the following fields.</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="tt">modname</span> — Name of the submodule being instantiated.  We need to know the 
             name of each instance so that we don't get confused by things 
             like 
 
             <pre class="code">mymod1 m1 (o1, a, b);
mymod2 m2 (o2, a, b);</pre> 
 
             which, despite having the same arguments, are presumably very 
             different things.<br>    <font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a> modname)</span>.</font>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">inputs</span> — Inputs (not outputs or inouts) to the submodule instance.  We 
             expect instances to be argresolved so that these are already in 
             some canonical order.  We just keep the expressions because we 
             don't care about port names, directions, etc.  We also expect all 
             of these expressions to be fixed so that attributes are 
             ignored.<br>    <font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-EXPRLIST-P.html">vl-exprlist-p</a> inputs)</span>.</font>
</li> 
</ul><p>Source link: vl-dupeinst-key-p</p><p>We generate a key from each modinst.  Modinsts with the same keys 
are regarded as having the same inputs.  That is, the whole point of the 
dupeinst check is to find modinsts with the same key.</p> 
 
<p>Our keys should arguably include the parameter arguments.  But if the inputs 
are the same, then the parameters should probably be the same or, at any rate, 
seem basically compatible?  Well, whatever.  It probably doesn't matter much at 
all in practice.</p> 
 
<p>We always hons keys because we're going to use them as fast alist keys.</p>
