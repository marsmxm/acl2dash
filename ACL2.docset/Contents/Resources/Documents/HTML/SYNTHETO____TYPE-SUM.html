</dl><p>This is like a disjoint sum of types, 
     where each summand has a name. 
     Each summand also has fields an an optional invariant, 
     i.e. it has a type product.</p><p>So a type sum is a sum of product types, specifically 
     i.e. not a sum of arbitrary types. 
     This is not a limitation of course, 
     because one can have a singleton product type. 
     This ``asymmetry'' between product and sum types 
     is typical of this kind of type systems, 
     including ACL2's FTY library, 
     which Syntheto provides a wrapper for.</p>
