<p>Static safety checking of the EVM dialect of Yul.</p><p>We specialize the static safety checks for generic Yul to the EVM dialect 
     by defining a function table for the EVM functions 
     and by using that as the initial function table 
     to check the safety of the top-level block.</p><p>The EVM functions are listed at 
     [Solidity: Yul: Specification of Yul: EVM Dialect]. 
     As noted in the text before the table, 
     they return either no or one value.</p>
