<p>Abstract placeholders for the Java floating-point 
          values [JLS:4.2.3], 
          operations [JLS:4.2.4], 
          and conversions [JLS:5.1].</p><p>Formalizing (Java) floating-point values and their operations is complex. 
     Many interesting Java programs do not use floating-point values; 
     these programs can be formally described by a formal model of Java 
     that does not (yet) include floating-point values. 
     Thus, for now our formal model of Java 
     does not formalize floating-point values and operations.</p><p>However, instead of saying something like 
     `there are no floating-point values', 
     our model says something like 
     `there are floating-point values, but we do not know much about them yet'. 
     This is achieved by introducing weakly constrained ACL2 functions 
     that recognize floating-point values 
     and capture operations and conversions on them. 
     These are analogues of the fully defined recognizers and other functions 
     over the ACL2 values used to formalize the other (i.e. non-floating-point) 
     Java primitive values and operations, 
     such as the recognizer <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SBYTE32P.html">sbyte32p</a></span> for <span class="v">int</span>.</p><p>Eventually, these weakly constrained ACL2 functions 
     will be replaced with fully defined ones that accurately capture 
     floating-point values, operations, and conversions. 
     This is expected to necessitate minimal (if any) adaptations 
     to the rest of our formal model of Java, 
     because the model already includes (abstract) Java floating-point values. 
     In contrast, if our current model omitted floating-point values altogether, 
     more laborious adaptations would be expected 
     when adding the floating-point values later, 
     e.g. functions defined by cases on the primitive values 
     would have to be extended to cover the newly added cases.</p>
