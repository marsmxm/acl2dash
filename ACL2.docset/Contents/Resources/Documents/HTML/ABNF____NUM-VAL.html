<p>In the abstract syntax, 
    we use lists of natural numbers 
    for the numeric value notations described in [RFC:2.3], 
    and pairs of natural numbers 
    for the value range alternatives described in [RFC:3.4]; 
    both notations are described by the rule <span class="v">num-val</span> (and sub-rules) 
    in [RFC:4]. 
    We abstract away the radix notations <span class="v">%b</span>, <span class="v">%d</span>, and <span class="v">%x</span>. 
    We also abstract away the restriction 
    that lists of natural numbers be non-empty. 
    This restriction is captured by the notion of <a href="ABNF____NUM-VAL-WFP.html">well-formed numeric value notations</a>, which also requires that the minimum of a range 
    does not exceed the maximum.</p>
