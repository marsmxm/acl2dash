<p>A <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>-based representation of four-valued functions as 
pairs of <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">aig</a>s.</p><p>A <b>FAIG</b> (Four-valued AIG) combines two <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">aig</a>s together 
to represent a function with four possible values.  Such functions can be 
useful in hardware verification.</p> 
 
<p>We represent an FAIG as the cons of two AIGs, which are called the 
<i>onset</i> and <i>offset</i> of the FAIG.  Our FAIG evaluation function, 
<a href="ACL2____FAIG-EVAL.html">faig-eval</a>, just evaluates these two AIGs, separately, using ordinary 
<a href="ACL2____AIG-EVAL.html">aig-eval</a>, and conses together the resulting Boolean values.  So, the 
four possible values of an FAIG are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">(nil . nil)</span>, which we call Z,</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(t . nil)</span>, which we call True,</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(nil . t)</span>, which we call False, and</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">(t . t)</span>, which we call X.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>We generally think of the onset as being a Boolean functions that should 
evaluate to <span class="v">T</span> when the wire is being driven to 1.  The offset is similar, 
but indicates whether the wire is being driven to 0.  So, the Z value 
represents a situation where the wire is completely undriven, and the X value 
represents a bad case where the wire is simultaneously driven to both True and 
False.</p> 
 
<p>Hons convention.  We ordinarly construct all AIGs with <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>, but we 
don't bother to hons the FAIG conses that put these AIGs together.</p>
