<p>Contributing changes</p><p><b>WARNING</b>: This is just a draft.  Suggestions for improvements 
 would be great; please send them to kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu</p> 
 
 <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: Before reading this topic, be sure to read the topic, 
 <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-MAINTENANCE.html">developers-guide-maintenance</a>.  The present topic assumes that you have 
 followed the process there to make changes in your copy of ACL2 and the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>, including testing and documentation.  Here are the steps for 
 contributing your changes when they are complete and fully tested and 
 documented.</p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li>Create your modifications by following the processes outlined in the 
 topic, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-MAINTENANCE.html">developers-guide-maintenance</a>.  Have you added at least one 
 release note item?  If not, then please look again at the topic, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-MAINTENANCE.html">developers-guide-maintenance</a>, where that and other prerequisites are 
 covered.</li> 
 
 <li>Create a tarball that contains your changes that are <i>NOT</i> under the 
 <span class="v">books/</span> directory.  For example, if (as is typical) those changes are all 
 in the top-level ACL2 <span class="v">*.lisp</span> source files, you can do the following while 
 standing in the ACL2 sources directory: 
 <pre class="code">tar cfz acl2-sources.tgz *.lisp</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Create a git branch on your local machine, called <span class="v">my-branch</span> below 
 (but give it a more descriptive name, for example, <span class="v">true-list-fix</span>): 
 <pre class="code">git checkout -b my-branch</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Commit your updates that are under <span class="v">books/</span>, but <i>ONLY</i> those 
 updates.  Be sure that the file with your commit message, <span class="v">tmp.msg</span> (or 
 whatever you decide to call it, but below it is called <span class="v">tmp.msg</span>), 
 describes your changes to the books.  The description can generally be brief 
 (use <span class="v">git log</span> if you want to see examples), often quoting your new release 
 note item. 
 <pre class="code">git add books
git commit -F tmp.msg</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Create your own GitHub fork if you don't already have one (for example, as 
 explained in the documentation topic, <a href="ACL2____GITHUB-COMMIT-CODE-USING-PULL-REQUESTS.html">github-commit-code-using-pull-requests</a>, Section (A)).  Assuming your GitHub 
 username is <span class="v">my-username</span> and (again) your branch name is <span class="v">my-branch</span>, 
 this should make your branch publicly accessible at the following URL: <pre class="code">https://github.com/my-username/acl2/tree/my-branch</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Push to your own GitHub fork, as follows: 
 <pre class="code">git push https://github.com/my-username/acl2 my-branch</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Send the commit hash and tarball (see ``Create a tarball'' above), as well 
 as the name and URL of your new branch (as discussed above), to an ACL2 
 author.  Optionally also send the commit hash for the version of master that 
 was your starting point.  As of this writing, those are to be sent to Matt 
 Kaufmann, at <span class="v">kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The last steps will be done by Matt, who will start by getting your 
 changes as follows, in a fresh directory. 
 
 <pre class="code">git clone https://github.com/acl2/acl2 .
git fetch https://github.com/my-username/acl2 my-branch:my-branch
git checkout my-branch</pre> 
 
 Note that after the <span class="v">checkout</span> command just above, <span class="v">my-branch</span> will 
 contain only your changes.  Matt will then install your source code 
 changes (from the tarball) into the branch, <span class="v">my-branch</span>, possibly make some 
 edits, and run an <span class="v">`everything'</span> regression.  When this passes, Matt will 
 run the following two commands, where <span class="v">tmp.msg</span> says something about the 
 changes, with credit to you.  Note that the <span class="v">commit</span> command will cause 
 <span class="v">my-branch</span> to contain all changes, both under <span class="v">books/</span> and from the 
 sources tarball, possibly after edits from Matt.  NOTE: Matt might instead 
 decide not to make any edits or run a regression before doing this, in which 
 case he will do those things after the merge below, as noted below. 
 
 <pre class="code">git commit -a -F tmp.msg</pre> 
 
 Finally, Matt will run a <span class="v">merge</span> command so that <span class="v">master</span> contains all 
 changes (both from <span class="v">books/</span> and from outside <span class="v">books/</span>), and then 
 complete the update to <span class="v">master</span> in the GitHub repository. 
 
 <pre class="code">git checkout master
# Get master up-to-date (this is just ``git pull'' with a check):
bin/pull.sh
git merge my-branch
# Possibly run ``regression-everything'' before the final push just
# below.  In fact this is critical if that wasn't done before.  There
# may be additional edits and additional commits to master before the
# push just below.
git push https://github.com/acl2/acl2 master</pre>
</li> 
 </ol>
