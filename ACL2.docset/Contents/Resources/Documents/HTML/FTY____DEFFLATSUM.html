<p>Introduce a fixtype for 
          the flat (i.e. not tagged) sum of disjoint fixtypes.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>This is a very preliminary tool for now. 
      In particular, it does not perform a thorough input validation.</p><p><span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a></span> introduces 
      a tagged sum of fixtypes, 
      some of which may partially or totally overlap 
      (the tags distinguish them in the sum); 
      it is like a disjoint union in set theory. 
      In contrast, this <span class="v">defflatsum</span> macro introduces 
      a flat (i.e. untagged) sum of fixtypes; 
      it is like a union in set theory. 
      However, the summand fixtypes must be pairwise disjoint, 
      so that the union is actually disjoint.</p><h3>General Form</h3><pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFFLATSUM.html">defflatsum</a> type

  )</pre><h3>Inputs</h3><p><span class="v">:type</span></p><blockquote><p>A symbol that specifies the name of the new fixtype.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">(:kwd1 type1)</span><br><span class="v">...</span><br><span class="v">(:kwdn typen)</span></p><blockquote><p>Two or more doublets, one for each summand. 
       The first component of each doublet is a keyword 
       that identifies the summand; 
       all these keywords must be distinct. 
       The second component of each doublet is an existing fixtype 
       that is a summand; 
       these fixtypes must be pairwise disjoint.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:pred</span></p><blockquote><p>A symbol that specifies the name of the fixtype's recognizer. 
       If this is <span class="v">nil</span> (the default), 
       the name of the recognizer is <span class="v">type</span> followed by <span class="v">-p</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:fix</span></p><blockquote><p>A symbol that specifies the name of the fixtype's fixer. 
       If this is <span class="v">nil</span> (the default), 
       the name of the fixer is <span class="v">type</span> followed by <span class="v">-fix</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:equiv</span></p><blockquote><p>A symbol that specifies the name of the fixtype's equivalence. 
       If this is <span class="v">nil</span> (the default), 
       the name of the equivalence is <span class="v">type</span> followed by <span class="v">-equiv</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:parents</span><br><span class="v">:short</span><br><span class="v">:long</span></p><blockquote><p>These, if present, are added to 
       the XDOC topic generated for the fixtype.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:prepwork</span></p><blockquote><p>A list of preparatory event forms. 
       See the `Generated Events' section.</p></blockquote><h3>Applicability Conditions</h3><p>In order for <span class="v">defflatsum</span> to apply, 
        in addition to the requirements on the inputs 
        stated in the `Inputs' section, the following <a href="ACL2____EVENT-MACRO-APPLICABILITY-CONDITIONS.html">applicability conditions</a> must be proved. 
         The proofs are attempted when <span class="v">defflatsum</span> is called, 
        using the hints optionally supplied as the <span class="v">:hints</span> input 
        described in the `Inputs' section.</p><p>The fixtypes <span class="v">type1</span>, ..., <span class="v">typen</span> must be pairwise disjoint. 
      Currently this proof obligation 
      is not quite explicated as a theorem to be proved, 
      but the generated <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">defflexsum</a></span> will likely fail 
      if the pairwise disjointness does not hold.</p><h3>Generated Events</h3><p>This macro generates a <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">defflexsum</a></span> 
      with some accompanying theorems:</p><pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">defflexsum</a> type

      it is copied to the generated <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">defflexsum</a></span>.

      all the predicates and fixers.</p>
