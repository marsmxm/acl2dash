<p>A mode that avoids <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> violations on <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">primitive</a>s</p><p>ACL2 has a special mode, called ``safe mode'', that guarantees that 
 built-in ACL2 <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">primitive</a>s check their <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s even even when 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span> has turned off guard-checking.  This mode is used 
 for macroexpansion as well as in processing a few other kinds of forms, 
 notably <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a></span> events.</p> 
 
 <p>Use of this mode avoids the possibility of certain errors when loading a 
 compiled file for a book.  Consider the following definitions.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> bar () (foo 3))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then we can see <span class="v">safe-mode</span> in action as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> nil)

Masking guard violations but still checking guards except for self-
recursive calls.  To avoid guard checking entirely, :SET-GUARD-CHECKING
:NONE.  See :DOC set-guard-checking.

ACL2 &gt;(bar)


ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  In the attempt to macroexpand the form (BAR),
evaluation of the macro body caused the following error:

The guard for the function call (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X), which is
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">OR</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> X NIL)), is violated by the arguments in the call
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> 3).  The guard is being checked because this function is a primitive
and a "safe" mode is being used for defconst, defpkg, macroexpansion,
or another operation where safe mode is required.  To debug see :DOC
print-gv, see :DOC trace, and see :DOC wet.

ACL2 &gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Notice that because of the <span class="v">set-guard-checking</span> call above, no guard 
 violation was reported for <span class="v">foo</span>.  However, <span class="v">safe-mode</span> caused the call 
 of the <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">primitive</a>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>, to be guard-checked, and a violation was 
 reported.</p> 
 
 <p>To understand how safe-mode works we refer to the notion of 
 ``executable-counterpart''; see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a> for relevant background. 
 ACL2 arranges for that for the executable-counterpart of any program mode 
 function, <span class="v">F</span>, then for every called subroutine <span class="v">G</span> of <span class="v">F</span> that is in 
 program mode, the executable-counterpart of <span class="v">G</span> is called rather than the 
 raw Lisp function for <span class="v">G</span>.  This may result in an attempt to evaluate a 
 so-called ``<a href="ACL2____PROGRAM-ONLY.html">program-only</a>'' function in safe-mode, which is illegal. 
 See <a href="ACL2____SAFE-MODE-CHEAT-SHEET.html">safe-mode-cheat-sheet</a> for possible workarounds.</p>
