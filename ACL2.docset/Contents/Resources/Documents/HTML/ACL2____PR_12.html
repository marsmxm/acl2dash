<p>Print rules stored by the command with a given command descriptor</p><pre class="code">Examples:

:pr! fn ; prints the rules from the definition of fn (including any
        ; :type-prescription rule and :definition rule), as well as all other
        ; rules created by the command that created by fn (which could be
        ; many rules if, for example, fn was defined by an include-book
        ; command).

:pr! :max ; prints all the rules stored by the most recent command</pre> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a>, which is similar but works at the event level instead 
 of at the command level.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">Pr</a></span> takes one argument, a command descriptor, and prints the rules 
 created by the corresponding event.  In each case it prints the rune, the 
 current enabled/disabled status, and other appropriate fields from the rule. 
 See <a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a> for further details.</p>
