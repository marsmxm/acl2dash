<p>Pretty-print warnings as they are created.</p><p>This is a debugging aide.  Usage is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt; (<a href="VL____VL-TRACE-WARNINGS.html">vl::vl-trace-warnings</a>)</pre> 
 
<p>This just traces <a href="VL____MAKE-VL-WARNING.html">make-vl-warning</a> in a fancy way so that warnings are 
pretty-printed to the terminal, automatically, whenever they are constructed. 
This may be useful, along with other debugging output, for figuring out why 
some warning is being constructed.</p> 
 
<p>This is just a macro based on <a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a>.  You can turn off warning 
tracing using <a href="ACL2____UNTRACE_42.html">untrace$</a>.</p>
