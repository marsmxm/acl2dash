<p>A <span class="v">vl-location</span> structure represents some location in a source 
code file.  These locations are attached to characters and module items to 
provide context during error reporting.</p> 
 
<p>Historically, <span class="v">vl-location</span> was an ordinary, tagged <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a> with 
three fields: a filename, line number, and column number.  Because there are 
many locations, this representation used a lot of memory.</p> 
 
<p>We now instead represent locations using a custom structure, essentially of 
the form:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(linecol . (:vl-location . filename))</pre> 
 
<p>Where the line and column number typically are only a single fixnum; see 
<a href="VL____VL-LINECOL.html">vl-linecol</a>.  It looks like this takes 2 conses, but we <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a> the 
<span class="v">(:vl-location . filename)</span> pair so that we only need one such cons per 
file.  So for all practical purposes, each <span class="v">vl-location</span> really only costs 
us a single cons.</p> 
 
<p>Despite this fancy representation, the interface to locations still acts as 
though it is a <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a> with just a filename, line, and column number. 
You can use the ordinary <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> binders and make/change macros to access and 
create locations, as you would expect.</p> 
 
<p>A downside of this representation is that <span class="v">vl-location</span> structures are no 
longer very readable when you encounter them in traces, etc.  However, the 
<span class="v">:vl-location</span> tag is still there, which allows <a href="VL____VL-FMT.html">vl-fmt</a> to understand 
when it has encountered a location, and to print these locations in a readable 
way.</p>
