<p>How to ensure that FGL can reduce your conjecture to a Boolean formula</p> <p>FGL is intended to reduce ACL2 conjectures to Boolean formulas 
that can be solved with a SAT solver.  The first step in this process is to 
reduce the variables of the theorem -- which could represent any object at all 
-- into a bit-blasted representation of some sort.  In GL, this was typically 
done by providing a shape specifier for each variable, and providing a coverage 
proof to show that the shape specifier was sufficient to cover all the values 
of the variable that satisfy the hypotheses of the theorem.  In FGL, shape 
specifiers are not supported (yet); instead, theorem variables are just 
variables, but rewrite rules can be used to extract a Boolean representation 
from them.</p> 
 
<h3>Generating Boolean variables</h3> 
 
<p>When the FGL interpreter process an IF term, it interprets the test of the 
IF, resulting in a symbolic object.  If that symbolic object is a function call 
or variable object, then we check the Boolean variable database of the 
interpreter state to see whether that object has already been bound to a 
Boolean variable.  If not, we add a new Boolean variable representing that 
object's truth value.  This is the only way that Boolean variables are 
generated in FGL.  An example of how this can be used can be seen in the 
following rule (from "fgl/bitops.lisp") for expanding the <span class="v">loghead</span> of 
some object:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FGL____DEF-FGL-REWRITE.html">def-fgl-rewrite</a> loghead-const-width
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> n))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a> n x)
                  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> n)
                          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="FGL____CHECK-INT-ENDP.html">check-int-endp</a> x (<a href="FGL____SYNTAX-BIND.html">syntax-bind</a> xsyn (<a href="FGL____G-CONCRETE.html">g-concrete</a> x)))
                               (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (intcar x))))
                      0
                    (intcons (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (intcar x) t)
                             (<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> n) (intcdr x)))))))</pre> 
 
<p>Applying this rule to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a> 3 z)</span> results in three new Boolean 
variables being generated due to the subterm <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (intcar x) t)</span>, which is 
really <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (intcar x) t nil)</span>.  The full expression reduces to a 
<span class="v">g-integer</span> form whose bits are the variables generated from <span class="v">(intcar
z)</span>, <span class="v">(intcar (intcdr z))</span>, and <span class="v">(intcar (intcdr (intcdr z)))</span>.</p> 
 
<p>So one way of getting from free variables to Boolean formulas that FGL can 
use is to access them through functions like <span class="v">loghead</span>, and to have rules 
like <span class="v">loghead-const-width</span> that rewrite those in a way that expose the 
Boolean variables that we want to reason about.</p> 
 
<h3>Normalizing Variables to Bit-blasted Objects</h3> 
 
<p>Often instead of accessing a variable only through accessors like 
<span class="v">loghead</span>, we'll have a hyp that describes the type of the variable.  We can 
use such hyps to reduce the variables to bit-blasted objects.  For example, we 
have the following rule in "fgl/bitops.lisp":</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FGL____DEF-FGL-REWRITE.html">def-fgl-rewrite</a> unsigned-byte-p-const-width
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> n))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> n x)
                  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> n)
                       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> x (<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a> n x))
                       t))))</pre> 
 
<p>When we assume <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 3 z)</span>, we end up with the formula 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> z (<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a> 3 z))</span>, but <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a> 3 z)</span> gets rewritten to a 
symbolic integer as described above.  Since this <span class="v">equal</span> term is in an IF 
test <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> z ...) t)</span>, we add a Boolean variable for it.  When we add 
a Boolean variable for an <span class="v">equal</span> term, we also can add an entry in a 
database that maps terms to Boolean variables that equate them to other terms. 
Whenever the FGL interpreter produces a symbolic object that has an entry in 
this database, we check whether any of those Boolean variables are currently 
assumed to be true, and replace that symbolic object with the object it is 
equated to.  In this case, we create an entry for <span class="v">z</span> in the database 
mapping it to the Boolean variable representing the <span class="v">equal</span> term.  Since 
this occurred as a hypothesis in the theorem, we're going to be assuming that 
to be true in the conclusion, so whenever we see the variable <span class="v">z</span> there 
we'll then replace it with the symbolic integer generated from the 
<span class="v">loghead</span>.</p> 
 
<h3>Pitfalls and Suggestions</h3> 
 
<p>Make sure the terms that are assigned Boolean variables don't alias each 
other -- otherwise proofs may end up having false counterexamples.  For 
example, if you generate a Boolean variable for both <span class="v">(intcar (intcdr x))</span> 
and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> 1 x)</span>, then you're likely to have false counterexamples where 
these two variables are assigned opposite values.  Choose a single normal form 
and rewrite other accessors to that -- e.g., use a rule like 
<span class="v">logbitp-const-index</span> to ensure that <span class="v">logbitp</span> calls are normalized 
correctly to <span class="v">(intcar (intcdr ...))</span> form.</p> 
 
<p>When taking the approach of normalizing typed variables to bit-blasted 
objects, it is important that the variable's correct type be assumed at each 
use of the variable.  That is, the assumption should be in a top-level 
hypothesis or else an <span class="v">if</span> test guarding each use of the variable (aside 
from the type assumption itself).  For example, the following probably 
works (depending what rules are installed):</p> 
 <pre class="code">(fgl-thm
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 3 x) (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 3 y))
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> y x))
    t))</pre> 
<p>But the following probably doesn't, or at least not by bitblasting:</p> 
<pre class="code">(fgl-thm
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> y x)))
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 3 x) (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 3 y)))
    t))</pre>
