<p>Free Variables in Top-Level Input</p><pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;<b>(equal (app (app a b) c)</b> 
              <b>(app a (app b c))))</b> 
 
ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  Global variables, such as C, B, and A, are 
not allowed. See :DOC ASSIGN and :DOC @. 
 
</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 does not allow ``global variables'' in top-level input.  There is no 
 ``top-level binding environment'' to give meaning to these variables.</p> 
 
 <p>Thus, expressions involving no variables can generally be evaluated,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;<b>(equal (app (app '(1 2) '(3 4)) '(5 6))</b> 
              <b>(app '(1 2) (app '(3 4) '(5 6))))</b> 
(1 2 3 4 5 6) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>but expressions containing variables cannot.</p> 
 
 <p>There is an exception to this rule.  References to ``single-threaded 
 objects'' may appear in top-level forms.  See <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.  A 
 single-threaded object is an ACL2 object, usually containing many fields, 
 whose use is syntactically restricted so that it may be given as input only to 
 certain functions and must be returned as output by certain functions.  These 
 restrictions allow single- threaded objects to be efficiently manipulated. 
 For example, only a single copy of the object actually exists, even though 
 from a logical perspective one might expect the object to be ``copied on 
 write.''</p> 
 
 <p>The most commonly used single-threaded object in ACL2 is the ACL2 system 
 state, whose current value is always held in the variable <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 provides a way for you to use <span class="v">state</span> to save values of 
 computations at the top-level and refer to them later.  See <a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> and
