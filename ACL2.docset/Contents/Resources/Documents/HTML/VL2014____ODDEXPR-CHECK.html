<p>Check for odd expressions that might indicate precedence problems.</p><p>This is some rough code for finding expressions that might have 
precedence problems.</p> 
 
<p>Consider the expression <span class="v">a &amp; b &lt; c</span>.  Due to the Verilog precedence 
rules, this gets parsed as <span class="v">a &amp; (b &lt; c)</span>.  Well, that might be quite 
surprising.  We try to look for expressions like this and, unless the code 
contains explicit parens around the <span class="v">(b &lt; c)</span> part, we issue a warning that 
it might not have the expected precedence.</p> 
 
<p>This has found a few good bugs!</p>
