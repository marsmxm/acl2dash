<p>(primitive) 
call the ACL2 theorem prover to prove the current goal</p><pre class="code">Examples:
prove -- attempt to prove the current goal
(prove :otf-flg t
       :hints (("Subgoal 2" :by foo) ("Subgoal 1" :use bar)))
      -- attempt to prove the current goal, with the indicated hints
         and with OTF-FLG set

General Form:
(prove &amp;rest rest-args)</pre> 
 
 <p>Attempt to prove the current goal, where <span class="v">rest-args</span> is as in the 
 keyword arguments to <span class="v">defthm</span> except that only <span class="v">:hints</span> and 
 <span class="v">:otf-flg</span> are allowed.  The command succeeds exactly when the 
 corresponding <span class="v">defthm</span> would succeed, except that it is all right for some 
 goals to be given ``bye''s.  Each goal given a ``bye'' will be turned into a 
 new subgoal.  (See <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> for an explanation of <span class="v">:by</span> hints.)</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> Use <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> t)</span> instead if you are not at the top of the 
 conclusion.  Also note that if there are any hypotheses in the current goal, 
 then what is actually attempted is a proof of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> hyps conc)</span>, where 
 <span class="v">hyps</span> is the conjunction of the top-level hypotheses and <span class="v">conc</span> is the 
 goal's conclusion.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> It is allowed to use abbreviations in the hints.</p>
