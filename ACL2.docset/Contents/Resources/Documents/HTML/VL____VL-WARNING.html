<p>Fundamental warning object used throughout <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a>.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>type — <a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>A symbol, most often a keyword symbol, that describes very broadly 
          what kind of warning this is.  There is no particular discipline or 
          strategy for assigning types to warnings, but the basic goal is to be 
          able to use these types to filter out or group up similar warnings.</dd> 
 
<dt>msg — <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>A more detailed message describing what went wrong.  This string 
          should be acceptable to <a href="VL____VL-FMT.html">vl-fmt</a>; it is similar to the "format 
          strings" used by ACL2's <a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> function, but there are some 
          important differences, e.g., not all <a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a> directives are 
          supported, and extra Verilog-specific directives are available.</dd> 
 
<dt>args — <span class="tt">ACL2::true-list</span>
</dt> 
<dd>Arguments that will be composed with the tilde directives in <span class="v">msg</span> 
          when the warning is displayed to the user.  That is, a directive like 
          <span class="v">~x0</span> refers to the first argument, <span class="v">~x1</span> to the second, etc.</dd> 
 
<dt>fn — <a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>A symbol, intended to be the name of the function that caused the 
        warning.  This is intended to be useful for VL debugging, to help make 
        the source of the warning more apparent.  Only good discipline (and 
        handy macros) ensure that this is correctly reported.</dd> 
 
<dt>fatalp — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Indicates whether this error is so severe that the module ought to 
            be thrown away and not subjected to further translation.  See the 
            general discussion in <a href="VL____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> for more information on how 
            this is used.</dd> 
 
<dt>suppressedp — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Indicates that this warning was suppressed by an ignore attribute.</dd> 
 
<dt>context</dt> 
<dd>Context object for this warning; should be NIL or printable with "~a".</dd>
