<p>Automatic documentation support for symbolic test vectors.</p><p>Symbolic test vectors are integrated into <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> so that you 
can generate attractive explanations of your setup.  This is often useful when 
communicating with logic designers.</p> 
 
<p><b>NOTE</b>: the topics here cover how we generate this documentation.  If 
you just want to document your own STVs, you don't need to know about any of 
thisâ€”just give a <span class="v">:parents</span>, <span class="v">:short</span>, or <span class="v">:long</span> argument to 
<a href="ACL2____DEFSTV.html">defstv</a>.</p> 
 
<p>These functions don't do much error checking.  We expect that we only are 
going to generate documentation after successfully processing the STV, so we 
generally just expect things to be well-formed at this point.</p> 
 
<p>The XML we generate is not documented in <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a>'s <a href="XDOC____MARKUP.html">xdoc::markup</a>, 
and is not supported by tools like <span class="v">:xdoc</span>.  How these new tags get rendered 
into HTML is controlled by, e.g., <span class="v">xdoc/fancy/render.xsl</span>.</p>
