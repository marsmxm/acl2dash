<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____LISPFLOAT">Click for Lispfloat in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A library for computing with (but not reasoning about) Common Lisp 
floats from within ACL2.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>ACL2 doesn't provide a floating point number representation or any 
operations for floating point arithmetic.  So if you want to use floating point 
numbers in ACL2, what are your options?</p> 
 
<p>One approach is to model floating-point numbers using some machine-like 
representation (e.g., as triples with a sign bit, some exponent bits, and some 
mantissa bits) and write ACL2 functions that carry out the desired FP 
operations on top of this representation.  This is done in, for instance, the 
<a href="ACL2____RTL.html">ACL2::rtl</a> library.  This approach is well-principled and has many 
advantages, e.g., it provides real logical definitions that can be reasoned 
about.  But it is also a lot of work and, for instance, RTL is a relatively 
heavyweight library.</p> 
 
<p>The <b>lispfloat</b> library takes a much less-principled but lighter-weight 
approach.  Our goal is not to try to specify how FP operations work, but merely 
to try to provide a pragmatic way to compute with floats by connecting ACL2 to 
the existing FP implementation provided by the Lisp environment.  The main 
issues here are how to represent floats in a convenient way for the ACL2 
program (since real floats aren't valid ACL2 objects), and how to provide a 
sound connection to the Lisp runtime.</p> 
 
<h5>Representation</h5> 
 
<p>To represent floats as ACL2 objects we just use rationals.  This is quite 
imperfect.  There are weird floats (infinities, nans) that don't even represent 
rationals, and positive/negative versions of zero that will both map to 0. 
There are also (of course) rationals that cannot be represented as floats 
without being rounded.</p> 
 
<p>But in practice this is still pretty good.  Any ``sensible'' float (e.g., 
normal, denormal, or the zeroes) can be turned into a rational and back without 
loss of precision.  And any FP operation that doesn't do cause an exception 
will result in a sensible number.  In short, if we start with sensible numbers 
and then only carry out reasonable FP operations on them, we should always stay 
in the realm of sensible numbers where using rationals works fine.</p> 
 
<h5>Operations</h5> 
 
<p>The floating point functions that we implement each take rationals as inputs 
and produce rationals as their results.  These functions might be called on bad 
inputs such as (1) rational numbers that we cannot correctly turn into floats 
because they are too big or would require rounding, or (2) arguments that cause 
the underlying FP operation to encounter some exception like an overflow, 
divide by zero, or similar.</p> 
 
<p>To identify these cases, each FP operation also returns a potential error 
message, which is either a string that describes the problem or is <span class="v">nil</span> 
when everything is OK.  The functions also have names like <a href="LISPFLOAT____ER-FLOAT_B2.html">er-float+</a> to 
remind you that they may encounter into errors.</p> 
 
<h5>Logical Story</h5> 
 
<p>We do not provide logical definitions for our floating-point operations, but 
instead introduce them with <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> and constrain them so that they 
are known to produce sensible results (error messages are strings or <span class="v">nil</span>, 
answers are rationals) and to satisfy basic <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">ACL2::congruence</a> rules for 
rationals for compatibility with the <a href="ACL2____FTY-DISCIPLINE.html">ACL2::fty-discipline</a>.</p> 
 
<p>By themselves, these logical definitions are just an ordinary <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> and hence don't require any trust tags.  You can load just these 
logical definitions by doing:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/lispfloat/ops-logic" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>However, note that these operations can't be executed until you load the 
executable versions, typically by including <span class="v">lispfloat/top</span>.</p> 
 
<h5>Executable Versions</h5> 
 
<p>We define executable versions of the operations as ``untouchable'' 
program-mode functions, which we then (using a trust-tag) redefine in raw 
Common Lisp and attach to the logical definitions.</p> 
 
<p>Once this has been done, you can run these functions to carry out floating 
point computations.  For example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/lispfloat/top" :dir :system)

ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="LISPFLOAT____ER-FLOAT_B2.html">lispfloat::er-float+</a> 1/2 1/2)
(nil 1)  ;; no error, answer is 1</pre> 
 
<p>Note however that you will still not be able to prove anything about the 
actual evaluations of these floating-point operations.  For instance, trying to 
prove a theorem like this will <b>fail</b>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 1 (<a href="LISPFLOAT____ER-FLOAT_B2.html">lispfloat::er-float+</a> 1/2 1/2)) 1))</pre> 
 
<h5>Supported Operations</h5> 
 
<p>We currently support single- and double-precision versions of the basic 
arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /), exponentiation of <span class="v">a^b</span> and <span class="v">e^x</span>, 
square root, sine, cosine, and tangent.</p> 
 
<p>We don't yet implement many operations that are available in Common Lisp 
such as arcsine, log, etc., because they can return complex numbers for some 
inputs and we haven't decided how to handle that yet.</p> 
 
<p>Other functions that are currently missing but would probably be mostly 
straightforward to add: basic inequality comparisons, round a float/double to 
the nearest integer, parse a string as a float/double (doesn't seem to be built 
into Common Lisp but there are Quicklisp libraries like parse-number), convert 
a float/double into a string, etc.</p>
