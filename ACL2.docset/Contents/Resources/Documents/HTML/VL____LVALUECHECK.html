<p>Checks to ensure that expressions used in lvalue positions are valid 
in the sense of <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-NET-LVALUE-P.html">vl-expr-net-lvalue-p</a> or <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-VARIABLE-LVALUE-P.html">vl-expr-variable-lvalue-p</a>, depending on the context.</p><p>Throughout our representation of Verilog/SystemVerilog <a href="VL____SYNTAX.html">syntax</a>, we just use ordinary expressions to represent <a href="VL____LVALUES.html">lvalues</a>.  In many 
cases our <a href="VL____PARSER.html">parser</a> is more restrictive than this suggests.  For instance, 
the parser will not accept syntax such as</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign a + b = c;</pre> 
 
<p>However, there are other places where a proper lvalue probably ought to be 
expected that we may not understand at parse time.  For instance, the arguments 
to the output ports of a module instance probably ought to be good lvalues. 
That is, if you have:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module myadder(output [3:0] out, input [3:0] a, input [3:0] b);</pre> 
 
<p>Then you should probably never try to write something like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">myadder adder1 (a + b, foo, bar);</pre> 
 
<p>Because then you're trying to connect the adder's output to <span class="v">a + b</span>, 
which is a lot like writing <span class="v">assign a + b = c</span>.</p> 
 
<p>So, in this simple <a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a> check we simply walk over the design and 
look for places where it seems like non-lvalues are being used where lvalues 
are probably expected.  This is purely heuristic so the warnings we generate 
are never fatal.</p> 
 
<p>We assume that at least <a href="VL____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> has been run.</p>
