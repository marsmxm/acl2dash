<p>We say whitespace includes spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns, 
form feeds, and vertical tabs.</p><p>The Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 grammars both define 
whitespace as follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">white_space ::= space | tab | newline | eof</pre> 
 
<p>We do not consider EOF a character.  Instead, it the condition encountered 
when the list we are processing runs out of characters.  The only place this 
seems to matter is in our handling of escaped identifiers, where we believe we 
account for it appropriately.</p> 
 
<p>Section 3.2 of the Verilog-2005 spec contradicts the above definition and 
says that whitespace also includes form feeds.  Section 5.3 of the 
SystemVerilog-2012 spec says the same thing.  Testing shows that Verilog-XL 
tolerates form feed characters as whitespace.  We therefore include form 
feeds (ASCII character 12, Common Lisp #\Page) in our definition of 
whitespace.</p> 
 
<p>It seems reasonable to also allow whitespace to include carriage 
return (ASCII character 13) and vertical tab characters (ASCII character 
11).</p>
