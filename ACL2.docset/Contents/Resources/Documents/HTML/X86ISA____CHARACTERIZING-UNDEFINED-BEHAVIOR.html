<p>An <span class="v">undef</span> field in the <span class="v">x86</span> state feeds unknown 
  values to processor components that are undefined</p><p>The <span class="v">undef</span> field is used to feed unknown values to 
processor components that are undefined, as per the Intel 
specifications.  For example, the <span class="v">SF</span>, <span class="v">ZF</span>, <span class="v">AF</span>, and 
<span class="v">PF</span> rflags are undefined after a <span class="v">MUL</span> instruction is 
executed.</p> 
 
<p>The principle behind the <span class="v">undef</span> field is quite like that of the 
<span class="v">oracle</span> sub-field of the <span class="v">env</span> field (see <a href="X86ISA____ENVIRONMENT-FIELD.html">environment-field</a>).  We describe our use of the <span class="v">undef</span> field by 
comparing it to the <span class="v">oracle</span> sub-field.</p> 
 
<p>For reasoning about programs that involve commonly occurring 
"undefined events" (like flag computations), using the <span class="v">oracle</span> 
sub-field can be quite tedious, since it has to be carefully 
initialized; i.e., a list of appropriate (symbolic or concrete) 
values has to be associated with the instruction pointer where any 
such undefined event occurs.  Imagine doing that for <span class="v">SF</span>, <span class="v">ZF</span>, 
<span class="v">AF</span>, and <span class="v">PF</span> every time a <span class="v">MUL</span> instruction is executed. 
The reason why we need this initialization is because the only way to 
access the <span class="v">oracle</span> is through the functions <a href="X86ISA____POP-X86-ORACLE.html">pop-x86-oracle</a> 
and <a href="X86ISA____ENV-READ.html">env-read</a>; <span class="v">pop-x86-oracle</span> expects the <span class="v">oracle</span> to 
contain information in a specific format, and <span class="v">env-read</span> will give 
us nothing unless we put something in to begin with.</p> 
 
<p>On the other hand, the <span class="v">undef</span> field doesn't require any such 
initialization.  The <span class="v">undef</span> field contains a natural number that 
is increased every time an undefined value is pulled for use (using 
the constrained function <span class="v">create-undef</span>) from a pool of undefined 
values; thus, every access of the <span class="v">undef</span> field causes it to 
contain a new value which is used to seed a unique undefined 
value. See <a href="X86ISA____UNDEF-READ.html">undef-read</a> for details.</p> 
 
<p>There is a reason why we enforced that tediousness in the case of 
the <span class="v">oracle</span> sub-field: it provides a way of tracking any 
computation that relies on the <span class="v">env</span> field. Such computations don't 
happen often, and when they do, it'd probably be better if we knew 
exactly what we are expecting from the environment.  Initializing the 
<span class="v">oracle</span> is a way of expressing these expectations. However, in the 
case of undefined values, we aren't really expecting anything from the 
environment.  All we want is a sort of infinite pool of arbitary 
values, seeded from <span class="v">undef</span> in our case, that we don't know 
anything about.  As such, we wouldn't be able to prove that a value 
obtained from <span class="v">undef</span> is equal (or not) to any other value, 
either obtained from <span class="v">undef</span> or not.  This is exactly what we need 
when reasoning about undefined values --- an undefined value is 
different from another undefined value, and also all the known 
values.</p>
