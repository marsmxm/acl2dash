<p>Analyzing Common Lisp Models</p><p>To analyze a model you must be able to reason about the operations 
 and relations involved.  Perhaps, for example, some aspect of the model 
 depends upon the fact that the concatenation operation is associative.</p> 
 
 <p>In any Common Lisp you can confirm that</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(app '(A B) (app '(C D) '(E F)))</pre> 
 
 <p>and</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(app (app '(A B) '(C D)) '(E F)))</pre> 
 
 <p>both evaluate to the same thing, <span class="v">(A B C D E F)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>But what distinguishes ACL2 (the logic) from applicative Common Lisp (the 
 language) is that in ACL2 you can <b>prove</b> that the concatenation function 
 <span class="v">app</span> is associative when its arguments are true-lists, whereas in Common 
 Lisp all you can do is test that proposition.</p> 
 
 <p>That is, in ACL2 it makes sense to say that the following formula is a 
 ``theorem.''</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><b>Theorem</b> Associativity of App 
(implies (and (true-listp a) 
              (true-listp b)) 
         (equal (app (app a b) c) 
                (app a (app b c)))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Theorems about the properties of models are proved by symbolically 
 manipulating the operations and relations involved.  If the concatenation of 
 sequences is involved in your model, then you may well need the theorem above 
 in order to that your model has some particular property.</p>
