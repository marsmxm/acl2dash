<p>Acl2 Version 1.6 Notes</p><p>A new key has been implemented for the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, 
 <span class="v">:ignore-ok</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-IGNORE-OK.html">set-ignore-ok</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now legal to have color <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, such as <span class="v">(red)</span>, in the 
 <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of a book.  More generally, it is legal to set the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span> in the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of a book.  For example, if you 
 execute <span class="v">:red</span> and then certify a book, the event <span class="v">(red)</span> will show up 
 in the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of that book, and hence the definitions in that book 
 will all be red (except when overridden by appropriate declarations or <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>).  When that book is included, then as always, its <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> 
 must first be ``raised,'' and that will cause the default color to become red 
 before the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in the book are executed.  As always, the value of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span> immediately after execution of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form will be the 
 same as it was immediately before execution (and hence, so will the default 
 color).  See <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> and, for more about books, see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A theory <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a></span> has been defined to contain exactly those 
 rules that are <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a>d when Acl2 starts up.  See <a href="ACL2____GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a></span> is now <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a>d, correcting an oversight 
 from Version 1.5.</p> 
 
 <p>Customization files no longer need to meet the syntactic restrictions put 
 on <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>; rather, they can contain arbitrary Acl2 forms.  See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION.html">ACL2-customization</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Structured directory names and structured file names are supported; see 
 especially the documentation for <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>, <a href="ACL2____BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Acl2 now works with some Common Lisp implementations other than akcl, 
 including Lucid, Allegro, and MCL.</p> 
 
 <p>A facility has been added for displaying proof trees, especially using 
 emacs; see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>There is a considerable amount of new <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>, in particular 
 for the printing functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT1.html">fmt1</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a></span>, and for 
 the notion of Acl2 term (see <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>It is possible to introduce new well-founded relations, to specify which 
 relation should be used by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, and to set a default relation.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION-RULE.html">well-founded-relation-rule</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>It is possible to make functions suggest new inductions.  See <a href="ACL2____INDUCTION.html">induction</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>It is possible to change how Acl2 expresses <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> information; in 
 particular, this affects what clauses are proved when <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>d 
 assumptions are generated.  See <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET-INVERTER.html">type-set-inverter</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new restriction has been added to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>, having to do with 
 undoing.  If you undo a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> and define the same package name again, 
 the imports list must be identical to the previous imports or else an 
 explanatory error will occur.  See <a href="ACL2____PACKAGE-REINCARNATION-IMPORT-RESTRICTIONS.html">package-reincarnation-import-restrictions</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">Theory-invariant</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-IRRELEVANT-FORMALS-OK.html">set-irrelevant-formals-ok</a></span> are now 
 embedded event forms.</p> 
 
 <p>The command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a></span> may now be used to quit entirely out of 
 Lisp, thus losing your work forever.  This command works in akcl but may not 
 work in every Common Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>A theory <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a></span> has been added that contains exactly the <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a>d rules in the <a href="ACL2____STARTUP.html">startup</a> theory.  See <a href="ACL2____GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Define-pc-macro</span> and <span class="v">define-pc-atomic-macro</span> now automatically 
 define <span class="v">:red</span> functions.  (It used to be necessary, in general, to change 
 color to <span class="v">:red</span> before invoking these.)</p> 
 
 <p>For a proof of the well-foundedness of <span class="v">e0-ord-&lt;</span> on the 
 <span class="v">e0-ordinalp</span>s, see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-OF-WELL-FOUNDEDNESS.html">proof-of-well-foundedness</a>.  [Note added later: 
 Starting with Version_2.8, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O_C3.html">o&lt;</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O-P.html">o-p</a></span> replace <span class="v">e0-ord-&lt;</span> 
 and <span class="v">e0-ordinalp</span>, respectively.]</p> 
 
 <p>Free variables are now handled properly for hypotheses of <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules.</p> 
 
 <p>When the system is loaded or saved, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> is now bound to 
 <span class="v">*the-live-state*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></span> has been modified so that when it compiles a file, it 
 loads that object file.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">Defstub</a></span> has been modified so that it works when the color is hot 
 (<span class="v">:red</span> or <span class="v">:pink</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>Several basic, but not particularly commonly used, <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> have been 
 added or changed.  The obscure axiom <span class="v">symbol-name-intern</span> has been 
 modified.  The definition of <span class="v">firstn</span> has been changed.  <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____BUTLAST.html">Butlast</a></span> is 
 now defined.  The definition of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGER-LENGTH.html">integer-length</a></span> has been modified.  The 
 left-hand side of the rewrite rule <span class="v">rational-implies2</span> has been changed 
 from <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NUMERATOR.html">numerator</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____F2.html">/</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DENOMINATOR.html">denominator</a> x)))</span> to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____F2.html">/</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DENOMINATOR.html">denominator</a> x))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NUMERATOR.html">numerator</a> x))</span>, in order to respect the fact that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNARY-_F2.html">unary-/</a></span> is 
 invisible with respect to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BINARY-_A2.html">binary-*</a></span>.  See <a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The `preprocess' process in the waterfall (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> for a 
 discussion of the <span class="v">:do-not</span> hint) has been changed so that it works to 
 avoid case-splitting.  The `simplify' process refuses to force (see <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>) when there are <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> terms, including <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a></span> 
 terms, in the goal being simplified.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">apply</span> is no longer introduced automatically by 
 translation of user input to internal form when functions are called on 
 inappropriate explicit values, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 3)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The choice of which variable to use as the measured variable in a recursive 
 definition has been very slightly changed.</p>
