<p>Java primitive values [JLS:4.2].</p><p>We formalize the Java boolean and integral values. 
     We also provide abstract notions of the Java floating-point values, 
     as a placeholder for a more precise formalization of them.</p><p>Our formalization tags the Java primitive values 
     with an indication of their types 
     (and, for floating-point values, of their value sets), 
     making values of different types (and of floating-point value sets) 
     disjoint. 
     This will allow us 
     to define a defensive semantics of Java 
     and to prove that the static checks at compile time 
     guarantee type safety at run time, 
     as often done in programming language formalizations.</p>
