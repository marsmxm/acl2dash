 <p>When ACL2 proves a lemma, it is converted into one or more <b>rules</b> and 
 stored in a <b>database</b>.  The theorem prover is <b>rule-driven</b>.  By 
 proving lemmas you can configure ACL2 to behave in certain ways when it is 
 trying to prove formulas in a certain problem domain.  The expert user can 
 make ACL2 do amazingly ``smart'' looking things.</p> 
 
 <p>But it would be wrong to think that ACL2 <i>knows</i> the mathematical 
 content of a formula just because it has proved it.  What ACL2 knows — 
 all ACL2 knows — is what is encoded in its rules.  There are many types 
 of rules (see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Many formulas can be effectively coded as rules.  But by the same token, it 
 is possible to encode a formula as a rule that is so ineffective it cannot 
 even prove itself!</p> 
 
 <p>The way a formula is stored as a rule is entirely up to the user.  That is, 
 <b>you</b> determine how ACL2 should use each formula that it proves.</p> 
 
 <p>The most common kind of rule is the <b>rewrite rule</b>.  It is so common 
 that if you don't tell ACL2 how to store a formula, it stores it as a rewrite 
 rule.</p>
