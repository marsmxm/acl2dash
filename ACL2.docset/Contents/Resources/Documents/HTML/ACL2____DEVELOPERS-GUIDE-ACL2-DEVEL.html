<p><font color="#c00000">Use the acl2-devel List!</font></p><p>For years, Kaufmann and Moore have had regular chats during which 
 they collaborate on development issues.  Use the acl2-devel mailing list to 
 continue that tradition.  For example, if you are trying to get oriented about 
 the waterfall and how hints interact with it, you could query the acl2-devel 
 list and maybe someone will point you to the documentation topic, <a href="ACL2____HINTS-AND-THE-WATERFALL.html">hints-and-the-waterfall</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>But please don't use the acl2-help or acl2 mailing lists for 
 developer-level discussions, as that can spook users.  The acl2-books list 
 also is not the right place; note that it is missing at least one important 
 member of acl2-devel.</p> 
 
 <p>This is the final topic under <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE.html">developers-guide</a>.<br>HAPPY 
 DEVELOPING!</p>
