<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____LEGACY-DEFRSTOBJ">Click for Legacy-defrstobj in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A predecessor of the <a href="ACL2____DEFRSTOBJ.html">defrstobj</a> library that wasn't based on 
abstract stobjs.</p><p>The directory <span class="v">projects/legacy-defrstobj</span> contains the ACL2 
source files for the original version of the <a href="ACL2____DEFRSTOBJ.html">defrstobj</a> library.  These 
ACL2 books may be built by running, e.g., <span class="v">make legacy-defrstobj</span> from the 
<span class="v">books/</span> directory.</p> 
 
<p>This legacy version of record-like stobjs was written by Jared Davis before 
ACL2 supported abstract stobjs.  As a result, many tricks and twists are needed 
to effectively hide the true nature of the stobj and to be able to treat it 
like a record.</p> 
 
<p>The legacy version isn't badâ€”we used this version of rstobjs for our 
microcode model at Centaur Technology for a couple of years.  But we eventually 
became irritated with how long it took to define rstobjs with many fields (it's 
quadratic in the number of fields).  It's likely that a sufficiently motivated 
person could speed this up, and we considered a way of doing so.</p> 
 
<p>But ultimately, we decided that with abstract stobjs, we could reimplement 
defrstobj in a much simpler way.  The new approach, implemented by Sol Swords, 
avoids this quadratic cost, and also has a couple of other nice features.  For 
instance:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>You don't need to "good stobj" predicate in your guards, because abstract 
stobjs basically give you that for free;</li> 
 
<li>You can use the record library's <span class="v">s</span> and <span class="v">g</span> functions directly, 
instead of needing "equivalent", stobj-specific functions.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>So today there is little reason to use the legacy version.  Use the new, 
more modern <a href="ACL2____DEFRSTOBJ.html">defrstobj</a> instead!</p> 
 
<p>Rather than delete the original version, we decided to put it into the 
<span class="v">projects</span> directory.  This is partly for posterity, but mostly:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>For pedagogical value.  The project's <b>groundwork</b> directory notably 
works through several demos, uncovering along the way the tricks that we need 
to support progressively more complicated stobjs as records.  This may be of 
interest to anyone who is interested in doing crazy things to avoid 
hypotheses.</li> 
 
<li>For regression-testing value.  This is a very elaborate use of stobjs, 
non-executablility, and MBE tricks, and may be a good exercise to put ACL2 
through as it evolves.</li> 
 
</ul>
