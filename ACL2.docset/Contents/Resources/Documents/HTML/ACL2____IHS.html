<p>The Integer Hardware Specification (IHS) library is a collection of 
arithmetic books, mainly geared toward bit-vector arithmetic.</p><p>This is a classic ACL2 arithmetic library wherein bit-vectors are 
represented as ordinary ACL2 integers, which has some nice efficiency 
properties.</p> 
 
<p>Despite the underlying integer-based representation, the library allows you 
to easily treat integers akin to lsb-first lists of bits, with the functions 
<a href="ACL2____LOGCAR.html">logcar</a> and <a href="ACL2____LOGCDR.html">logcdr</a> acting as analogues for <a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a>.</p> 
 
<p>To help you make use of this view, the library introduces alternate, 
list-style, recursive definitions for operations like <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a>.  Once you 
understand how to induct in the right way to use these definitions, it becomes 
an extremely useful way to prove theorems about these bit functions.</p> 
 
<p>The IHS library is found in: <span class="v">books/ihs/*.lisp</span>.</p>
