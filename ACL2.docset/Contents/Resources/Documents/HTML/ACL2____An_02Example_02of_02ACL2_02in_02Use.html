<p>An Example of ACL2 in Use</p><p><a href="ACL2____How_02To_02Find_02Out_02about_02ACL2_02Functions.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/walking.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>To introduce you to ACL2 we will consider the <span class="v">app</span> function discussed 
 in the <a href="ACL2____Common_02Lisp.html">Common Lisp</a> page, <b>except</b> 
 we will omit for the moment the <b>declare</b> form, which in ACL2 is called a 
 <b>guard</b>.</p> 
 
 <p>Guards are arbitrary ACL2 terms that express the ``intended domain'' of 
 functions.  In that sense, guards are akin to type signatures.  However, 
 Common Lisp and ACL2 are untyped programming languages: while the language 
 supports several different data types and the types of objects can be 
 determined by predicates at runtime, any type of object may be passed to any 
 function.  Thus, guards are ``extra-logical.''  Recognizing both the practical 
 and intellectual value of knowing that your functions are applied to the kinds 
 of objects you intend, ACL2 imposes guards on Common Lisp and provides a means 
 of proving that functions are used as intended.  But the story is necessarily 
 complicated and we do not recommend it to the new user.  Get used to the fact 
 that any ACL2 function may be applied to any objects and program accordingly. 
 Read about guards later.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is the definition again</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><b>(defun app (x y)</b> 
  <b>(cond ((endp x) y)</b> 
        <b>(t (cons (car x) </b> 
                 <b>(app (cdr x) y)))))</b> 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The next few stops along the Walking Tour will show you</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>how to use the ACL2 documentation,</li> 
 
 <li>what happens when the above definition is submitted to ACL2,</li> 
 
 <li>what happens when you evaluate calls of <span class="v">app</span>,</li> 
 
 <li>what one simple theorem about <span class="v">app</span> looks like,</li> 
 
 <li>how ACL2 proves the theorem, and</li> 
 
 <li>how that theorem can be used in another proof.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Along the way we will talk about the <b>definitional principle</b>, 
 <b>types</b>, the ACL2 <b>read-eval-print loop</b>, and how the <b>theorem 
 prover</b> works.</p> 
 
 <p>When we complete this part of the tour we will return briefly to the notion 
 of <b>guards</b> and revisit several of the topics above in that context.</p>
