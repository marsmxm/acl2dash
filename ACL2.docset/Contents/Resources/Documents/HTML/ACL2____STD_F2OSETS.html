<p>A finite set theory implementation for ACL2 based on fully ordered 
lists.  Some major features of this approach are that set equality is just 
<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a>, and set operations like <a href="SET____UNION.html">union</a>, <a href="SET____INTERSECT.html">intersect</a>, and so 
forth have O(n) implementations.</p><p>Osets mostly hides the fact that sets are represented as ordered 
lists.  You should not have to reason about the set order unless you are trying 
to exploit it to make some function faster.  Instead, we generally try to 
reason about sets with a membership-based approach, via <a href="SET____IN.html">in</a> and <a href="SET____SUBSET.html">subset</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The osets library offers some automation for pick-a-point style reasoning, 
see for instance <a href="SET____ALL-BY-MEMBERSHIP.html">all-by-membership</a>, <a href="SET____PICK-A-POINT-SUBSET-STRATEGY.html">pick-a-point-subset-strategy</a>, 
and <a href="SET____DOUBLE-CONTAINMENT.html">double-containment</a>.</p> 
 
<p>You can load the library with:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/osets/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>The definitions of the main set-manipulation functions are disabled, but are 
in a ruleset and may be enabled using:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE_A2.html">acl2::enable*</a> set::definitions))</pre> 
 
<p>Some potentially useful (but potentially expensive) rules are also left 
disabled and may be enabled using:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE_A2.html">acl2::enable*</a> set::expensive-rules))</pre>
