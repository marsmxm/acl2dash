<p>Run abc on an aignet, with a few different possible axioms about what comes out.</p><p>This function is identical to <a href="AIGNET____AIGNET-RUN-ABC-CORE.html">aignet-run-abc-core</a>, but takes 
one additional keyword argument, <span class="v">axiom</span>.  This argument specifies what can 
be assumed about the results.  The soundness of this assumption is highly 
questionable and dependent on the soundness of ABC and the appropriateness of 
the script it is run with.  The axiom may be any of the following; if it is 
anything else or is not specified, then nothing particular is assumed.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:comb-prove</span>: Asserts that if we produce <span class="v">:proved</span> as the status, it 
implies that all outputs and register nextstates of the input AIG are 
combinationally constant-true; that is, for any setting of the inputs and 
register states.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:comb-simp</span> Asserts that if we produce a non-error status (one of 
<span class="v">:proved</span>, <span class="v">:refuted</span>, <span class="v">:failed</span>, or <span class="v">nil</span>), and the output 
filename was given, that the output aignet is combinationally equivalent to the 
input aignet (see <a href="AIGNET____COMB-EQUIV.html">comb-equiv</a>).</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:comb-prove-simp</span> combines the assertions of <span class="v">:comb-prove</span> and 
<span class="v">:comb-simp</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:seq-prove</span>: Asserts that if we produce <span class="v">:proved</span> as the status, it 
implies that all outputs of the input AIG are sequentially constant-true 
starting from the all-0 initial state.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:seq-simp</span> Asserts that if we produce a non-error status (one of 
<span class="v">:proved</span>, <span class="v">:refuted</span>, <span class="v">:failed</span>, or <span class="v">nil</span>), and the output 
filename was given, that the output aignet is sequentially equivalent to the 
input aignet (see <a href="AIGNET____SEQ-EQUIV.html">seq-equiv</a>).</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:seq-prove-simp</span> combines the assertions of <span class="v">:seq-prove</span> and 
<span class="v">:seq-simp</span>.</li> 
 
</ul>

for these various assumptions, modulo the correctness of ABC.</p>
