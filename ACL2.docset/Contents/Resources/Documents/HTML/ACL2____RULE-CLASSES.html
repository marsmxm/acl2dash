General Form:
a true list of rule class objects as defined below

Special Cases:
a symbol abbreviating a single rule class object</pre> 
 
 <p>When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> is used to prove a named theorem, rules may be derived 
 from the proved formula and stored in the database.  The user specifies which 
 kinds of rules are to be built, by providing a list of rule class <i>names</i> 
 or, more generally, rule class <i>objects</i>, which name the kind of rule to 
 build and optionally specify various attributes of the desired rule.  The rule 
 class names are <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE-QUOTED-CONSTANT.html">rewrite-quoted-constant</a></span>,

 <span class="v">:well-founded-relation</span> (see <a href="ACL2____WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION-RULE.html">well-founded-relation-rule</a>).  Some 
 classes <i>require</i> the user-specification of certain class-specific 
 attributes.  Each class of rule affects the theorem prover's behavior in a 
 different way, as discussed in the corresponding documentation topic.  In this 
 topic we discuss the various attributes that may be attached to rule 
 classes.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that not all <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> generate rules.  For example, a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event that specifies <span class="v">:rule-classes nil</span> does not generate a rule. 
 Similarly, a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> event generates an axiom that can be referenced 
 by name in <span class="v">:use</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>, but it does not generate a rule.</p> 
 
 <p>A rule class object is either one of the <span class="v">:class</span> keywords or else is a 
 list of the form shown below.  Those fields marked with ``(!)''  are required 
 when the <span class="v">:class</span> is as indicated.</p>

 <p>When rule class objects are provided by the user, most of the fields are 
 optional and their values are computed in a context sensitive way.  When a 
 <span class="v">:class</span> keyword is used as a rule class object, all relevant fields are 
 determined contextually.  Each rule class object in <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> causes 
 one or more rules to be added to the database.  The <span class="v">:class</span> keywords are 
 documented individually under the following names.  Note that when one of 
 these names is used as a <span class="v">:class</span>, it is expected to be in the keyword 
 package (i.e., the names below should be preceded by a colon but the ACL2 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> facilities do not permit us to use keywords below).</p> 
 
 <p>See also <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>, <a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></span> for ``pragmas'' one can wrap around individual hypotheses of 
 certain classes of rules to affect how the hypothesis is relieved.</p> 
 
 <p>Before we get into the discussion of rule classes, let us return to an 
 important point.  In spite of the large variety of rule classes available, at 
 present we recommend that new ACL2 users rely almost exclusively on 
 (conditional) rewrite rules.  A reasonable but slightly bolder approach is to 
 use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> rules 
 for ``type-theoretic'' rules, especially ones whose top-level function symbol 
 is a common one like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span>; see <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> and see <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a>.  However, the rest of the 
 rule classes are really not intended for widespread use, but rather are mainly 
 for experts.</p> 
 
 <p>When in doubt, create a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule, which is the default. 
 See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES-INTRODUCTION.html">rule-classes-introduction</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Rule-classes</span> is an optional keyword argument of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> 
 (and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>) event.  In the following, let <span class="v">name</span> be the name of 
 the event and let <span class="v">thm</span> be the formula to be proved or added as an 
 axiom.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> is not specified in a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> (or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>) event, it is as though what was specified was to make one or more 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules, i.e., as though <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> 
 <span class="v">((:rewrite))</span> had been used.  Use <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> <span class="v">nil</span> to specify 
 that no rules are to be generated.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> class is specified, where class is a non-<span class="v">nil</span> 
 symbol, it is as though <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> <span class="v">((class))</span> had been used. 
 Thus, <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> is equivalent to 
 <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> <span class="v">((:forward-chaining))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We therefore now consider <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> as a true list.  If any 
 element of that list is a keyword, replace it by the singleton list containing 
 that keyword.  Thus, <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> <span class="v">(:rewrite :elim)</span> is the same as 
 <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> <span class="v">((:rewrite) (:elim))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Each element of the expanded value of <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> must be a true 
 list whose <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span> is one of the rule class keyword tokens listed above, 
 e.g., <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ELIM.html">elim</a></span>, etc., and whose <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span> 
 is a ``keyword alist'' alternately listing keywords and values.  The keywords 
 in this alist must be taken from those shown below.  They may be listed in any 
 order and most may be omitted, as specified below.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">Corollary</a></span> — its value, <span class="v">term</span>, must be a term.  If 
 omitted, this field defaults to <span class="v">thm</span>.  The <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> of a 
 rule class object is the formula actually used to justify the rule created and 
 thus determines the form of the rule.  Nqthm provided no similar capability: 
 each rule was determined by <span class="v">thm</span>, the theorem or axiom added.  ACL2 
 permits <span class="v">thm</span> to be stated ``elegantly'' and then allows the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> of a rule class object to specify how that elegant statement is to 
 be interpreted as a rule.  For the rule class object to be well-formed, its 
 (defaulted) <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span>, <span class="v">term</span>, must follow from <span class="v">thm</span>. 
 Unless <span class="v">term</span> follows trivially from <span class="v">thm</span> using little more than 
 propositional logic, the formula <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> thm term)</span> is submitted to the 
 theorem prover and the proof attempt must be successful.  During that proof 
 attempt the values of <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a></span>, and 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></span>, as provided in the rule class object, are provided as 
 arguments to the prover.  Such auxiliary proofs give the sort of output that 
 one expects from the prover.  However, as noted above, corollaries that follow 
 trivially are not submitted to the prover; thus, such corollaries cause no 
 prover output.  Note that no rule is stored for the theorem until all 
 corollaries have been proved.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that before <span class="v">term</span> is stored, all calls of macros in it are 
 expanded away.  See <a href="ACL2____TRANS.html">trans</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">Hints</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></span> 
 — the values of these fields must satisfy the same restrictions placed 
 on the fields of the same names in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>.  These values are passed to 
 the recursive call of the prover used to establish that the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> of the rule class object follows from the theorem or axiom 
 <span class="v">thm</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">Type-set</a></span> — this field may be supplied only if the 
 <span class="v">:class</span> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET-INVERTER.html">type-set-inverter</a></span>.  When provided, the value must 
 be a type-set, an integer in a certain range.  If not provided, an attempt is 
 made to compute it from the corollary.  See <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET-INVERTER.html">type-set-inverter</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Typed-term</span> — this field may be supplied only if the <span class="v">:class</span> 
 is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span>.  When provided, the value is the term for 
 which the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> is a type-prescription lemma.  If no 
 <span class="v">:typed-term</span> is provided in a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule class 
 object, we try to compute heuristically an acceptable term.  See <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Trigger-terms</span> — this field may be supplied only if the 
 <span class="v">:class</span> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>.  When 
 provided, the value is a list of terms, each of which is to trigger the 
 attempted application of the rule.  If no <span class="v">:trigger-terms</span> is provided, we 
 attempt to compute heuristically an appropriate set of triggers.  See <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> or see <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Trigger-fns</span> — this field must (and may only) be supplied if the 
 <span class="v">:class</span> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span>.  Its value must be a list of function 
 symbols (except that a macro alias can stand in for a function symbol; see 
 <a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a>).  Terms with these symbols trigger the application of 
 the rule.  See <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Well-formedness-guarantee</span> — this field may be supplied only if 
 the <span class="v">:class</span> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a></span>.  Its 
 value must be of one of the following forms:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">[1]  thm-name1                ; :META or :CLAUSE-PROCESSOR rules
[2]  (thm-name1)              ; :META rules
[3]  (thm-name1 thm-name2)    ; :META rules</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">thm-name1</span> and <span class="v">thm-name2</span> are the names of previously proved 
 theorems establishing that the results of applying the metafunction(s) or 
 clause-processor will be syntactically well-formed.  See <span class="v">:</span><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> and 
 <span class="v">:</span><a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a> for details of the required forms of these 
 well-formedness theorems.  Forms [1] and [2] may be used for <span class="v">:meta</span> rules 
 where no hypothesis metafunction is involved.  Form [3] must be used for 
 <span class="v">:meta</span> rules with hypothesis metafunctions; that is, if you provide a 
 well-formedness guarantee for a metatheorem with a hypothesis metafunction you 
 must guarantee the well-formedness of both the metafunction (with 
 <span class="v">thm-name1</span>) and the hypothesis metafunction (with <span class="v">thm-name2</span>).  Form 
 [1] must be used for <span class="v">:clause-processor</span> rules.  In the absence of a proper 
 <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span> the well-formedness of the output of a both 
 kinds of rules is checked every time the rule is fired.  These checks are 
 skipped when a proper <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span> is provided or when 
 overridden as described in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-SKIP-META-TERMP-CHECKS.html">set-skip-meta-termp-checks</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Clique</span> and <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> — these two fields may only 
 be supplied if the <span class="v">:class</span> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>.  If they are 
 omitted, then ACL2 will attempt to guess them.  Suppose the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> of the rule is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> hyp (equiv (fn a1 ... an) body))</span>.  The 
 value of the <span class="v">:clique</span> field should be a true list of function symbols, and 
 if non-<span class="v">nil</span> must include <span class="v">fn</span>.  These symbols are all the members of 
 the mutually recursive clique containing this definition of <span class="v">fn</span>.  That is, 
 a call of any function in <span class="v">:clique</span> is considered a ``recursive call'' for 
 purposes of the expansion heuristics.  The value of the <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> 
 field should be an alist that maps each function symbol in the <span class="v">:clique</span> to 
 a list of <span class="v">t</span>'s and <span class="v">nil</span>'s of length equal to the arity of the 
 function.  For example, if <span class="v">:clique</span> consists of just two symbols, <span class="v">fn1</span> 
 and <span class="v">fn2</span>, of arities <span class="v">2</span> and <span class="v">3</span> respectively, then <span class="v">((fn1 t nil)
 (fn2 nil t t))</span> is a legal value of <span class="v">:controller-alist</span>.  The value 
 associated with a function symbol in this alist is a ``mask'' specifying which 
 argument slots of the function ``control'' the recursion for heuristic 
 purposes.  Sloppy choice of <span class="v">:clique</span> or <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> can result 
 in infinite expansion and stack overflow.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Install-body</span> — this field may only be supplied if the 
 <span class="v">:class</span> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>.  Its value must be <span class="v">t</span>, <span class="v">nil</span>, 
 or the default, <span class="v">:normalize</span>.  A value of <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">:normalize</span> will 
 cause ACL2 to install this rule as the new body of the function being 
 ``defined'' (<span class="v">fn</span> in the paragraph just above); hence this definition will 
 be installed for future <span class="v">:expand</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  Furthermore, if this field 
 is omitted or the value is <span class="v">:normalize</span>, then this definition will be 
 simplified with the <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZATION.html">normalization</a> procedure that is used by default 
 when processing definitions made with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.  You must explicitly 
 specify <span class="v">:install-body nil</span> in the following cases: the arguments are not a 
 list of distinct variables, <span class="v">equiv</span> (as above) is not <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>, or 
 there are free variables in the hypotheses or right-hand side (see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>).  However, supplying <span class="v">:install-body nil</span> will not affect 
 the rewriter's application of the <span class="v">:definition</span> rule, other than to avoid 
 using the rule to apply <span class="v">:expand</span> hints.  If a definition rule equates 
 <span class="v">(f a1 ... ak)</span> with <span class="v">body</span> but there are hypotheses, <span class="v">hyps</span>, then 
 <span class="v">:expand</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> will replace terms <span class="v">(f term1 ... termk)</span> by 
 corresponding terms <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> hyps body (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (f term1 ... termk)))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">Loop-stopper</a></span> — this field may only be supplied if the 
 class is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE-QUOTED-CONSTANT.html">rewrite-quoted-constant</a></span>.  Its 
 value must be a list of entries each consisting of two variables followed by 
 a (possibly empty) list of function symbols, for example <span class="v">((x y binary-+) (<a href="ACL2____U.html">u</a>
 v foo bar))</span>.  It will be used to restrict application of rewrite rules by 
 requiring that the list of instances of the second variables must be 
 ``smaller'' than the list of instances of the first variables in a sense 
 related to the corresponding functions listed; see <a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a>.  The 
 list as a whole is allowed to be <span class="v">nil</span>, indicating that no such restriction 
 shall be made.  Note that any such entry that contains a variable not being 
 instantiated, i.e., not occurring on the left side of the rewrite rule, will 
 be ignored.  However, for simplicity we merely require that every variable 
 mentioned should appear somewhere in the corresponding <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> 
 formula.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Pattern</span>, <span class="v">:Condition</span>, <span class="v">:Scheme</span> — the first and last of 
 these fields must (and may only) be supplied if the class is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INDUCTION.html">induction</a></span>.  <span class="v">:Condition</span> is optional but may only be supplied if the class 
 is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INDUCTION.html">induction</a></span>.  The values must all be terms and indicate, 
 respectively, the pattern to which a new induction scheme is to be attached, 
 the condition under which the suggestion is to be made, and a term which 
 suggests the new scheme.  See <a href="ACL2____INDUCTION.html">induction</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Match-free</span> — this field must be <span class="v">:all</span> or <span class="v">:once</span> and may 
 be supplied only if the <span class="v">:class</span> is either <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>, or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span>.  (This field is not 
 implemented for other rule classes, including the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule class.)  See <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a> for a description 
 of this field.  Note: Although this field is intended to be used for 
 controlling retries of matching free variables in hypotheses, it is legal to 
 supply it even if there are no such free variables.  This can simplify the 
 automated generation of rules, but note that when <span class="v">:match-free</span> is 
 supplied, the warning otherwise provided for the presence of free variables in 
 hypotheses will be suppressed.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Backchain-limit-lst</span> — this field may be supplied only if the 
 <span class="v">:class</span> is either <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>, or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span>.  It is further required that 
 either only one rule is generated from the formula or, at least, every such 
 rule has the same list of hypotheses.  The value for <span class="v">:backchain-limit-lst</span> 
 must be <span class="v">nil</span>; a non-negative integer; or, except in the case of 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> rules, a true list each element of which is either <span class="v">nil</span> 
 or a non-negative integer.  If it is a list, its length must be equal to the 
 number of hypotheses of the rule and each item in the list is the ``backchain 
 limit'' associated with the corresponding hypothesis.  If 
 <span class="v">backchain-limit-lst</span> is a non-negative integer, it is defaulted to a list 
 of the appropriate number of repetitions of that integer.  The backchain limit 
 of a hypothesis is used to limit the effort that ACL2 will expend when 
 relieving the hypothesis.  If it is <span class="v">NIL</span>, no new limits are imposed; if it 
 is an integer, the hypothesis will be limited to backchaining at most that 
 many times.  Note that backchaining may be further limited by a global 
 <span class="v">backchain-limit</span>; see <a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> for details.  For different 
 ways to reign in the rewriter, see <a href="ACL2____REWRITE-STACK-LIMIT.html">rewrite-stack-limit</a> and see <a href="ACL2____SET-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">set-prover-step-limit</a>.  Jared Davis has pointed out that you can set the 
 <span class="v">:backchain-limit-lst</span> to 0 to avoid any attempt to relieve <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d 
 hypotheses, which can lead to a significant speed-up in some cases.</p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>Once <span class="v">thm</span> has been proved (in the case of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>) and each rule 
 class object has been checked for well-formedness (which might require 
 additional proofs), we consider each rule class object in turn to generate and 
 add rules.  Let <span class="v">:class</span> be the class keyword token of the <span class="v">i</span>th class 
 object (counting from left to right).  Generate the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> <span class="v">(:class
 name . x)</span>, where <span class="v">x</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> if there is only one class and otherwise 
 <span class="v">x</span> is <span class="v">i</span>.  Then, from the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> of that object, 
 generate one or more rules, each of which has the name <span class="v">(:class name . x)</span>. 
 See the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> entry for each rule class to see how formulas 
 determine rules.  Note that it is in principle possible for several rules to 
 share the same name; it happens whenever a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> determines 
 more than one rule.  This in fact only occurs for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>, and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> class rules and only 
 then if the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> is essentially a conjunction.  (See the 
 documentation for <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, or <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> 
 for details.)</p>
