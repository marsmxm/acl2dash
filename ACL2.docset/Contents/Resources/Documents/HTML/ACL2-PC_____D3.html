<p>(atomic macro) 
attempt an equality (or equivalence) substitution</p><pre class="code">Examples:
=     -- replace the current subterm by a term equated to it in
         one of the hypotheses (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> such a term exists)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> x) -- replace the current subterm by x, assuming that the prover
         can show that they are equal
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) z)
      -- replace the term (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) by the term z inside the current
         subterm, assuming that the prover can prove
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) z) from the current top-level hypotheses
         or that this term or (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> z (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y)) is among the
         current top-level hypotheses or the current governors
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> &amp; z)
      -- exactly the same as above, if (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) is the current
         subterm
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) z :hints :none)
      -- same as (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) z), except that a new subgoal is
         created with the current goal's hypotheses and governors
         as its top-level hypotheses and (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) z) as its
         conclusion
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) z 0)
      -- exactly the same as immediately above
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> (p x)
   (p y)
   :equiv iff
   :otf-flg t
   :hints (("Subgoal 2" :BY FOO) ("Subgoal 1" :use bar)))
      -- same as (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) z), except that the prover uses
         the indicated values for otf-flg and hints, and only
         propositional (<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a>) equivalence is used (however, it
         must be that only propositional equivalence matters at
         the current subterm)

General Forms:
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> x)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> x y)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> x y :kwd1 val1 ... :kwdn valn)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> x y atom :kwd1 val1 ... :kwdn valn)</pre> 
 
 <p>where each <span class="v">:kwdi</span> is one of <span class="v">:hints</span>, <span class="v">:otf-flg</span>, or <span class="v">:equiv</span>, 
 without repetition.  In the last form, <span class="v">atom</span> is a non-keyword atom and no 
 <span class="v">kwdi</span> may be <span class="v">:hints</span>; that atom, if supplied, is equivalent to 
 <span class="v">:hints atom</span>, which indicates that instead of performing a proof that the 
 two indicated terms (as described below) are suitably equivalent, a new such 
 goal is created.</p> 
 
 <p>If terms <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span> are supplied, then replace <span class="v">x</span> by <span class="v">y</span> 
 inside the current subterm if they are ``known'' to be equal, or more 
 generally, equivalent in the sense described below.  Here ``known'' means the 
 following: except in the cases that no arguments are provided or else 
 <span class="v">:hints atom</span> is provided as described above, the prover is called as in 
 the <span class="v">prove</span> command (using keyword arguments <span class="v">:otf</span> and <span class="v">:hints</span>, if 
 supplied, where the value of <span class="v">:hints</span> is not an atom) to prove equivalence 
 of <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span> under the current governors and top-level hypotheses.  By 
 default, this equivalence is equality; however the keyword argument 
 <span class="v">:equiv</span> can specify a known equivalence relation.  In cases other than 
 equality, substitution only takes place where justified by the equivlance 
 maintained at the current subterm.</p> 
 
 <p>For the keyword arguments, <span class="v">:equiv</span> defaults to <span class="v">equal</span> if not 
 supplied or <span class="v">nil</span>; if it is not <span class="v">equal</span> (either explicitly or by 
 default), then it should be the name of a known ACL2 <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> 
 relation, and substitution will only take place at subterm occurrences for 
 which the <span class="v">:equiv</span> is among the <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relations being 
 maintained without the use of <a href="ACL2____PATTERNED-CONGRUENCE.html">patterned-congruence</a>s.</p> 
 
 <h3>Remarks on defaults</h3> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>If there are at least two arguments, then <span class="v">x</span> may be the symbol 
 <span class="v">&amp;</span>, in any package except the keyword package, which represents the 
 current subterm.</li> 
 
 <li>The one-argument command <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> a)</span> is equivalent to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> &amp; a)</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>If there are no arguments, then we look for a top-level hypothesis or a 
 governor of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> c u)</span> or <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> u c)</span>, where <span class="v">c</span> is the 
 current subterm.  In that case we replace the current subterm by <span class="v">u</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>As with the <span class="v">prove</span> command, we allow goals to be given ``bye''s in the 
 proof, which may be generated by a <span class="v">:hints</span> keyword argument in 
 <span class="v">keyword-args</span>.  These result in the creation of new subgoals.</li> 
 
 <li>It is allowed to use abbreviations (see <a href="ACL2-PC____ADD-ABBREVIATION.html">ACL2-pc::add-abbreviation</a>) 
 in the hints.</li> 
 
 </ul>
