<p>The Common Lisp entry to ACL2</p><p>To enter the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> loop from Common Lisp, call the 
 Common Lisp program <span class="v">lp</span> (which stands for ``loop,'' as in 
 ``read-eval-print loop'' or ``<a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> loop.'')  The ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> 
 loop is actually coded in ACL2 as the function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> (which stands for 
 ``load'').  The <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> loop is just what you get by loading from the 
 standard object input channel, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2STANDARD-OI_A2.html">*standard-oi*</a></span>.  Calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> 
 directly from Common Lisp is possible but fragile because hard lisp errors or 
 aborts throw you out of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> and back to the top-level of Common Lisp. 
 <span class="v">Lp</span> calls <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> in such a way as to prevent this and is thus the 
 standard way to get into the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> loop.  Also see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION.html">ACL2-customization</a> for information on the loading of an initialization 
 file.</p> 
 
 <p>All of the visible functionality of <span class="v">lp</span> is in fact provided by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>, which is written in ACL2 itself.  Therefore, you should see <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> for 
 detailed <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> of the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> loop.  We sketch it 
 below, for novice users.</p> 
 
 <p>Every expression typed to the ACL2 top-level must be an ACL2 
 expression.</p> 
 
 <p>Any ACL2 expression may be submitted for evaluation.  Well-formedness is 
 checked.  Some well-formed expressions cannot be evaluated because they 
 involve (at some level) undefined constrained functions (see <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>).  In addition, ACL2 does not allow ``global variables'' in 
 expressions to be evaluated.  Thus, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> '(a b c))</span> is legal and evaluates 
 to <span class="v">A</span>, but <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)</span> is not, because there is no ``global context'' or 
 binding environment that gives meaning to the variable symbol <span class="v">x</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>There is an exception to the global variable rule outlined above: 
 single-threaded objects (see <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>) may be used as global variables in 
 top-level expressions.  The most commonly used such object is the ACL2 
 ``current state,'' which is the value of the variable symbol <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>. 
 This variable may occur in the top-level form to be evaluated, but must be 
 passed only to ACL2 functions ``expecting'' <span class="v">state</span> as described in the 
 documentation for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> and for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span>s in general.  If the 
 form returns a new <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> object as one of its values, then that is 
 considered the new ``current'' <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> for the evaluation of the 
 subsequent form.  See <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 provides some support for the functionality usually provided by global 
 variables in a read-eval-print loop, namely the saving of the result of a 
 computation for subsequent re-use in another expression.  See <a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> 
 and see <a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>If the form read is a single keyword, e.g., <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> or 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span>, then special procedures are followed.  See <a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-COMMANDS.html">keyword-commands</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> loop keeps track of the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s you have typed 
 and allows you to review them, display them, and roll the logical <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> 
 back to that created by any <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>.  See <a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 makes the convention that if a top-level form returns three values, 
 the last of which is an ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, then the first is treated as a flag 
 that means ``an error occurred,'' the second is the value to be printed if no 
 error occurred, and the third is (of course) the new <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.  When ``an 
 error occurs'' no value is printed.  Thus, if you execute a top-level form 
 that happens to return three such values, only the second will be printed (and 
 that will only happen if the first is <span class="v">nil</span>!).  See <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> for 
 details.</p>
