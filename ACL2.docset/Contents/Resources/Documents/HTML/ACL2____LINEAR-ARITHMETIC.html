<p>A description of the linear arithmetic decision procedure</p><p>ACL2 incorporates a rational linear arithmetic decision procedure. 
 When the ACL2 prover attempts to simplify a goal, it first constructs a data 
 structure, called the ``linear pot list'' (see <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>), that records 
 inequalities derived from the current goal, as an early step in the 
 simplification process.  The linear pot list is constructed as follows: first, 
 it is seeded with equalities and inequalities about arithmetic terms occurring 
 in the goal to be proved; then, it is extended by instantiating <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> lemmas about terms already in the pot list.  The resulting pot list is 
 then supplied to the decision procedure when the rewriter is trying to 
 establish or refute an arithmetic equality or inequality.  This happens, for 
 example, when an inequality occurs as a hypothesis of a rule being applied by 
 the rewriter.  (For discussion of the rewriter in general, see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-REWRITE-RULES-PART-1.html">introduction-to-rewrite-rules-part-1</a> and <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-REWRITE-RULES-PART-2.html">introduction-to-rewrite-rules-part-2</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p>We describe the procedure very roughly here.  Fundamental to the 
 procedure is the notion of a linear polynomial inequality.  A ``linear 
 polynomial'' is a sum of terms, each of which is the product of a rational 
 constant and an ``unknown.''  The ``unknown'' is permitted to be <span class="v">1</span> simply 
 to allow a term in the sum to be constant.  Thus, an example linear polynomial 
 is <span class="v">3*x + 7*a + 2</span>; here <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">a</span> are the (interesting) unknowns. 
 However, the unknowns need not be variable symbols.  For example, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a>
 x)</span> might be used as an unknown in a linear polynomial.  Thus, another linear 
 polynomial is <span class="v">3*(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> x) + 7*a</span>.  A ``linear polynomial inequality'' is 
 an inequality (either <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a></span>) relation between two linear 
 polynomials.  Note that an equality may be considered as a pair of 
 inequalities; e.q., <span class="v">3*x + 7*a + 2 = 0</span> is the same as the conjunction of 
 <span class="v">3*x + 7*a + 2 &lt;= 0</span> and <span class="v">0 &lt;= 3*x + 7*a + 2</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Certain linear polynomial inequalities can be combined by 
 cross-multiplication and addition to permit the deduction of a third 
 inequality with fewer unknowns.  If this deduced inequality is manifestly 
 false, a contradiction has been deduced from the assumed inequalities.</p> 
 
 <p>For example, suppose we have two assumptions</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">p1:       3*x + 7*a &lt;  4
p2:               3 &lt;  2*x</pre> 
 
 <p>and we wish to prove that, given <span class="v">p1</span> and <span class="v">p2</span>, <span class="v">a &lt; 0</span>.  As 
 suggested above, we proceed by assuming the negation of our goal</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">p3:               0 &lt;= a.</pre> 
 
 <p>and looking for a contradiction.</p> 
 
 <p>Our first step will be to eliminate the variable <span class="v">x</span>.  To that end, we 
 cross-multiply based on the coefficients of <span class="v">x</span> in the two inequalities. 
 By multiplying <span class="v">p1</span> by <span class="v">2</span> and <span class="v">p2</span> by <span class="v">3</span>, and then adding the 
 respective sides, we deduce the intermediate result</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">p4:  6*x + 14*a + 9 &lt; 8 + 6*x</pre> 
 
 <p>which, after cancellation, is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">p4:        14*a + 1 &lt;  0.</pre> 
 
 <p>If we then cross-multiply and add <span class="v">p3</span> to <span class="v">p4</span>, we get</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">p5:               1 &lt;= 0,</pre> 
 
 <p>a contradiction.  Thus, we have proved that <span class="v">p1</span> and <span class="v">p2</span> imply the 
 negation of <span class="v">p3</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>All of the unknowns of an inequality must be eliminated by cancellation in 
 order to produce a constant inequality.  We can choose to eliminate the 
 unknowns in any order, but we eliminate them in term-order, largest unknowns 
 first.  (See <a href="ACL2____TERM-ORDER.html">term-order</a>.)  That is, two polys are canceled against 
 each other only when they have the same largest unknown.  For instance, in the 
 above example we see that <span class="v">x</span> is the largest unknown in each of <span class="v">p1</span> and 
 <span class="v">p2</span>, and <span class="v">a</span> in <span class="v">p3</span> and <span class="v">p4</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Now suppose that this procedure does not produce a contradiction but 
 instead yields a set of nontrivial inequalities.  A contradiction might still 
 be deduced if we could add to the set some additional inequalities allowing 
 further cancellations.  That is where <span class="v">:linear</span> lemmas come in.  When the 
 set of inequalities has stabilized under cross-multiplication and addition and 
 no contradiction is produced, we search the database of <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> 
 rules for rules about the unknowns that are candidates for cancellation (i.e., 
 are the largest unknowns in their respective inequalities).  See <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> 
 for a description of how <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rules are used.</p>
