<p>Some subtle aspects of the counting done by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a></span></p><p>In this topic we cover the overcounting of ``useful'' <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> 
 application attempts, and we describe how ``useless'' rune application 
 attempts can actually be critical for a proof's success.  We conclude with a 
 few words about counting frames when there are nested (recursive) applications 
 of a rune.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Overcounting of ``useful'' rune application attempts.</i> Not every 
 <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> application may be necessary for a proof's success.  Consider for 
 example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> a (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> b x))))
            a))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then <span class="v">show-accumulated-persistence</span> will tell us that <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules <span class="v">car-cons</span> and <span class="v">cdr-cons</span> each had one useful 
 application.  However, the rule <span class="v">cdr-cons</span> is used to simplify <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> b x))</span> to <span class="v">x</span>, and this simplification is unnecessary for the proof. 
 Indeed, the proof succeeds even when preceded by the event: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a>
 (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> cdr-cons))</span>.  We thus see that a <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> application labeled as 
 ``useful'' may be simplifying a term that is not relevant to the proof.</p> 
 
 <p>As of this writing, we consider every <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> rule 
 application to be ``useful'', for simplicity of the implementation.  Moreover, 
 our counting of these rules is such that a single rule may be counted more 
 than once.</p> 
 
 <p><i>How ``useless'' attempts can be critical for a proof's success.</i> The 
 command <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> :useless</span>) will list rules that did not 
 contribute directly to the proof (see <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a>, in 
 particular the discussion of ``useless'' there).  However, a ``useless'' rule 
 can on rare occasions be critical to the success of a proof.  In the following 
 example, we have a ``bad'' rule that can take the proof in the wrong 
 direction, but a ``useless'' rule does a rewrite that prevents the successful 
 relieving of a hypothesis of the ``bad'' rule.  In summary:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; Assume p0.  We want to prove p1.

; Key rule:
p0 -&gt; p1 = t

; Bad rule that could ruin the proof:
p3 -&gt; p1 = p2

; But unfortunately, we know p3:
p0 -&gt; p3

; Important ``useless'' rule, preventing ``bad rule'' above from firing:
p3 = p4</pre> 
 
 <p>The following event captures the rules described above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 ((p0 (x) t)
  (p1 (x) t)
  (p2 (x) t)
  (p3 (x) t)
  (p4 (x) t))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> p0 (x) x))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> p1 (x) x))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> p2 (x) x))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> p3 (x) x))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> p4 (x) x))

; Key rule:
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> p0-implies-p1
   (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p0 x)
            (p1 x)))

; Bad rule that could ruin the proof:
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> p3-implies-p1-is-p2
   (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p3 x)
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (p1 x) (p2 x))))

; But unfortunately, we know p3:
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> p0-implies-p3
   (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p0 x)
            (p3 x)))

; Important ``useless'' rule, preventing p3-implies-p1-is-p2 from firing:
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> p3-is-p4
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (p3 x) (p4 x))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now we can see that <span class="v">p3-is-p4</span> is labeled as ``useless'', by evaluating 
 these commands.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> t)
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p0 x) (p1 x)))
(<a href="ACL2____SHOW-ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">show-accumulated-persistence</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>If instead we first evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> p3-is-p4))</span> before the 
 <span class="v">thm</span> above, then the proof fails, even though <span class="v">p3-is-p4</span> was labeled as 
 ``useless''!</p> 
 
 <p>Nevertheless, in general it is probably safe to disable rules reported as 
 ``useless'' by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SHOW-ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">show-accumulated-persistence</a> :useless)</span>, and doing so may 
 speed up a proof considerably.</p> 
 
 <p>Remark. The example above suggests a surprising fact: on rare occasions, a 
 proof may fail when you give an <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></span> hint consisting of 
 exactly the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s reported in a proof that succeeds.  For, imagine a 
 rule R that is needed in part of the proof but is ``bad'' in a second part, 
 and that some other, ``useless'' rule prevents the application of R in that 
 second part.  The example above suggests that disabling this ``useless'' rule 
 can allow the second application of R, thus preventing the proof.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally we discuss accumulation into frame counts in the case of a nested 
 (recursive) application of a rule: that is, the case that during the 
 application of a rule, the rule is applied again â€” in particular, while 
 relieving a hypothesis or rewriting the right-hand side from the original rule 
 application.  Recall that the implementation of <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> 
 keeps a stack of <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s currently being applied; thus, we are 
 considering here the case that a rune is pushed onto a stack on which it 
 already resides.  In that case, we count tries as usual but we avoid 
 accumulating until we reach the outermost (topmost) application of that rune. 
 
 Consider the following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> mem (a x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> x)
      nil
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> a (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)) (mem a (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now suppose we consider the theorem <span class="v">(mem a (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 1 2 3 a))</span>.  Each time 
 the definition of <span class="v">mem</span> is applied, a new stack frame is pushed.  We avoid 
 accumulating into the <span class="v">:frames</span> count for that stack frame unless it is the 
 topmost stack frame for that definition.  Otherwise the final <span class="v">:frames</span> 
 count would be the sum of the counts for those individual frames, which form a 
 linear sequence whose sum would therefore be quadratic in the number of 
 applications of the definition of <span class="v">mem</span>.</p>
