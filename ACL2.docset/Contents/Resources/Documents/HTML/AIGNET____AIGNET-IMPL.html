<p>Implementation details of Aignet's representation for execution. 
Since these details are hidden, most users can safely skip this section.</p><p>For background see <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> and <a href="AIGNET____REPRESENTATION.html">representation</a>.</p> 
 
<p>We now describe the actual implementation of the <span class="v">aignet</span> stobj for 
execution. Our use of <a href="ACL2____ABSTRACT-STOBJ.html">abstract-stobj</a>s means that these details are 
completely hidden from reasoning about <span class="v">aignet</span> and have nothing at all to 
do with the logical view of an <span class="v">aignet</span> as a list of logical nodes.  You 
should not need to know these details when writing new Aignet algorithms or 
when understanding existing Aignet code!</p> 
 
 
<h3>Node Array</h3> 
 
<p>The Aignet network consists mainly of an array of nodes representing a 
topologically sorted DAG.</p> 
 
<p>Each node in the graph has an ID, which is a natural number that can be used 
to look up that node in the array.  However, often our functions take arguments 
that may be a node or its negation; we encode this as a <a href="AIGNET____LITERAL.html">literal</a>, as 
2*ID+NEG, where NEG is 1 signifying negated or 0 signifying not negated.</p> 
 
<p>One arbitrary well-formedness condition that we impose on all Aignet 
networks is that it must have a unique constant-false node with index 0. 
Therefore, the literal 0 is constant-false (the constant-false node, not 
negated), and the literal 1 is constant-true (the constant-false node, 
negated).</p> 
 
<p>Information about each node is stored in the node array as two consecutive 
32-bit numbers, and the node ID corresponds to its position in the array.  That 
is, the two array indices of a node are 2*ID and 2*ID+1.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Node Encoding</h3> 
 
<p>The two 32-bit values contained at these locations are broken down into two 
30-bit data slots and four extra bits.  Three of the four extra bits encode the 
<b>type</b> of the node, and the last extra bit encodes the <b>phase</b> of the 
node, which is its value when all inputs/registers are 0.  The meaning of the 
30-bit data slots depends on the type of node; in some cases it stores a 
literal.</p> 
 
<p>The encoding is broken down, least-significant bits first, as follows:</p> 
 
<table class="xtable"> 
<tr>
<th>  Size  </th>
<th>   Contents             </th>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  2     </td>
<td>   Combinational type   </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  30    </td>
<td>   Data slot 0          </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  1     </td>
<td>   Register flag        </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  1     </td>
<td>   Phase                </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  30    </td>
<td>   Data slot 1          </td>
</tr> 
</table> 
 
<p>The combinational types are encoded as follows:</p> 
 
<table class="xtable"> 
<tr>
<th>  Encoding  </th>
<th>   Meaning          </th>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  0         </td>
<td>   Constant false   </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  1         </td>
<td>   And gate         </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  2         </td>
<td>   Input            </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>  3         </td>
<td>   Output           </td>
</tr> 
</table> 
 
<p>The register flag only applies to combinational inputs/outputs; it should be 
0 for constants/gates (but should also be ignored in those cases).  Note that 
the polarity here can be very <b>confusing</b>:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>An input with the register flag set is a register output,</li> 
<li>An output with the register flag set is a register input.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The reason for this is described in <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a>: the output of a register 
is an input to the combinational logic, and the input to a register is an 
output from the combinational logic.</p> 
 
<p>So there are, in total, six types of objects, encoded as follows:</p> 
 
<table class="xtable"> 
<tr>
<th>   Name             </th>
<th>  Combinational Type  </th>
<th>   Register Flag   </th>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>   Constant         </td>
<td>        0             </td>
<td>        -          </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>   And gate         </td>
<td>        1             </td>
<td>        -          </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>   Primary Input    </td>
<td>        2             </td>
<td>        0          </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>   Register Output  </td>
<td>        2             </td>
<td>        1          </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>   Primary Output   </td>
<td>        3             </td>
<td>        0          </td>
</tr> 
<tr>
<td>   Register Input   </td>
<td>        3             </td>
<td>        1          </td>
</tr> 
</table> 
 
 
<h3>Restrictions and Interpretation</h3> 
 
<p>Only objects with combinational types 0, 1, and 2—constants, gates, 
and combinational inputs—may be fanins (descendants) of AND or 
combinational output objects; combinational outputs (type 3) may not.</p> 
 
<p>The meanings of the two 30-bit data slots vary based on the type:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<b>Constants</b>.  Both data 0 slots are meaningless; they should be set to 
0 and ignored.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>AND gates</b>.  Data 0 and 1 are literals encoding the fanins to the 
gate.  To ensure an obvious topological ordering, the ID part of each literal 
must be less than the gate ID.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>Combinational inputs</b>.  Data 0 is ignored and should be 0.  Fanin 1 
gives the PI or register number, sequentially assigned and unique among 
PI/registers.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>Primary outputs</b>.  Data 0 is the fanin (literal) of the output, whose 
ID must (for topological ordering) be less than the output node ID.  Data 1 is 
the output number.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>Register inputs</b>.  Data 0 is the fanin (literal) of the register, 
whose ID must (for topological ordering) be less than this node's ID.  Fanin 1 
is the ID of the corresponding register output, which must also be less than 
this node's ID.  (The register number of the RI is the register number of the 
corresponding RO.)</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h3>Register Considerations</h3> 
 
<p>Having separate register input and output objects is somewhat awkward in 
terms of saying when a network is well-formed.  In some sense, it's not 
well-formed unless every RO has a corresponding RI.  But the RIs can't be added 
until their input cones are built, and we'd like to be able to say the network 
is well-formed in some sense while it is being built.  So while an RO has no 
corresponding RI, we will say it is simply not updated: its value under 
sequential evalutation remains the same at each frame.  A separate predicate 
can check that this isn't the case, but we won't generally require this for 
guards etc.</p> 
 
<p>Furthermore, for convenience, we also allow RIs with fanin 1 set to 0.  In 
this case they are not proper RIs because they do not connect to an RO, and 
they have no register number.  They are also basically irrelevant to any 
sequential computation, because no RI gets updated with their previous 
value.</p> 
 
<p>We require that each RI object occur later (have a larger ID) than its 
corresponding RO object.  This allows a couple of conveniences:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>There is a function for adding an RO and another function for adding an RI 
which connects it to an existing RO.  If we allowed RIs to occur first, then 
we'd need an additional pair of functions, for adding an unconnected RI and for 
adding an RO connected to an RI.  Maybe we could avoid this by separately 
allowing RO/RIs to be connected, but this seems knotty in terms of 
well-formedness.</li> 
 
<li>When doing a sequential simulation or similar operation that involves 
repeated sweeps across the AIG nodes, an RO node will be reached before the 
corresponding RI's previous value is overwritten.  So we don't need an 
addtional step of copying RI to RO values between frames.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Also, a strategy that might alleviate any inconvenience due to needing to 
add the RO before the RI: at the point of adding the RI, check whether the 
RO already exists and add it first if not.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Other Arrays</h3> 
 
<p>An Aignet network is designed to have objects added one at a time without 
later modification.  That is, new objects may be added, but existing objects 
are not changed.  The object array itself (along with its size) contains enough 
information to fully replicate the network; in this sense, all other 
information recorded is auxiliary.</p> 
 
<p>For efficient lookups, we do also keep arrays of inputs, outputs, and 
registers.</p> 
 
<p>The input and output arrays simply hold the IDs of inputs/outputs in the 
order that they were added (as described above, each input/output object 
records its input/output numbers, i.e. the index in the input/output array that 
points back to it).</p> 
 
<p>The register array is a bit more complicated, because there are typically 
two nodes (register input and register output) associated with each register. 
Each entry in the register array contains the ID of either a register input or 
output.  If it is a register input, then the register is incomplete, i.e. its 
output hasn't been added yet.  If it is a register output, then we have a 
complete register: the register array points to the register output node, which 
points to the register input node, which has the index in the register 
array.</p>
