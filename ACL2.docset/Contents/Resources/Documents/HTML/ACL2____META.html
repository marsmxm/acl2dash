<p>Make a <span class="v">:meta</span> rule (a hand-written simplifier)</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a general discussion of rule classes, 
 including how they are used to build rules from formulas and a discussion of 
 the various keywords in a rule class description.</p> 
 
 <p>Meta rules extend the ACL2 simplifier with hand-written code to transform 
 certain terms to equivalent ones.  To add a meta rule, the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> formula must establish that the hand-written ``metafunction'' 
 preserves the meaning of the transformed term.</p>

 <pre class="code">General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> x)        ; this hyp is optional

                (ev (fn x ...) a)))</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">equiv</span> is a known <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation, <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">a</span> 
 are distinct variable names, and <span class="v">ev</span> is an evaluator function (see below), 
 and <span class="v">fn</span> is a function symbol, as is <span class="v">hyp-fn</span> when provided.  The 
 arguments to <span class="v">fn</span> and <span class="v">hyp-fn</span> should be identical.  In the most common 
 case, both take a single argument, <span class="v">x</span>, which denotes the term to be 
 simplified.  If <span class="v">fn</span> and/or <span class="v">hyp-fn</span> are <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>ed, their <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s should be trivially implied by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span>.  We say the 
 theorem above is a ``metatheorem'' or ``metalemma'' and <span class="v">fn</span> is a 
 ``metafunction'', and <span class="v">hyp-fn</span> is a ``hypothesis metafunction''.</p> 
 
 <p>If ``<span class="v">...</span>'' is empty, i.e., the metafunctions take just one argument, 
 we say they are ``vanilla flavored.''  If ``<span class="v">...</span>'' is non-empty, we say 
 the metafunctions are ``extended.''  Extended metafunctions can access <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> and context sensitive information to compute their results, within 
 certain limits.  We discuss vanilla metafunctions here and recommend a 
 thorough understanding of them before proceeding (at which time see <a href="ACL2____EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>If a metafunction application to a term, <span class="v">u</span>, evaluates to a result of 
 the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> TEST NEW-TERM u)</span>, then <span class="v">TEST</span> is treated as an ``implicit 
 hypothesis''.  For discussion of this relatively advanced feature, see <a href="ACL2____META-IMPLICIT-HYPOTHESIS.html">meta-implicit-hypothesis</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Additional hypotheses are supported, called ``meta-extract hypotheses''. 
 These allow metafunctions to depend on the validity of certain terms extracted 
 from the context or the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  These hypotheses provide a 
 relatively advanced form of metatheorem so we explain them elsewhere; see 
 <a href="ACL2____META-EXTRACT.html">meta-extract</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>One might think that metafunctions and (if supplied) hypothesis 
 metafunctions must be executable: that is, not constrained (i.e., introduced 
 in the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>), and not <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>d <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NON-EXECUTABLE.html">non-executable</a></span>.  After all, there is no point in 
 installing a simplifier that cannot be run!  However, such a restriction is 
 not enforced, because one could introduce a metafunction using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> and then use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a></span> to attach it to an executable 
 function; see <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We defer discussion of the case in which there is a hypothesis metafunction 
 and for now address the case in which the other two hypotheses are 
 present.</p> 
 
 <p>In the discussion below, we refer to the argument, <span class="v">x</span>, of <span class="v">fn</span> and 
 <span class="v">hyp-fn</span> as a ``(translated) term,'' i.e., an object satisfying the ACL2 
 built-in predicate <span class="v">termp</span>.  When these metafunctions are executed by the 
 simplifier, they will be applied to (the quotations of) terms.  But during the 
 proof of the metatheorem itself, <span class="v">x</span> may not be the quotation of a term. 
 If the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> hypothesis is omitted, <span class="v">x</span> may be any object. 
 Even with the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> hypothesis, <span class="v">x</span> may merely ``look like a 
 term'' but use non-function symbols or function symbols of incorrect arity. 
 In any case, the metatheorem is stronger than necessary to allow us to apply 
 the metafunctions to terms, as we do in the discussion below.  We return later 
 to the question of proving the metatheorem.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose the general form of the metatheorem above is proved with the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a></span> hypotheses.  Then when the simplifier 
 encounters a term, <span class="v">(h t1 ... tn)</span>, that begins with a function symbol, 
 <span class="v">h</span>, listed in <span class="v">:trigger-fns</span>, it applies the metafunction, <span class="v">fn</span>, to 
 the quotation of the term, i.e., it evaluates <span class="v">(fn '(h t1 ... tn))</span> to 
 obtain some result, which can be written as <span class="v">'val</span>.  If <span class="v">'val</span> is 
 different from <span class="v">'(h t1 ... tn)</span> and <span class="v">val</span> is a well-formed term (see the 
 next paragraph), then <span class="v">(h t1 ... tn)</span> is replaced by <span class="v">val</span>, which is 
 then passed along for further rewriting.  Because the metatheorem establishes 
 the correctness of <span class="v">fn</span> for all terms (even non-terms!), there is no 
 restriction on which function symbols are listed in the <span class="v">:trigger-fns</span>. 
 Generally, of course, they should be the symbols that head up the terms 
 simplified by the metafunction <span class="v">fn</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the result of applying a metafunction (or a hypothesis 
 metafunction) must be a term, i.e., must satisfy the predicate <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a></span> 
 in the current logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  If not, then an error occurs.  See <a href="ACL2____TERM-TABLE.html">term-table</a> for how one obtains some assistance towards testing that <span class="v">val</span> 
 is indeed a term.  ACL2 actually enforces a stronger requirement, disallowing 
 calls of certain ``forbidden'' function symbols as described in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-SKIP-META-TERMP-CHECKS.html">set-skip-meta-termp-checks</a></span>.  Both of these runtime checks can be avoided by 
 proving that the metafunction (and the corresponding hypothesis metafunction, 
 if any) always produces an acceptable term.  See <a href="ACL2____WELL-FORMEDNESS-GUARANTEE.html">well-formedness-guarantee</a>.  Alternatively, with an active trust tag (see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>) you can tell ACL2 to skip these tests; see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-SKIP-META-TERMP-CHECKS.html">set-skip-meta-termp-checks</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The ``evaluator'' function, <span class="v">ev</span>, is a function that can evaluate a 
 certain class of expressions, namely, all of those composed of variables, 
 constants, and applications of a fixed, finite set of function symbols, 
 <span class="v">g1</span>, ..., <span class="v">gk</span>.  Generally speaking, the set of function symbols 
 handled by <span class="v">ev</span> is chosen to be exactly the function symbols recognized and 
 manipulated by the metafunctions being introduced.  For example, if <span class="v">fn</span> 
 manipulates expressions in which <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> and <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></span> occur as function symbols, then <span class="v">ev</span> is generally specified 
 to handle <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></span>.  The actual requirements on 
 <span class="v">ev</span> become clear when the metatheorem is proved.  The standard way to 
 introduce an evaluator is to use the ACL2 macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a></span>, though 
 this is not strictly necessary.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a> if you want 
 details.</p> 
 
 <p>[Aside for the logic-minded.] Why are we justified in using metafunctions 
 this way?  Suppose <span class="v">(fn 'term1)</span> is <span class="v">'term2</span>.  What justifies replacing 
 <span class="v">term1</span> by <span class="v">term2</span>?  The first step is to assert that <span class="v">term1</span> is 
 <span class="v">(ev 'term1 a)</span>, where <span class="v">a</span> is an alist that maps <span class="v">'var</span> to <span class="v">var</span>, 
 for each variable <span class="v">var</span> in <span class="v">term1</span>.  This step is incorrect, because 
 <span class="v">'term1</span> may contain function symbols other than the ones, <span class="v">g1</span>, ..., 
 <span class="v">gk</span>, that <span class="v">ev</span> knows how to handle.  But we can grow <span class="v">ev</span> to a 
 ``larger'' evaluator, <span class="v">ev*</span>, an evaluator for all of the symbols that occur 
 in <span class="v">term1</span> or <span class="v">term2</span>.  We can prove that <span class="v">ev*</span> satisfies the <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s on <span class="v">ev</span>, provided no <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> events are adding 
 constraints to <span class="v">ev</span> (or callers of <span class="v">ev</span>, and recursively); ACL2 checks 
 this additional property.  Hence, the metatheorem holds for <span class="v">ev*</span> in place 
 of <span class="v">ev</span>, by functional instantiation.  We can then carry out the proof of 
 the <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> of <span class="v">term1</span> and <span class="v">term2</span> as follows: Fix <span class="v">a</span> to 
 be an alist that maps the quotations of the variables of <span class="v">term1</span> and 
 <span class="v">term2</span> to themselves.  Then,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">term1 = (ev* 'term1 a)      ; (1) by construction of ev* and a
      = (ev* (fn 'term1) a) ; (2) by the metatheorem for ev*
      = (ev* 'term2 a)      ; (3) by evaluation of fn
      = term2               ; (4) by construction of ev* and a</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that in line (2) above, where we appeal to the (functional 
 instantiation of the) metatheorem, we can relieve its (optional) <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a></span> hypotheses by appealing to the facts that 
 <span class="v">term1</span> is a term and <span class="v">a</span> is an alist by construction.  [End of Aside 
 for the logic-minded.]</p> 
 
 <p>There are subtleties related to the notion of ``growing'' <span class="v">ev</span> to a 
 ``larger'' evaluator, as mentioned in the paragraph just above.  For 
 corresponding restrictions on <span class="v">:meta</span> rules, see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATOR-RESTRICTIONS.html">evaluator-restrictions</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we turn to the second case, in which there is a hypothesis 
 metafunction.  In that case, consider as before what happens when the 
 simplifier encounters a term, <span class="v">(h t1 ... tn)</span>, where <span class="v">h</span> is listed in 
 <span class="v">:trigger-fns</span>.  This time, after it applies <span class="v">fn</span> to <span class="v">'(h t1 ... tn)</span> 
 to obtain the quotation of some new term, <span class="v">'val</span>, it then applies the 
 hypothesis metafunction, <span class="v">hyp-fn</span>.  That is, it evaluates <span class="v">(hyp-fn '(h t1
 ... tn))</span> to obtain some result, which can be written as <span class="v">'hyp-val</span>.  If 
 <span class="v">hyp-val</span> is not in fact a term, the metafunction is not used.  Provided 
 <span class="v">hyp-val</span> is a term, the simplifier attempts to establish (by conventional 
 backchaining) that this term is non-<span class="v">nil</span> in the current context.  Note 
 that this backchaining is done just as it is done for hypotheses of <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> (and <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>) rules, namely, by rewriting with special 
 attention to calls of certain functions including <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></span>.  If this attempt to 
 establish this term fails, then the meta rule is not applied.  Otherwise, 
 <span class="v">(h t1...tn)</span> is replaced by <span class="v">val</span> as in the previous case (where there 
 was no hypothesis metafunction).</p> 
 
 <p>Why is it justified to make this extension to the case of hypothesis 
 metafunctions?  First, note that the rule</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> x)
              (<a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a> a)
              (ev (hyp-fn x) a))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (ev x a)
                (ev (fn x) a)))</pre> 
 
 <p>is logically equivalent to the rule</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> x)
              (<a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a> a))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (ev x a)
                (ev (new-fn x) a)))</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">(new-fn x)</span> is defined to be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'if (hyp-fn x) (fn x) x)</span>. 
 (If we're careful, we realize that this argument depends on making an 
 extension of <span class="v">ev</span> to an evaluator <span class="v">ev*</span> that handles <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> and the 
 functions manipulated by <span class="v">hyp-fn</span>.)  If we write <span class="v">'term</span> for the 
 quotation of the present term, and if <span class="v">(hyp-fn 'term)</span> and <span class="v">(fn 'term)</span> 
 are both terms, say <span class="v">hyp1</span> and <span class="v">term1</span>, then by the previous argument we 
 know it is sound to rewrite term to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> hyp1 term1 term)</span>.  But since we 
 have established in the current context that <span class="v">hyp1</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>, we may 
 simplify <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> hyp1 term1 term)</span> to <span class="v">term1</span>, as desired.</p> 
 
 <p>We now discuss the role of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> hypothesis. 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">Pseudo-termp</a> x)</span> checks that <span class="v">x</span> has the shape of a term.  Roughly 
 speaking, it ensures that <span class="v">x</span> is a symbol, a quoted constant, or a true 
 list consisting of a <span class="v">lambda</span> expression or symbol followed by some 
 pseudo-terms.  Among the properties of terms not checked by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> are that variable symbols never begin with ampersand, 
 <span class="v">lambda</span> expressions are closed, and function symbols are applied to the 
 correct number of arguments.  See <a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>There are two possible roles for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> in the development of 
 a metatheorem: it may be used as the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of the metafunction and/or 
 hypothesis metafunction and it may be used as a hypothesis of the metatheorem. 
 Generally speaking, the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> hypothesis is included in a 
 metatheorem only if it makes it easier to prove.  The choice is yours.  (An 
 extreme example of this is when the metatheorem is invalid without the 
 hypothesis!)  We therefore address ourselves the question: should a 
 metafunction have a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>?  A <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> for a metafunction, in connection with other considerations 
 described below, improves the efficiency with which the metafunction is used 
 by the simplifier.</p> 
 
 <p>To make a metafunction maximally efficient you should (a) provide it with a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> and exploit the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> when possible 
 in coding the body of the function (see <a href="ACL2____GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>, 
 especially the section on efficiency issues), (b) verify the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of 
 the metafunction (see <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>), and (c) compile the metafunction 
 (see <a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a>).  When these three steps have been taken the simplifier can 
 evaluate <span class="v">(fn 'term1)</span> by running the compiled ``primary code'' (see <a href="ACL2____GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>) for <span class="v">fn</span> directly in Common Lisp.  (Note however 
 that explicit compilation may be suppressed; see <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p>Before discussing efficiency issues further, let us review for a moment the 
 general case in which we wish to evaluate <span class="v">(fn 'obj)</span> for some <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> function.  We must first ask whether the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of <span class="v">fn</span> have 
 been verified.  If not, we must evaluate <span class="v">fn</span> by executing its logic 
 definition.  This effectively checks the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of every subroutine and 
 so can be slow.  If, on the other hand, the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of <span class="v">fn</span> have been 
 verified, then we can run the primary code for <span class="v">fn</span>, provided <span class="v">'obj</span> 
 satisfies the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of <span class="v">fn</span>.  So we must next evaluate the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of <span class="v">fn</span> on <span class="v">'obj</span>.  If the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> is met, then we run the 
 primary code for <span class="v">fn</span>, otherwise we run the logic code.</p> 
 
 <p>Now in the case of a metafunction for which the three steps above have been 
 followed, we know the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> is (implied by) <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> and 
 that it has been verified.  Furthermore, we know without checking that the 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> is met (because <span class="v">term1</span> is a term and hence <span class="v">'term1</span> is a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span>).  Hence, we can use the compiled primary code 
 directly.</p> 
 
 <p>We strongly recommend that you compile your metafunctions, as well as all 
 their subroutines (unless explicit compilation is suppressed; see <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a>).  Guard verification is also recommended.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we present a very simple example of the use of <span class="v">:meta</span> rules, 
 based on one provided by Robert Krug.  This example illustrates a trick for 
 avoiding undesired rewriting after applying a metafunction or any other form 
 of rewriting.  To elaborate: in general, the term <span class="v">t2</span> obtained by applying 
 a metafunction to a term <span class="v">t1</span> is then handed immediately to the rewriter, 
 which descends recursively through the arguments of function calls to rewrite 
 <span class="v">t2</span> completely.  But if <span class="v">t2</span> shares a lot of structure with <span class="v">t1</span>, 
 then it might not be worthwhile to rewrite <span class="v">t2</span> immediately.  (A rewrite of 
 <span class="v">t2</span> will occur anyhow the next time a goal is generated.)  The trick 
 involves avoiding this rewrite by wrapping <span class="v">t2</span> inside a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a></span>, which in turn is inside a call of a user-defined ``unhiding'' function, 
 <span class="v">unhide</span>.</p>

 <p>Notice that in the following (silly) conjecture, ACL2 initially does only 
 does the simplification directed by the metafunction; a second goal is 
 generated before the commutativity of addition can be applied.  If the above 
 calls of <span class="v">UNHIDE</span> and <span class="v">HIDE</span> had been stripped off, then <span class="v">Goal'</span> 
 would have been the term printed in <span class="v">Goal''</span> below.</p>

        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (my-plus b a)

This simplifies, using the :meta rule MY-META-LEMMA and the :rewrite
rule UNHIDE-HIDE, to

Goal'
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> B A) CCC).

This simplifies, using the :rewrite rule COMMUTATIVITY-OF-+, to

Goal''

 <p>The discussion above probably suffices to make good use of this <span class="v">(UNHIDE
 (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">HIDE</a> ...))</span> trick.  However, we invite the reader who wishes to understand 
 the trick in depth to evaluate the following form before submitting the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span> form above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a> (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> :entry (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="ACL2____TAKE.html">take</a> 2 arglist))

        (rewrite-with-lemma :entry (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="ACL2____TAKE.html">take</a> 2 arglist))
                            :exit (<a href="ACL2____TAKE.html">take</a> 2 values)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The following annotated subset of the trace output (which may appear a bit 
 different depending on the underlying Common Lisp implementation) explains how 
 the trick works.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">    2&gt; (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">REWRITE</a> ((MY-PLUS B A) NIL))&gt;
      3&gt; (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA
              ((MY-PLUS B A)
               (REWRITE-RULE (:META MY-META-LEMMA)
                             1822
                             NIL EQUAL META-FN NIL META NIL NIL)))&gt;

We apply the meta rule, then recursively rewrite the result, which is the
(UNHIDE (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">HIDE</a> ...)) term shown just below.

        4&gt; (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">REWRITE</a> ((UNHIDE (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">HIDE</a> (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A)))
                     ((A . A) (B . B))))&gt;
          5&gt; (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">REWRITE</a> ((<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">HIDE</a> (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A))
                       ((A . A) (B . B))))&gt;

The HIDE protects its argument from being touched by the rewriter.

          &lt;5 (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">REWRITE</a> (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">HIDE</a> (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A)))&gt;
          5&gt; (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA
                  ((UNHIDE (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">HIDE</a> (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A)))
                   (REWRITE-RULE (:REWRITE UNHIDE-HIDE)
                                 1806 NIL EQUAL (UNHIDE (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">HIDE</a> X))
                                 X ABBREVIATION NIL NIL)))&gt;

Now we apply UNHIDE-HIDE, then recursively rewrite its right-hand
side in an environment where X is bound to (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A).

            6&gt; (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">REWRITE</a> (X ((X BINARY-+ B A))))&gt;

Notice that at this point X is cached, so REWRITE just returns
(<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A).

            &lt;6 (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">REWRITE</a> (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A))&gt;
          &lt;5 (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA T (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A))&gt;
        &lt;4 (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">REWRITE</a> (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A))&gt;
      &lt;3 (REWRITE-WITH-LEMMA T (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A))&gt;
    &lt;2 (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">REWRITE</a> (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> B A))&gt;</pre>
