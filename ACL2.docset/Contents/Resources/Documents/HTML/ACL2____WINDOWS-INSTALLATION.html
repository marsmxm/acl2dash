<p>Installing ACL2 on Windows</p><p>Windows users will probably want to do one of the following to 
 install and run ACL2 on their systems.  Thanks to David Rager for his help 
 with this topic.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Fetch the ACL2 Sedan (ACL2s) — see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-SEDAN.html">ACL2-sedan</a> — which 
 is an extension and distribution of ACL2 integrated with the Eclipse IDE.  If 
 you wish to use ACL2s without the Eclipse front-end, see <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/HTML/installation/obtaining-and-installing.html#Shortcut-acl2s" target="_blank"><nobr>the 
 information about ACL2s in the installation instructions<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/current/HTML/installation/obtaining-and-installing.html#Shortcut-acl2s"></nobr></a>, which explains 
 how to obtain and use a pre-built ACL2 binary for Windows, Linux, or Mac.</li> 
 
 <li>Use a Virtual Machine platform, such as VMware Player (free for 
 non-commercial use) or Oracle Virtualbox (free even for commercial 
 use) to install Linux, and then follow the normal installation 
 instructions to install ACL2.  As of 2014, at least a couple of our 
 power users are very happy with this solution, as it provides 
 first-class access to utilities relevant to maintaining the ACL2 
 system and books (like GNU Make and perl).</li> 
 
 <li>Set up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux" target="_blank"><nobr>Windows 
 Subsystem for Linux<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux"></nobr></a> on a 64-bit version of Windows 10 (or later, once 
 available).  Within that subsystem, follow the setup and installation 
 instructions for ACL2.  (You might be the first to test this, but it will 
 likely work.)</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>You are welcome to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-6/distrib/windows/" target="_blank"><nobr>obtain 
 a Windows installer for a previous ACL2 release<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v3-6/distrib/windows/"></nobr></a>, which mimics some of 
 Linux and provides Emacs.  Updated ACL2 binaries have been successfully 
 installed in such an environment.</p>
