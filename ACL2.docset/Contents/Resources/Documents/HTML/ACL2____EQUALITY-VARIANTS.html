<p>Versions of a function using different equality tests</p><p>The ACL2 environment includes not only a logic but also a 
 programming language, which is based on Common Lisp.  Execution efficiency may 
 be increased by using fast equality tests: <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span> for symbols and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span> for numbers, symbols, and characters (see <a href="ACL2____EQLABLEP.html">eqlablep</a>).  Several 
 list-processing functions built into ACL2 thus have three variants, depending 
 on whether the equality function used is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>; a list is provided below.  ACL2 has taken measures to ensure that one 
 can reason about a single logical function even when one uses these different 
 variants.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider for example the case of list membership.  Common Lisp provides a 
 utility for this purposes, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a></span>, which can take a <span class="v">:TEST</span> keyword 
 argument, default <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span>.  So for example, one might write</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> a x :TEST 'eq)</pre> 
 
 <p>if either <span class="v">a</span> is a symbol or <span class="v">x</span> is a list of symbols, so that the 
 fastest equality test (<span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>) may be used when comparing <span class="v">a</span> to 
 successive elements of the list, <span class="v">x</span>.  One might elsewhere write <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a>
 b (foo y))</span>, which is equivalent to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> b (foo y) :TEST 'eql)</span>, for 
 example if <span class="v">b</span> is a number.  If one wants to reason about both <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> a
 x :TEST 'eq)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> b y)</span>, it might be helpful for both calls of 
 <span class="v">member</span> to be the same logically, even though Common Lisp will execute 
 them differently (using <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span>, respectively).  ACL2 
 arranges that in fact, both references to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a></span> generate calls of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a></span> in the theorem prover.</p> 
 
 <p>In fact, since <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a></span> can take the optional <span class="v">:TEST</span> keyword 
 argument, then in ACL2 it must be defined as a macro, not a function (see 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a>).  ACL2 arranges that a call of <span class="v">member</span> generates a 
 corresponding call of the function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a></span>, regardless of the 
 value of <span class="v">TEST</span>, in a manner that produces <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a></span> in prover 
 output.  More generally, you can expect ACL2 to treat your use of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a></span> as though you had written <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a></span>, for example in the way 
 it stores <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules and other kinds of rules as well (see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>).  We say little here about how this is all arranged by ACL2, 
 other than to mention that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> is utilized (so, you might see mention 
 in proof logs) of the function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> that implements <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span>.  Such details, which involve a notion of ``macro alias'' and probably 
 can be ignored by most users, may be found elsewhere; see <a href="ACL2____EQUALITY-VARIANTS-DETAILS.html">equality-variants-details</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>As a convenience to the user, the macro <span class="v">member-eq</span> is provided that 
 expands to a corresponding call of <span class="v">member</span> with <span class="v">:TEST 'eq</span>, as 
 follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:trans1 (<a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQ.html">member-eq</a> (foo x) (bar y))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> (FOO X) (BAR Y) :TEST 'EQ)
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>For efficiency we recommend using the <span class="v">-equal</span> equality variant, for 
 example <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a></span> or <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a></span><span class="v"> ... :TEST 'equal)</span>, 
 in certain contexts: <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span>, and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a></span> forms.  However, the implementation of equality variants 
 has been designed so that when defining a function, one may choose freely in a 
 definition an equality variant of primitive <span class="v">F</span>, to get efficient execution 
 but where subsequent reasoning is about <span class="v">F-equal</span>.  For details about the 
 above recommendation and for a discussion of the implementation, see <a href="ACL2____EQUALITY-VARIANTS-DETAILS.html">equality-variants-details</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The following alphabetical list includes all primitives that have equality 
 variants.  Each macro <span class="v">F</span> listed below takes an optional <span class="v">:TEST</span> keyword 
 argument of <span class="v">'eq</span>, <span class="v">'eql</span>, or <span class="v">'equal</span>, where <span class="v">'eql</span> is the 
 default.  For each such <span class="v">F</span>, a function <span class="v">F-equal</span> is defined such that 
 for logical purposes (in particular theorem proving), each call of <span class="v">F</span> 
 expands to a corresponding call of <span class="v">F-equal</span>.  For convenience, a macro 
 <span class="v">F-eq</span> is also defined, so that a call of <span class="v">F-eq</span> expands to a 
 corresponding call of <span class="v">F</span> with <span class="v">:TEST 'eq</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-TO-SET.html">add-to-set</a></span> 
<span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ASSOC.html">assoc</a></span> 
<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERSECTION_42.html">intersection$</a></span> ; (see Note below)

<span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SUBSETP.html">subsetp</a></span> 
<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNION_42.html">union$</a></span> ; (see Note below) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Note: Three of the macros above have names ending with the character, 
 `<span class="v">$</span>': <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERSECTION_42.html">intersection$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-DIFFERENCE_42.html">set-difference$</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNION_42.html">union$</a></span>. 
 In each case there is a corresponding Common Lisp primitive without the 
 trailing `<span class="v">$</span>': <span class="v">intersection</span>, <span class="v">set-difference</span>, and <span class="v">union</span>. 
 However, Common Lisp does not specify the order of elements in the list 
 returned by those primitives, so ACL2 has its own.  Nevertheless, the only use 
 of the trailing `<span class="v">$</span>' is to distinguish the primitives; associated 
 functions and macros, for example <span class="v">union-eq</span> and <span class="v">intersection-equal</span>, 
 do not include the `<span class="v">$</span>' character in their names.</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude with a brief discussion of <a href="ACL2____GUARDS.html">guards</a>.  The expansion of any 
 of the above macros depends on the keyword argument, which generates a 
 function call with a guard suitable for the equality test being used. 
 Consider for example the call <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> x lst :test 'eq)</span>, or equivalently, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQ.html">member-eq</a> x lst)</span>.  Expanding these macros leads to a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span>; you can see how that goes by using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS1.html">trans1</a></span>.  Ultimately, 
 the guard being checked is that of the function <span class="v">member-eq-exec</span>, which is 
 as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> x)
    (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> lst)
  (<a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-LISTP.html">symbol-listp</a> lst))</pre> 
 
 <p>Care has been taken to ensure that this guard is checked during evaluation 
 and also that it generates suitable proof obligations for guard verification 
 (see <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>).  A guard violation might look something like 
 this:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQ.html">member-eq</a> 3 '(4 5))


ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function call
(MEMBER-EQ-EXEC$GUARD-CHECK X LST), which is
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">IF</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">SYMBOLP</a> X) (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">TRUE-LISTP</a> LST) (<a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-LISTP.html">SYMBOL-LISTP</a> LST)), is violated by
the arguments in the call (MEMBER-EQ-EXEC$GUARD-CHECK 3 '(4 5)).
See :DOC set-guard-checking for information about suppressing this
check with (<a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> :none), as recommended for new users.
To debug see :DOC print-gv, see :DOC trace, and see :DOC wet.

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Above, <span class="v">member-eq-exec$guard-check</span> is a function generated as part of 
 ACL2's expansion of <span class="v">member</span> with <span class="v">:test 'eq</span>, and this function symbol 
 can be quite reasonably ignored.  The important thing is that it refers to the 
 guard for <span class="v">member-eq-exec</span>, which as the name may suggest is intended to 
 guard the execution of a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQ.html">member-eq</a></span>, or a call of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a></span> with <span class="v">:test 'eq</span>.  The important part of the message above is the 
 guard actually being violated: <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">IF</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">SYMBOLP</a> X) (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">TRUE-LISTP</a>
 LST) (<a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-LISTP.html">SYMBOL-LISTP</a> LST))</span>.</p>
