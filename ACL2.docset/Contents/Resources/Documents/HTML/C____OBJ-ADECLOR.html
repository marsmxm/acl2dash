<p>These are abstract declarators for objects. 
     [C] does not have a separate syntactic category for them, 
     but in our abstract syntax it is useful 
     to differentiate them from other kinds of abstract declarators.</p><p>For now we only capture three kinds of abstract object declarators, 
     corresponding to the (non-abstract) object declarators 
     captured in <span class="tt"><a href="C____OBJ-DECLOR.html">obj-declor</a></span>: 
     an abstract declarator is like a declarator without the identifier. 
     Abstract declarators are used in type names, 
     which are like declarations without identifiers [C:6.7.7/2].</p><p>From a point of view, 
     it may seem strange to have an explicit value, in this fixtype, 
     for no abstract object declarator, 
     since the fixtype should consist of abstract object declarators. 
     However, this modeling choice is justified by 
     the correspondence between abstract declarators and declarators 
     explained just above.</p>
