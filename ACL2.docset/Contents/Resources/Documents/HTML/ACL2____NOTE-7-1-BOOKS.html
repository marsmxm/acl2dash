 Wiki page on Release Version Numbers<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/wiki/Release-version-numbers"></nobr></a> gives the Git/SVN revision numbers 
 corresponding to releases.  See also <a href="ACL2____NOTE-7-1.html">note-7-1</a> for the changes made to 
 ACL2 itself.  For additional details, you may also see the raw <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master" target="_blank"><nobr>commit log<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Deleted Books and Stubs</h3> 
 
 <p>When we move a book, we often add a <b>stub</b> book in its previous 
 location to help you transition your <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> commands.  The <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> build system prints warnings when a stub book is being 
 included.  Stub books have a lifespan of one release.  The following books 
 were stubs in ACL2 7.0, so we've deleted them.</p>

 <p>The directory <span class="v">fix-cert/</span> has been deleted, as it is no longer necessary 
 now that it is possible to move the system books directory after certifying 
 its books (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-7-1.html">note-7-1</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>The directory <span class="v">regex/</span> has been moved to <span class="v">projects/regex/</span>.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>New Libraries and Documentation</h3> 
 
 <p>David Russinoff has contributed a new version of the rtl library: 
 <span class="v">rtl/rel10/</span>.  This time the new version depends on a previous version, 
 namely, <span class="v">rtl/rel9/</span>.  The new <span class="v">rtl/rel10/</span> library has, in turn, been 
 adapted to reside in a new <span class="v">"RTL"</span> package; the result is 
 <span class="v">rtl/rel11/</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Marijn Heule's <span class="v">drat-trim</span> tool, for checking SAT solver proofs, is now 
 available in <span class="v">tools/drat-trim</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Matt Kaufmann and Cuong Chau have formalized the overspill property in 
 ACL2(r), see <span class="v">nonstd/nsa/overspill.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The new <span class="v">clause-processors/induction</span> book demonstrates a (not very 
 practical) clause processor that does induction.</p> 
 
 <p>The new directory <span class="v">projects/fifo</span> has a list-based FIFO implementation, 
 that has some properties proven about it.</p> 
 
 <p>The new book <span class="v">books/tools/include-an-arithmetic-book.lisp</span> 
 provides short-hand includes of the arithmetic libraries, including 
 various configurations of <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">misc/assert</span> book is now documented; see for instance <a href="ACL2____ASSERT_12.html">assert!</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The documentation for <a href="ACL2____DATA-STRUCTURES.html">data-structures</a> is now included in the manual; 
 previously it was excluded because of name conflicts with other libraries, but 
 these have now been resolved.</p> 
 
 <h3>Name Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>As mentioned above, the newest <a href="ACL2____RTL.html">rtl</a> library is now in an <span class="v">RTL</span> 
 package.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____BITOPS.html">bitops</a> library is now in a new <span class="v">BITOPS</span> package.  See below 
 (under ``bitops'') for more information and suggestions about porting books.</p> 
 
 <p>Renamed <span class="v">remove-keywords</span> to <span class="v">remove-any-keywords</span> in 
 <span class="v">coi/nary/nary.lisp</span> to avoid a name conflict between the <span class="v">coi</span> and 
 <span class="v">ccg</span> books; also updated the <span class="v">nary</span> workshop books.</p> 
 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____STD.html">std</a></h3> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> book has moved from <span class="v">tools/bstar</span> to <span class="v">std/util/bstar</span>. 
 There is a stub in the previous location.  As a special compatibility measure, 
 this stub will be kept available for two releases.</p> 
 
 <p>Added new <a href="ACL2____PRINT-LEGIBLY.html">print-legibly</a> and <a href="ACL2____PRINT-COMPRESSED.html">print-compressed</a> functions to 
 <a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">std/io</a>.  These can print to <span class="v">:object</span> channels with or without <a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE.html">serialize</a>-style compression, and have the necessary theorems about state and 
 output-channel preservation.</p> 
 
 <p>There is new syntactic sugar based on <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a>'s named return values. 
 The new <a href="ACL2____DEFRET.html">defret</a> macro offers a more comfortable syntax for proving 
 theorems about return values by their name.  Also, the new <a href="ACL2____PATBIND-RET.html">ret</a> binder for <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> allows you to name the bundled 
 return values from a <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> and then access individual components using 
 a C-like or <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">std::defaggregate</a>/<a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>-like <span class="v">.</span> syntax.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> macro now checks the arity of <span class="v">:returns</span> specifiers 
 when possible.</p> 
 
 <p>Some <span class="v">std/lists</span> books have been tweaked:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a> book now provides stronger rules.</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">equal-sets</span> book now includes the lemma 
 <span class="v">set-equiv-of-nil</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">append</span> book now includes a few rules about (ca/dr (append ...)) 
 to std/lists.  (Two of the new rules are disabled, and there's a theory 
 invariant to make sure things stay reasonable.)</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">duplicity</span> book now have stronger theorems relating <a href="ACL2____DUPLICITY.html">duplicity</a> to <a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____OSLIB.html">oslib</a></h3> 
 
 <p>Added a new <a href="OSLIB____UNIVERSAL-TIME.html">oslib::universal-time</a> function.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a raw lisp bug with the definition of @9see oslib::ls), and added a 
 regression test.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed minor bugs with <a href="OSLIB____COPY.html">oslib::copy</a>.</p> 
 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____BITOPS.html">bitops</a></h3> 
 
 <p>Bitops is now in a package.  To minimize backwards incompatibility, the new 
 package imports a lot of stuff that you might not expect.  For instance all of 
 the <a href="ACL2____LOGOPS-DEFINITIONS.html">logops-definitions</a>, and their recursive <span class="v">**</span> variants are still 
 found in the ACL2 package, as are most of the bitops rulesets, its new 
 function definitions, and many frequently instantiated theorems.  When 
 updating your books, you may find it convenient to import 
 <span class="v">*bitops-exports*</span> into packages that use bitops functions.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the <a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2MERGE.html">bitops::bitops/merge</a> book with several new 256- and 
 512-bit merges, <a href="ACL2____MERGE-8-U2S.html">merge-8-u2s</a>, and improved its 
 documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <a href="ACL2____NTH-SLICE128.html">nth-slice128</a>.</p> 
 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a></h3> 
 
 <p>The case macros from <a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">fty::defflexsum</a> and <a href="FTY____DEFTRANSSUM.html">fty::deftranssum</a> now 
 require a variable, and cannot bind that variable itself, because the syntax 
 for doing so was too weird and unintuitive.  They can now also be used to 
 carry out type-checks, e.g., <span class="v">(foo-case x :mytag)</span> now returns true when 
 <span class="v">x</span> has tag <span class="v">:mytag</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The macros <span class="v">defoption</span> and <span class="v">deftranssum</span> macros, formerly part of 
 <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a>, are now integrated into the <a href="FTY____DEFTYPES.html">fty::deftypes</a> framework.</p> 
 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a></h3> 
 
 <p>The fancy viewer's jump-to box should perform better.  It now suggest exact 
 name matches first and otherwise shows results in importance order, instead of 
 alphabetical order, which may be better when there are many matches.</p> 
 
 <p>The fancy viewer now features a mobile-friendly version with many features. 
 This should greatly improve access to ACL2 documentation at parties, sporting 
 events, and other social occasions.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug with <span class="v">&lt;em&gt;</span> tag handling that affected the <span class="v">:xdoc</span> 
 command and Emacs-based <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> tool.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug with using multiple <a href="ACL2____DEFSECTION.html">defsection</a> extensions with the same 
 name.  Defsection now requires a non-nil symbol as the section name.</p> 
 
 <p>As the manual has grown substantially, some memory management measures have 
 been taken in <span class="v">doc/top.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 
 <h3><a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">quicklisp</a></h3> 
 
 <p>The approach to distributing Common Lisp libraries has been updated to use 
 the new <a href="http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/bundles.html" target="_blank"><nobr>Quicklisp 
 bundles<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/bundles.html"></nobr></a> feature.  Some additional Common Lisp libraries have been 
 added to the bundle.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____TSHELL.html">tshell</a> library is now based on the <a href="https://github.com/jaredcdavis/shellpool" target="_blank"><nobr>Shellpool<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/jaredcdavis/shellpool"></nobr></a> Common Lisp 
 library (via <a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">quicklisp</a>).  This may improve reliability and cross-lisp 
 portability for <span class="v">tshell</span> itself and also for libraries like <a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a> 
 which are based on it.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>
<a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a>, <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>, and now <a href="ACL2____VL2014.html">vl2014</a>
</h3> 
 
 <p>VL and ESIM have undergone major changes, including a fork of VL.  For 
 details about these changes, see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-7-1-VL.html">note-7-1-vl</a>.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Other Libraries</h3> 
 
 <p>Ben Selfridge's <a href="ACL2____LEFTIST-TREES.html">leftist-trees</a> library is now available under an 
 MIT/X11 style license instead of the GNU General Public License.</p> 
 
 <p>The bounding theorems for <a href="ACL2____LOGEXT.html">logext</a> in <span class="v">ihs/logops-definitions</span> have 
 been tightened.</p> 
 
 <p>For the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>, there is now a <a href="ACL2____UNARY--.html">unary--</a> bounder in 
 <span class="v">tau/bounders/elementary-bounders</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFSORT.html">defsort</a> macro has been enhanced to better support the fixtype 
 discipline of the <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a> library.  In support of this, it now 
 requires a stricter transitivity property, i.e., the comparison function must 
 support unconditional transitivity, regardless of element type.  (This is 
 typically easy to achieve by using <span class="v">&lt;&lt;</span> as a fallback in case of malformed 
 elements.)</p> 
 
 <p>The Codewalker demo books have been improved to use built-in function 
 nat-listp and weaken the hyps (state invariant) so that the state components 
 consist of integers, not naturals.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> now uses an improved theory for better <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">def-gl-clause-processor</a> event performance.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____TEMPLATE-SUBST.html">template-subst</a> tool now has some extended repetition 
 capabilities.</p> 
 
 <p>Various other libraries have received minor cleanups.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Build System Updates</h3> 
 
 <p><a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a>, et al. now tolerate <span class="v">( include-book...</span> instead 
 of <span class="v">(include-book...</span>, etc.</p> 
 
 <p>Errors during portcullis events (i.e., <span class="v">.acl2</span> files) should now cause 
 certification to fail; many books have been updated to avoid problems that 
 were, until now, just being ignored.</p> 
 
 <p>Various updates have been made to the Jenkins scripts to keep things up to 
 date.</p> 
 
 <p>For most Lisps, <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> will now include garbage collection 
 messages in output logs files.  This may occasionally be useful when debugging 
 performance issues.</p>
