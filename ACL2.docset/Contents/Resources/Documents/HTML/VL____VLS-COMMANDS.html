<p>A simple command format for interfacing between Lisp and Javascript.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>The <a href="VL____VL-SERVER.html">vl-server</a> makes many Lisp functions available for use by the 
Javascript code that runs the module browser.  To make interfacing between 
Javascript and Lisp simpler, we adopt certain conventions for how these 
commands work.</p> 
 
<p>A few of VL server operations, such as those for selecting models, are 
special and do not follow the normal conventions.  However, for the most part, 
we are generally wanting to deal with commands where:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The command is a <span class="v">get</span> operation that affects no state except perhaps 
for implicit state like memoization tables, hons spaces, etc.  We'll arrange so 
that the memo tables and hons spaces are set up correctly before invoking the 
command.</li> 
 
<li>The model has already been selected.  We'll arrange so that the server code 
will access the proper model, and invoke our Lisp command function with the 
selected <a href="VL____VLS-DATA-P.html">vls-data-p</a> structure as one of its arguments.</li> 
 
<li>The command may need other arguments.  To keep the command format regular, 
we'll require the Lisp function to take any extra arguments as strings, and it 
will be responsible for parsing these as necessary, e.g., to convert line 
numbers from <span class="v">"5"</span> into <span class="v">5</span>.</li> 
 
<li>The command may produce JSON or HTML formatted output.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h3>JSON Commands</h3> 
 
<p>Most commands need to dive down into part of the model and retrieve some 
information.  This process might fail or succeed.  For uniformity on the 
Javascript side, we will expect each JSON-producing command to signal its 
failure by producing a JSON-encoded error message of the form:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">{":ERROR": "Couldn't do such and so..."}</pre> 
 
<p>This can be done by calling <a href="VL____VLS-FAIL.html">vls-fail</a>.  Meanwhile, every 
JSON-producing command that succeeds should produce a result of the form:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">{":ERROR": false,
 ":VALUE": ...actual result goes here...}
}</pre> 
 
<p>This can be done by calling <a href="VL____VLS-SUCCESS.html">vls-success</a>.</p> 
 
<h3>HTML Commands</h3> 
 
<p>HTML producing commands are assumed to never fail.  Their content is 
generally intended to be sent directly to the web browser and not processed 
further.  An HTML-producing command can generally produce a simple error 
message in HTML format.</p>
