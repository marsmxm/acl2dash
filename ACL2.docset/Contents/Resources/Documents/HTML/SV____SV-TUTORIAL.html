<p>Basic tutorial: how to use the svex package to do datapath verification.</p> <p>The subtopics are listed in the intended order of the 
tutorial, which first covers verification of a simple 16-bit combinational ALU 
module, then a counter module to illustrate how to deal with state over time, 
and finally a multiplier implementation to show how to structurally decompose 
your proofs.</p> 
 
<p>Note: A much higher level of detail is present in the comments of this book 
than in the xdoc tutorial.  The xdoc tutorial is intended to give a high-level 
idea of how to do it; to actually replicate it, you will likely want to look at 
the sources.</p>
