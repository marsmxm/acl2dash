<p>Sets whether or not RP-Rewriter should print used rules when rewriting 
 a conjecture.</p><p>(show-rules  <span class="v">&lt;nil-OR-t-OR-:cnt&gt;</span>)   submits  an  event   that  changes 
 RP-Rewriter's behaviour on  saving and printing used rules. When  set to t, it 
 prints rule in a fashion similar to the built-in rewriter but only differently 
 for meta-rules.  When set  to :cnt,  it also  attaches a  number to  each rune 
 showing how many  times they are used,  and how many times they  failed due to 
 unrelieved hypotheses.  These entries are  saved in rules-used field  of stobj 
 rp::rp-state. </p>
