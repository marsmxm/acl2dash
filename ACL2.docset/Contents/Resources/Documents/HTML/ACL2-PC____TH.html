 <p>Print hypotheses and the current subterm.  The printing of hypotheses (and 
 perhaps governors) are controlled as in the <span class="v">hyps</span> command; see <a href="ACL2-PC____HYPS.html">ACL2-pc::hyps</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Historical note: The name <span class="v">th</span> is adapted from the Gypsy Verification 
 Environment, where <span class="v">th</span> abbreviates the command <span class="v">theorem</span>, which says to 
 print information on the current goal.</p>
