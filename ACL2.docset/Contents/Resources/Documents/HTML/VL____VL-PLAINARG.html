<p>Representation of a single argument in a plain argument list.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>expr — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-EXPR.html">vl-maybe-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Expression being connected to the port.  In programming languages 
              parlance, this is the <i>actual</i>.  Note that this may be 
              <span class="v">nil</span> because Verilog allows expressions to be "blank", in 
              which case they represent an unconnected wire.</dd> 
 
<dt>portname — <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>Not part of the Verilog syntax.  This <b>may</b> indicate the 
              name of the port (i.e., the <i>formal</i>) that this expression 
              is connected to; see below.</dd> 
 
<dt>dir — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-DIRECTION.html">vl-maybe-direction</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Not part of the Verilog syntax.  This <b>may</b> indicate the 
              direction of this port; see below.</dd> 
 
<dt>atts — <a href="VL____VL-ATTS.html">vl-atts</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Any attributes associated with this argument.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>There are two kinds of argument lists for module instantiations, 
which we call <i>plain</i> and <i>named</i> arguments.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">modname instname ( 1, 2, 3 );             &lt;-- "plain" arguments
modname instname ( .a(1), .b(2), .c(3) ); &lt;-- "named" arguments</pre> 
 
<p>A <span class="v">vl-plainarg-p</span> represents a single argument in a plain argument 
list.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">dir</span> is initially <span class="v">nil</span> but may get filled in by the <a href="VL____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> transformation to indicate whether this port for this argument is 
an input, output, or inout for the module or gate being instantiated.  After 
<a href="VL____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a>, all well-formed <b>gate</b> instances will have their 
direction information computed and so you may rely upon the <span class="v">dir</span> field for 
gate instances.  <b>HOWEVER</b>, for <b>module</b> instances the direction of a 
port may not be apparent; see <a href="VL____VL-PORT-DIRECTION.html">vl-port-direction</a> for details.  So even 
after <a href="VL____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> some arguments to module instances may not have a 
<span class="v">dir</span> annotation, and you should generally not rely on the <span class="v">dir</span> field 
for module instances.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">portname</span> is similar.  The <a href="VL____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> transformation may 
sometimes be able to fill in the name of the port, but this is meant only as a 
convenience for error message generation.  This field should <b>never</b> be 
used for anything that is semantically important.  No argument to a gate 
instance will ever have a portname.  Also, since not every <a href="VL____VL-PORT-P.html">vl-port-p</a> has 
a name, some arguments to module instances may also not be given 
portnames.</p>
