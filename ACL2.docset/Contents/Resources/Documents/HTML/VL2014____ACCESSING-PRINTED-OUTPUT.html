<p>How to access the characters that have been printed.</p><p>Once you are done printing, you typically want to access the 
characters that have been printed, e.g., as a character list or string.  You 
might directly access the <span class="v">rchars</span> field of <a href="VL2014____PS.html">ps</a>, using, e.g., <span class="tt">(vl-ps-&gt;rchars)</span>, but it is a weird <a href="VL2014____VL-PRINTEDLIST-P.html">vl-printedlist-p</a> structure, is in 
reverse order, and is generally not very convenient to work with.  So, it is 
typically more convenient to use these alternatives.</p>
