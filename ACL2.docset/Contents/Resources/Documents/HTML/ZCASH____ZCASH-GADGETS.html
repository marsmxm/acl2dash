<p>A collection of Zcash gadgets, with formal specifications and proofs.</p><p>The <span class="v">.txt</span> files in this directory contain 
     ACL2 representations of R1CS and tree gadgets, 
     generated via the <span class="v">bellman</span> and <span class="v">librustzcash</span> Rust libraries. 
     The R1CS and tree gadgets are functionally equivalent, 
     but the tree gadgets have more structure than the R1CS gadgets; 
     the additional structure has been derived 
     by modifying the Rust code that generates the gadgets 
     to output some additional information.</p><p>The <span class="v">.lisp</span> files in this directory contain 
     ACL2 specifications and proofs of the gadgets. 
     The specifications are generally thin wrappers of 
     existing specifications in the Zcash formalization one directory up, 
     or in the elliptic curve library.</p>
