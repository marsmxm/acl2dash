<p>ACL2 Version  2.9.4 (February, 2006) Notes</p><p>Also see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-9-1.html">note-2-9-1</a>, see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-9-2.html">note-2-9-2</a>, and see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-9-3.html">note-2-9-3</a> for other changes since the last non-incremental 
 release (Version_2.9).</p> 
 
 <p>A soundness bug has been fixed that was due to inadequate checking of 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> rules in the presence of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>. 
 Specifically, a <span class="v">local</span> <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a></span> event is insufficient for 
 supporting a <span class="v">:meta</span> rule (an example is shown in source function 
 <span class="v">chk-acceptable-rules</span>).  Thanks to Dave Greve and Jared Davis for bringing 
 this bug to our attention, by sending a proof of <span class="v">nil</span> that exploited this 
 bug.  The fix is to check legality of <span class="v">:meta</span> rules even when skipping 
 proofs during an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event or the second pass of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed problem with parallel make for workshop books by adding a dependency 
 line to <span class="v">books/workshops/2003/Makefile</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Default hints (see <a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a>) no longer prevent the use of 
 <span class="v">:INSTRUCTIONS</span> (see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>).  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 pointing out this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>New functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-EQ.html">remove-eq</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-EQUAL.html">remove-equal</a></span> have been defined, 
 in analogy to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____REMOVE.html">remove</a></span>.  These two symbols have also been added to 
 <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>.  Thanks to David Rager for pointing out that 
 <span class="v">remove-equal</span> was missing.  Moreover, the definitions of <span class="v">delete1-eq</span> 
 and <span class="v">delete1-equal</span> have been eliminated.  Function <span class="v">remove1-eq</span>, now in 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode in source file <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span>, serves in place of 
 <span class="v">delete1-eq</span>, with corresponding new function definitions for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE1.html">remove1</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE1-EQUAL.html">remove1-equal</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The symbol <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSERT_42.html">assert$</a></span> has been added to <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>.  Thanks 
 to Jared Davis for the suggestion.</p> 
 
 <p>Added SBCL support.  Thanks to Juho Snellman for significant assistance 
 with the port.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for suggesting the use of feature 
 <span class="v">:acl2-mv-as-values</span> with SBCL, which can allow thread-level parallelism in 
 the underlying lisp; we have done so when feature <span class="v">:sb-thread</span> is 
 present.</p> 
 
 <p>We have continued to incorporate suggestions for wording improvements in 
 documentation and error messages.  Thanks to all who send these suggestions, 
 especially to Eric Smith, who has suggested the vast majority of them.</p> 
 
 <p>Made a small improvement to errors and warnings caused on behalf of <a href="ACL2____SET-ENFORCE-REDUNDANCY.html">set-enforce-redundancy</a>, to indicate when an event of the same name already 
 exists.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="v">books/misc/rtl-untranslate.lisp</span> that was causing a 
 guard violation when adding a new entry for an existing key.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in translation to internal form that caused <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> 
 and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> to have difficulties handling ignored variables in 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> forms.  Thanks to Sandip Ray to bringing this issue to our 
 attention with a helpful example.</p> 
 
 <p>The form <span class="v">(push :acl2-mv-as-values *features*)</span> has been added in source 
 file <span class="v">acl2-init.lisp</span> for SBCL and OpenMCL only, in order to support 
 parallel execution (looking to the future...).</p> 
 
 <p>Default-hints (see <a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a>) were being ignored inside the 
 <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>, but no longer.  Thanks to John Erickson for bringing 
 this problem to our attention and providing a simple example of it.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified the <span class="v">TAGS</span> <span class="v">"make"</span> target (specifically, function 
 <span class="v">make-tags</span>) so that it is gracefully skipped if the <span class="v">etags</span> program is 
 not found.  Thanks to David Rager for pointing out this issue.</p> 
 
 <p>Sandip Ray has re-worked the supporting materials for his ACL2 Workshop 
 2003 talk (originally with John Matthews and Mark Tuttle), to run in a few 
 minutes.  The result is in <span class="v">workshops/2003/ray-matthews-tuttle/support/</span> 
 and is included in the full ACL2 regression suite.  Thanks, Sandip.</p> 
 
 <p>Debian releases of ACL2 had created superfluous <span class="v">.cert.final</span> files when 
 certifying books.  This has been fixed; thanks to Jared Davis for noticing 
 this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Jared Davis has pointed out that ``If you add a <span class="v">:backchain-limit-lst 0</span> 
 to a rewrite rule whose hypotheses are all forced, then ACL2 `really assumes 
 them' without trying to relieve them right there through rewriting.'' 
 Relevant documentation has been added for <span class="v">:backchain-limit-lst</span>; see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new version of the rtl library has been included in <span class="v">books/rtl/rel5/</span>. 
 Thanks to David Russinoff for contributing hand proofs for the new lemmas, and 
 to Matt Kaufmann for carrying out their mechanization.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a></span> that was failing to set the initial 
 <span class="v">cbd</span> according to the current directory when starting up ACL2.  Thanks to 
 Camm Maguire for bringing our attention to this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Variables introduced during <span class="v">let*</span> abstraction are now in the current 
 package.  Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting such a change.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-LET_A2-ABSTRACTIONP.html">set-let*-abstractionp</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now allowed for two definitions to be considered the same from the 
 standpoint of redundancy (see <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>) when one specifies a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span> of <span class="v">t</span> and the other has no explicit <span class="v">:guard</span> 
 (hence, the guard is implicitly <span class="v">t</span>).  Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing 
 this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>(For users of <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span>) There have been a few enhancements 
 to distributed file <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> (skip this paragraph if you 
 don't use that file):</p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p>o <span class="v">Control-t q</span> continues to compare windows ignoring 
 whitespace, but now, a prefix argument can be given to control case is also 
 ignored (ignore case if positive, else use case).</p> 
 
 <p>o <span class="v">Control-t Control-l</span> has been defined to be similar to <span class="v">Control-t
    l</span>, except that proofs are skipped and output is suppressed.</p> 
 
 <p>o <span class="v">Control-t u</span> has been defined to print, to the shell buffer, a 
   <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT_12.html">ubt!</a></span> form for the command containing the cursor.</p> 
 
 <p>o Control-t Control-f buries the current buffer.</p> 
 
 <p>o <span class="v">Meta-x new-shell</span> now puts the new shell buffer in <span class="v">shell-mode</span> 
   (thanks to David Rager for noticing this issue).</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>Linear arithmetic has been modified so that we do not generate the equality 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> term1 term2)</span> from the pair of inequalities <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> term1 term2)</span> 
 and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> term2 term1)</span> in the case that we would have to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> both 
 <span class="v">term1</span> and <span class="v">term2</span> to be <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-NUMBERP.html">ACL2-numberp</a></span>s.  Thanks to Dave Greve 
 for providing a motivating example and to Robert Krug for providing a fix.</p> 
 
 <p>The event <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">delete-include-book-dir</a></span> had not been allowed inside <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> forms.  This was an oversight, and has been 
 fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>Sandip Ray has contributed a new library of books to support proofs of 
 partial and total correctness of sequential programs based on assertional 
 reasoning, in <span class="v">books/symbolic/</span>.  This work is based on the paper 
 J. Matthews, J S. Moore, S. Ray, and D. Vroon, ``A Symbolic Simulation 
 Approach to Assertional Program Verification,'' currently in draft form.  In 
 particular, the books include the macro <span class="v">defsimulate</span>, which automatically 
 transforms inductive assertion proofs of correctness of sequential programs to 
 the corresponding interpreter proofs.  See the <span class="v">README</span> in that 
 directory.</p> 
 
 <p>We have changed the implementation of <span class="v">:dir :system</span> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  This change will not affect you if you build an ACL2 
 executable in the normal manner, leaving in place the <span class="v">books/</span> subdirectory 
 of the source directory; nor will it affect you if you download a GCL Debian 
 binary distribution.  The change is that if environment variable 
 <span class="v">ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS</span> is set, then it specifies the distributed books 
 directory, i.e., the directory determined by <span class="v">:dir :system</span>.  You may find 
 it convenient to set this variable in your ACL2 script file (typically, 
 <span class="v">saved_acl2</span>).  If it is set when you build ACL2, the generated script for 
 running ACL2 will begin by setting <span class="v">ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS</span> to that value. 
 Thanks to various people who have discussed this issue, in particular Jared 
 Davis who sent an email suggesting consideration of the use of an environment 
 variable, and to Eric Smith who helped construct this paragraph.  (Note that 
 this use of <span class="v">ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS</span> replaces the use of <span class="v">ACL2_SRC_BOOKS</span> 
 described previously; see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-9-1.html">note-2-9-1</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 now automatically deletes files <span class="v">TMP*.lisp</span> created during the 
 build process and created by <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span>.  If you want these to be 
 saved, evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> keep-tmp-files t)</span> in the ACL2 loop or in raw 
 Lisp.  The <span class="v">clean</span> target for the standard `make' process for certifying 
 books (see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION-CLASSIC.html">books-certification-classic</a>) will however delete all files 
 <span class="v">TMP*.*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">TMP</span> files discussed just above now generally include the current 
 process ID in their names, e.g., <span class="v">TMP@16388@1.lisp</span> instead of 
 <span class="v">TMP1.lisp</span>.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for suggesting this measure, which will 
 reduce the possibility that two different processes will attempt to access the 
 same temporary file.</p> 
 
 <p>Now, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> will print the information formerly printed by 
 <span class="v">:pe!</span>, slightly enhanced to work for logical names that are strings, not 
 just symbols.  Thanks to Warren Hunt for leading us to this change by 
 suggesting that <span class="v">:pe nth</span> print the definition of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We eliminated spurious warnings that could occur in raw mode in OpenMCL or 
 CMUCL when <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s are present.  We thank Juho Snellman for pointing out 
 the relevant bug and appropriate fix.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Mfc-rw</span> now takes a third argument that can specify an arbitrary known 
 equivalence relation; see <a href="ACL2____EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>.  Thanks to Dave Greve 
 for discussions suggesting this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>A small modification to a symbol-reading function allows documentation 
 string processing on Windows systems that use CR/LF for line breaks.  Thanks 
 to William Cook for bringing this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>The documentation has been improved on how to control the printing of ACL2 
 terms.  See <a href="ACL2____USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS-TABLE.html">user-defined-functions-table</a>.  Thanks to Sandip Ray for 
 asking a question that led to the example presented there.</p> 
 
 <p>We fixed an inefficiency that could cause an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> command to seem to 
 hang at its conclusion.  Thanks to Sandip Ray for pointing out this 
 problem.</p> 
 
 <p>We checked that ACL2 runs under LispWorks 4.4.5, and have inhibited 
 redefinition warnings.</p> 
 
 <p>Two changes have been made on behalf of congruence-based reasoning.  Thanks 
 to Dave Greve for examples and discussions that have led to these changes, and 
 to Eric Smith and Vernon Austel, who also sent relevant examples.</p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p>o When a call of the new unary function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a></span> 
 is encountered by the rewriter, its argument will be rewritten twice.  This 
 solves certain problems encountered in congruence-based rewriting.  Warnings 
 for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rules will suggest when 
 calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a></span> on variables in hypotheses are likely to be a 
 good idea.  See <a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>o Hypotheses of the form <span class="v">(equiv var (<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a> term))</span>, where 
 <span class="v">equiv</span> is a known <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation and <span class="v">var</span> is a free 
 variable (see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>), will bind <span class="v">var</span> to the result of 
 rewriting <span class="v">term</span> twice.  Previously, hypotheses of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> var
 term)</span> would bind a free variable <span class="v">var</span>, but the call had to be of 
 <span class="v">equal</span> rather than of an arbitrary known equivalence 
 relation.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>The following improvements were made in support of ACL2 on top of 
 OpenMCL.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>o New versions of OpenMCL that do not have <span class="v">:mcl</span> in Lisp variable 
 <span class="v">*features*</span> will now work with ACL2.  Thanks to David Rager for bringing 
 this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>o Added support for OpenMCL 1.0 for 64-bit DarwinPPC/MacOS X, thanks to 
 Robert Krug.</p> 
 
 <p>o Fixed tracing in OpenMCL so that the level is reset to 1 even if there 
 has been an abort.</p> 
 
 <p>o Added support in OpenMCL for <span class="v">WET</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>o Incorporated suggestions from Gary Byers for printing the ``Welcome to 
 OpenMCL'' prompt before initially entering the ACL2 loop and, and for setting 
 useful environment variable <span class="v">CCL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY</span> in the ACL2 
 script.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>Fixed a long-standing bug in forward-chaining, where variable-free 
 hypotheses were being evaluated even if the <a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a>s of 
 their function symbols had been disabled.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing 
 this bug to our attention by sending a simple example that exhibited the 
 problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved reporting by the <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> utility upon failure to 
 relieve hypotheses in the presence of free variables, so that information is 
 shown about the attempting bindings.  See <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES-EXAMPLES-REWRITE.html">free-variables-examples-rewrite</a>.  Thanks to Eric Smith for requesting this 
 improvement.  Also improved the <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> loop so that terms, in 
 particular from unifying substitutions, are printed without hiding subterms by 
 default.  The user can control such hiding (``evisceration''); see :DOC 
 <span class="v">set-brr-term-evisc-tuple</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new directory <span class="v">books/defexec/</span> contains books that illustrate the use 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEXEC.html">defexec</a></span>.  Thanks to the contributors of those books 
 (see the <span class="v">README</span> file in that directory).</p> 
 
 <p>The directories <span class="v">books/rtl/rel2</span> and <span class="v">books/rtl/rel3</span> are no longer 
 distributed.  They are still available by email request.  (Subdirectory 
 <span class="v">rel1/</span> supports some of the optional <span class="v">workshop/</span> books, so it is still 
 distributed.)</p> 
 
 <p>Added book <span class="v">books/misc/sticky-disable.lisp</span> to manage <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a> 
 that might otherwise be modified adversely by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  Thanks to 
 Ray Richards for a query that led to our development of this tool.</p> 
 
 <p>The commands <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a>)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____QUIT.html">quit</a>)</span> may now be used to quit ACL2 and 
 Lisp completely; in fact they macroexpand to calls of the same function as 
 does <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a></span> (which is now a macro).  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 suggesting the new aliases.  (OpenMCL-only comment:) These all work for 
 OpenMCL even inside the ACL2 loop.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="v">wet</span> now hides structure by default on large expressions. 
 However, a new optional argument controls this behavior, for example avoiding 
 such hiding if that argument is <span class="v">nil</span>.  Thanks to Hanbing Liu for pointing 
 out that <span class="v">wet</span> was not helpful for very large terms.</p> 
 
 <p>We have fixed a bug in the forward-chaining mechanism that, very rarely, 
 could cause a proof to be aborted needlessly with an obscure error message. 
 Thanks to Jared Davis for sending us an example that evoked this bug.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was causing proof output on behalf of 
 <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> to be confusing, because it failed to mention that 
 the number of constraints may be different from the number of subgoals 
 generated.  Thanks to Robert Krug for pointing out this confusing output.  The 
 fix also causes the reporting of rules used when silently simplifying the 
 constraints to create the subgoals.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in handling of leading <span class="v">./</span> in pathnames, as in: 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "./foo")</span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing this bug to 
 our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Made a small fix for handling of free variables of <span class="v">:</span><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rules, which had erroneously acted as though a hypothesis 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> var term)</span> can bind the variable <span class="v">var</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A small change has been made for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules for 
 hypotheses of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> var term)</span>, where <span class="v">var</span> is a free 
 variable and no variable of <span class="v">term</span> is free (see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>).  As 
 with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rules, we now bind 
 <span class="v">var</span> to <span class="v">term</span> even if <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> u term)</span> happens to be known in the 
 current context for some term <span class="v">u</span>.  Also as with <span class="v">:rewrite</span> and 
 <span class="v">:linear</span> rules, similar handling is given to hypotheses <span class="v">(equiv var
 (<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a> term))</span> where <span class="v">equiv</span> is a known <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> 
 relation.</p> 
 
 <p>We changed the handling of free variables in hypotheses of <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules being handled by the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>'s <span class="v">rewrite</span> 
 (<span class="v">r</span>) command, in complete analogy to the change described just above for 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules.</p> 
 
 <p>The installation instructions have been updated for obtaining GCL on a 
 Macintosh.  Thanks to Robert Krug for supplying this information and to Camm 
 Maguire for simplifying the process by eliminating the <span class="v">gettext</span> 
 dependency.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span> is now an event, so it may be placed in <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Previously, a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a></span> call could fail because of file permission 
 issues, yet ACL2 (and the underlying Lisp) would quit anyhow.  This has been 
 fixed.  Thanks to Peter Dillinger for bringing this problem to our 
 attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Jared Davis, with assistance from David Rager, has updated his ordered sets 
 library, <span class="v">books/finite-set-theory/osets/</span>.  See file <span class="v">CHANGES.html</span> in 
 that directory.</p> 
 
 <p>A new function, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RESET-KILL-RING.html">reset-kill-ring</a></span>, has been provided for the rare 
 user who encounters memory limitations.  See <a href="ACL2____RESET-KILL-RING.html">reset-kill-ring</a>.</p>
