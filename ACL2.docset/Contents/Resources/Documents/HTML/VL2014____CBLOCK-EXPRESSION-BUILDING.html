<p>Convert a combinational always block into assignments.</p><p>Basic examples of what we're trying to do here:</p> 
<pre class="code">always @(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a>)            ----&gt;   assign lhs = condition1 ? {expr1}
   if (condition1)                        : condition2 ? {expr2}
      lhs = expr1;                        : {expr3}
   else if (condition2)
      lhs = expr2;
   else
      lhs = expr3;

always @(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a>)            ----&gt;   assign lhs = condition ? {expr2} : {expr1}
   lhs = expr1;
   if (condition)
      lhs = expr2;</pre> 
 
<p>Note that this conversion isn't quite right if the widths of the <span class="v">expr</span>s 
above can differ.  For instance, in the merged expressions like <span class="v">condition ?
expr2 : expr1</span>, suppose the width of <span class="v">expr1</span> and <span class="v">lhs</span> are 5, but the 
width of <span class="v">expr2</span> is 7.  Now the width of the new, combined expression is 
also <span class="v">7</span>, and (because of the sizing rules) the new expression would be 
wider than <span class="v">expr1</span>.</p> 
 
<p>To avoid this, we locally use the <a href="VL2014____STMTTEMPS.html">stmttemps</a> transform before trying 
to carry out this expression building.  This should ensure that all lhses/rhses 
are well-typed and have compatible widths.  The excessive use of concatenations 
above ensures that everything is unsigned, to avoid creating badly typed 
<span class="v">?:</span> expressions.</p> 
 
<p>Slight twist.  If we know that this is supposed to be a combinational always 
block because it's written with <span class="v">always_comb</span>, then we allow the lhs to not 
be written in every branch.  In this case a Verilog simulator may not trigger 
any update of the variable, essentially treating it like a latch.  However, it 
seems quite likely that a synthesis tool will not infer a latch.  To try to 
avoid making mistakes here, we want to make sure to drive the variable to Xes 
in this case.</p> 
 
<p>To drive the variable to Xes, a simple thing to do is, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always_comb           ---&gt;  always_comb
   if (condition)              lhs = XXXX
      lhs = expr;              if (condition)
   if (condition2)                lhs = expr;
      lhs = expr2;             if (condition2)
                                  lhs = expr2;</pre> 
 
<p>This is safe even if all the branches are covered (in which case we're 
simply setting the variable to X and then to its real value).</p>
