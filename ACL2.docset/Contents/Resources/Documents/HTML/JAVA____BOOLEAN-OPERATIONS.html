<p>Java boolean operations [JLS:4.2.5].</p><p>Here we formalize all the strict operations 
     that take boolean operands and return boolean results.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.5] also lists 
     the conditional operators <span class="v">&amp;&amp;</span>, <span class="v">||</span>, and <span class="v">? :</span>, 
     but those are non-strict, 
     and therefore must be formalized as part of expression evaluation.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.5] also lists the string concatenation operator <span class="v">+</span>, 
     but that is best formalized in terms of a boolean-to-string conversion, 
     elsewhere.</p>
