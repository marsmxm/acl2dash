 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PKG-IMPORTS.html">Pkg-imports</a> pkg)</span> returns a duplicate-free list of all symbols 
 imported into <span class="v">pkg</span>, which should be the name of a package known to ACL2. 
 For example, suppose <span class="v">"MY-PKG"</span> was created by</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "MY-PKG" '(ACL2::ABC LISP::CAR)).</pre> 
 
 <p>Then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PKG-IMPORTS.html">pkg-imports</a> "MY-PKG")</span> equals the list <span class="v">(ACL2::ABC
 LISP::CAR)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">pkg</span> is not a string, then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PKG-IMPORTS.html">pkg-imports</a> pkg)</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.  If 
 <span class="v">pkg</span> is a string but not the name of a package known to ACL2, then the 
 value of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PKG-IMPORTS.html">pkg-imports</a> pkg)</span> is unspecified, and its evaluation 
 will fail to yield a value.  By ``the symbols imported into <span class="v">pkg</span>'' we mean 
 the symbols imported into <span class="v">pkg</span> by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> event that introduced 
 <span class="v">pkg</span>.  There are no imports for built-in packages except for the 
 <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> package, which imports the symbols in the list value of the 
 constant <span class="v">*common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*</span>.  In particular, 
 this is the case for the <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span> package.  Users familiar with 
 Common Lisp may find this surprising, since in actual Common Lisp 
 implementations it is often the case that many symbols in that package are 
 imported from other packages.  However, ACL2 treats all symbols in the 
 constant <span class="v">*common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*</span> as having a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> of <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span>, as though they were not 
 imported.  ACL2 admits a symbol imported into in the <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span> 
 package only if it belongs to that list: any attempt to read any other symbol 
 imported into the <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span> package, or to produce such a symbol 
 with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERN_42.html">intern$</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a></span>, will cause an 
 error.</p> 
 
 <p>The following axioms formalize properties of <span class="v">pkg-imports</span> discussed 
 above (use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> to view them).</p>
