<p>A macro that causes RP-Rewriter to throw a readable error when a 
 certain pattern occurs.</p><p> 
 In cases where users want to make sure that a term of a certain pattern 
 does not occur, or it is taken care of by a rewrite rule with higher 
 priority. </p> 
 
<pre class="code"><span class="v">(<a href="RP____DEF-RW-OPENER-ERROR.html">def-rw-opener-error</a>
  &lt;name&gt; ;; a unique name for the opener error rule
  &lt;pattern&gt; ;; a pattern to match/unify
  ;;optional keys
  :do-not-print (a b c ...)   ;; a list of variables not to print when
                              ;; RP-Rewriter encounters the term and
                              ;; unifies with variables. Default: nil.
  :disabled &lt;t-or-nil&gt;        ;; whether or not opener error rule should be
                              ;; disabled.

</pre> 
 
<p> A def-rw-opener-error event will submit a disabled rewrite rule with 
defthm, but it will be enabled in RP-Rewriter's rule-set by default. Such rules 
might be useful if you are using some rewrite rules with hypotheses and want to 
make sure that hypotheses are relieved, otherwise this rule will be used and 
RP-Rewriter will throw an eligible error.</p>
