<p>ATJ tutorial: About the Simplified UML Class Diagrams.</p><p>This tutorial uses simplified <a href="http://uml.org" target="_blank"><nobr>UML<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://uml.org"></nobr></a> class diagrams 
    to illustrate the <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-AIJ.html">AIJ</a> Java classes. 
    These simplified UML diagrams are briefly described 
    in this tutorial page. 
    It may be skipped if the reader is already familiary with UML.</p><h5>Diagram Notation</h5><p>Each class is depicted as a box containing its name. 
    Abstract classes have italicized names. 
    Public classes have names preceded by <span class="v">+</span>, 
    while package-private classes have names preceded by <span class="v">~</span>.</p><p>Inheritance (`is a') relationships 
    are indicated by lines with hollow triangular tips. 
    Composition (`part of') relationships 
    are indicated by lines with solid rhomboidal tips, 
    annotated with 
    the names of the containing class instances' fields 
    that store the contained class instances, 
    and with the multiplicity of the contained instances 
    for each containing instance 
    (<span class="v">0..*</span> means `zero or more').</p><p>The dashed boxes are just replicas to avoid clutter.</p><h5>Simplifications</h5><p>These UML class diagrams are simplified because 
    the class boxes do not contain fields and methods, 
    as they should in a full UML class diagram.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Previous:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-AIJ.html">Relationship with AIJ</a></p><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-ACL2-VALUES.html">Java Representation of the ACL2 Values</a></p>
