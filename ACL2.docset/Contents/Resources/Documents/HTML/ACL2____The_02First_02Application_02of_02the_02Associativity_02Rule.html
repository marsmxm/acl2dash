<p>The First Application of the Associativity Rule</p><p>So here we see our associativity rule being used!</p> 
 
 <p>The rewriter sweeps the conjecture in a <b>leftmost innermost</b> fashion, 
 applying rewrite rules as it goes.</p> 
 
 <p>The associativity rule is used many times in this sweep.  The first 
 ``target'' is highlighted below.  Click on it to see what happens:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><b>Current Conjecture</b>: 
(equal (app (app <a href="ACL2____A_02Sketch_02of_02How_02the_02Rewriter_02Works.html">(app (app x1 x2) (app x3 x4))</a> (app x5 x6)) x7) 
       (app x1 (app (app x2 x3) (app (app x4 x5) (app x6 x7)))))
