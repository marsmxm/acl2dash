<p>Renaming of variables.</p><p>See <a href="YUL____DISAMBIGUATOR.html">disambiguator</a> for background.</p><p>Here we characterize, relationally, the renaming of variables. 
     The predicate mentioned in <a href="YUL____DISAMBIGUATOR.html">disambiguator</a>, 
     i.e. the one that relates original and transformed code, 
     is actually a function that returns success or failure. 
     More precisely, as with other aspects of Yul, 
     it is a family of functions, 
     with a member for each kind of Yul syntactic entity 
     (expression, statement, etc.); 
     however, for simplicity below we refer to this family as just a function.</p><p>This function cannot just operate on old and new code, 
     intended as pieces of abstract syntax like expressions and statements. 
     Since the code may reference variables 
     defined outside the code being operated upon, 
     we need, as additional arguments, 
     information about how the variables in scope 
     are renamed in the code being operated upon. 
     This information is calculated 
     by operating on the enclosing code, 
     prior to recursively operating on the enclosed code. 
     Thus, in case of success, in general this function returns 
     updated renaming information.</p>
