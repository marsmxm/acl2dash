<p>Throw away any <span class="v">initial</span> statements and add non-fatal <a href="VL____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> to the affected modules.</p><p>Initial statements can be important for simulation, but are 
meaningless if we want to consider the post synthesis/build behavior of the 
actual part.  Throwing them away, then, is basically reasonable for any 
back-end tool that wants to analyze the behavior of the synthesized 
modules.</p> 
 
<p>This transform can be run at any time.  Back in VL2014 it was important to 
run it somewhere before the old <a href="VL2014____ALWAYS-TOP.html">vl2014::always-top</a> transform, since some 
always-block code was reluctant to process modules with <span class="v">initial</span> 
statements.  That probably doesn't matter anymore.</p>
