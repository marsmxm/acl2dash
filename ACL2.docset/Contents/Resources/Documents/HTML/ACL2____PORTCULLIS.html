<p>The gate guarding the entrance to a certified book</p><p>The certificate (see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for general information) of 
 a certified file contains a portcullis and a <a href="ACL2____KEEP.html">keep</a>.  These names come 
 from castle lore.  The portcullis of a castle is an iron grate that slides up 
 through the ceiling of the tunnel-like entrance.  The portcullis of a book 
 ensures that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> does not start to read the book until the 
 appropriate context has been created.</p> 
 
 <p>Technically, the portcullis consists of the <a href="ACL2____VERSION.html">version</a> number of the 
 certifying ACL2, a list of <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s used to create the ``certification 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>'' and an alist specifying <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> values for all the 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> included in that <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  The portcullis is constructed 
 automatically by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> from the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> in which <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> is called, but that <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> must have certain properties 
 described below.  After listing the properties we discuss the issues in a more 
 leisurely manner.</p> 
 
 <p>Each <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> in the portcullis must be either a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> form 
 or an embedded event form (see <a href="ACL2____EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Consider a book to be certified.  The book is a file containing event 
 forms.  Suppose the file contains references to such symbols as 
 <span class="v">my-pkg::fn</span> and <span class="v">acl2-arith::cancel</span>, but that the book itself does not 
 create the packages.  Then a hard Lisp error would be caused merely by the 
 attempt to read the expressions in the book.  The corresponding <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>s cannot be written into the book itself because the book must be 
 compilable and Common Lisp compilers differ on the rules concerning the inline 
 definition of new packages.  The only safe course is to make all <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>s occur outside of compiled files.</p> 
 
 <p>More generally, when a book is certified it is certified within some 
 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  That ``certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>'' contains not only 
 the necessary <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>s but also, perhaps, function and constant 
 definitions and maybe even references to other <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> creates the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for a file it recovers from the 
 certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s used to create that <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> from the initial ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  Those <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s become part 
 of the portcullis for the certified book.  In addition, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> 
 records in the portcullis certain <i>book-hash</i> values (see <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a>) for all the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> included in the certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">Include-book</a></span> presumes that it is impossible even to read the 
 contents of a certified book unless the portcullis can be ``raised.'' To raise 
 the portcullis we must be able to execute (possibly redundantly, but certainly 
 without error), all of the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s in the portcullis and then verify 
 that the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> thus included were identical to those used to build the 
 certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> (up to book-hash).  This raising of the portcullis 
 must be done delicately since <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>s are present: we cannot even read 
 a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> in the portcullis until we have successfully executed the 
 previous ones, since packages are being defined.</p> 
 
 <p>Clearly, a book is most useful if it is certified in the most elementary 
 extension possible of the initial logic.  If, for example, your certification 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> happens to contain a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> for <span class="v">"MY-PKG"</span> and the 
 function <span class="v">foo</span>, then those definitions become part of the portcullis for 
 the book.  Every time the book is included, those names will be defined and 
 will have to be either new or redundant (see <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>).  But if 
 those names were not necessary to the certification of the book, their 
 presence would unnecessarily restrict the utility of the book.</p>
