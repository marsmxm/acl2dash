<p>Using the <span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span> flag</p><p>A problem with the example in <a href="ACL2____USING-COMPUTED-HINTS-6.html">using-computed-hints-6</a> is that 
 exactly one simplification occurs between each (effective) firing of the hint. 
 Much more commonly we wish to fire a hint once a subgoal has become stable 
 under simplification.</p> 
 
 <p>A classic example of this is when we are dealing with an interpreter for 
 some state machine.  We typically do not want the ``step'' function to open up 
 on the symbolic representation of a state until that state has been maximally 
 simplified.  We will illustrate with a simple state machine.</p> 
 
 <p>Let us start by defining the step function, <span class="v">stp</span>, and the corresponding 
 <span class="v">run</span> function that applies it a given number of times.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> stp (<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a>)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 s))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> run (<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> n)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> n)
      s
      (run (<a href="ACL2____STP.html">stp</a> s) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> n 1))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The step function here is trivial: a state is just a number and the step 
 function increments it.  In this example we will not be interested in the 
 theorems we prove but in how we prove them.  The formula we will focus on 
 is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (run s 7) xxx))</pre> 
 
 <p>This is not a theorem, of course.  But we want to test our advice on 
 non-theorems because we do not want the advice to work only for proofs that 
 succeed.  (In the past, we gave advice about using computed hints and that 
 advice caused the theorem prover to run forever when given formulas that it 
 couldn't prove — but most of the time the system is presented with 
 formulas it cannot prove!)</p> 
 
 <p>Furthermore, without some kind of additional rules, the <span class="v">(run s 7)</span> 
 expression in the conjecture above will not expand at all, because ACL2's 
 heuristics do not approve.</p> 
 
 <p>In fact, we do not want to take chances that <span class="v">run</span> will be expanded 
 — we want to control its expansion completely.  Therefore, disable 
 <span class="v">run</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> run))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now, what do we want?  (That is always a good question to ask!)  We want 
 <span class="v">(run s 7)</span> to expand ``slowly.''  In particular, we want it to expand 
 once, to <span class="v">(run (<a href="ACL2____STP.html">stp</a> s) 6)</span>.  Then we want the <span class="v">stp</span> to be expanded and 
 fully simplified before the <span class="v">run</span> expression is expanded again.  That is, 
 we want to force the expansion of <span class="v">run</span> whenever the goal is stable under 
 simplification.  This is sometimes called ``staged simplification.''</p> 
 
 <p>We can achieve staged simplification for any given function symbol by 
 defining the functions shown below and then using a simple computed hint:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (run s 7) xxx)
     :hints ((stage run)))</pre> 
 
 <p>By inspecting how <span class="v">stage</span> is defined you can see how to extend it, but 
 we explain as we go.  To experiment, you can just paste the definitions (and 
 defmacro) below into your ACL2 shell and then try the <span class="v">thm</span> command.</p> 
 
 <p>First, define this pair of mutually recursive functions. 
 <span class="v">Find-first-call</span> finds the first call of the function symbol <span class="v">fn</span> in a 
 given term.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> find-first-call (fn term)
 ; Find the first call of fn in term.
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="ACL2____VARIABLEP.html">variablep</a> term) nil)
        ((<a href="ACL2____FQUOTEP.html">fquotep</a> term) nil)
        ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____FFN-SYMB.html">ffn-symb</a> term) fn)
         term)
        (t (find-first-call-lst fn (<a href="ACL2____FARGS.html">fargs</a> term)))))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> find-first-call-lst (fn lst)
 ; Find the first call of fn in a list of terms.
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst) nil)
        (t (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (find-first-call fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst))
               (find-first-call-lst fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst)))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>We will arrange for the computed hint to generate an <span class="v">:EXPAND</span> hint for 
 the first call of <span class="v">fn</span>, whenever the goal becomes stable under 
 simplification.  If no call is found, the hint will do nothing.  To make sure 
 the hint will not loop indefinitely (for example, by forcing <span class="v">fn</span> to expand 
 only to have the rewriter ``fold'' it back up again), we will provide the hint 
 with a bound that stops it after some number of iterations.  Here is the basic 
 function that creates the <span class="v">expand</span> hint and replaces itself to count 
 down.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> stage1 (fn max clause flg)
; If the clause is stable under simplification and there is a call of
; fn in it, expand it.  But don't do it more than max times.
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((temp (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> flg
                  (find-first-call-lst fn clause))))
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> temp
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____ZP.html">zp</a> max)
           (<a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> "~%~%HINT PROBLEM:  The maximum repetition count of ~

                count with the optional second argument to STAGE ~
                (which defaults to 100).  But think about what is ~
                happening! Is each stage permanently eliminating a ~

               fn)
         `(:computed-hint-replacement
            ((stage1 ',fn ,(<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> max 1)
                     clause
                     stable-under-simplificationp))
           :expand (,temp)))
     nil)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Suppose that when <span class="v">stage1</span> is called, <span class="v">fn</span> is the function we want to 
 expand, <span class="v">max</span> is the maximum number of iterations of this expansion, 
 <span class="v">clause</span> is the current goal clause, and <span class="v">flg</span> is the value of the 
 <span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span> flag.  Then if <span class="v">clause</span> is stable and we 
 can find a call of <span class="v">fn</span> in it, we ask whether <span class="v">max</span> is exhausted.  If 
 so, we print an ``error message'' to the comment window with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span> and 
 return <span class="v">nil</span> (the value of <span class="v">cw</span>).  That <span class="v">nil</span> means the hint does 
 nothing.  But if <span class="v">max</span> is not yet exhausted, we return a new hint.  As you 
 can see above, the hint replaces itself with another <span class="v">stage1</span> hint with the 
 same <span class="v">fn</span> and a decremented <span class="v">max</span> to be applied to the new <span class="v">clause</span> 
 and the then-current value of <span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span>.  The hint 
 also contains an <span class="v">:expand</span> directive for the call of <span class="v">fn</span> found.</p> 
 
 <p>Thus, if the computed hint was:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(stage1 'run 5 clause stable-under-simplificationp)</pre> 
 
 <p>and <span class="v">(run s 7)</span> occurs in the clause, then it will generate</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(:computed-hint-replacement
  ((stage1 'run 4 clause stable-under-simplificationp))
 :expand ((run s 7)))</pre> 
 
 <p>which will in turn replace the old <span class="v">stage1</span> hint with the new one and 
 will apply <span class="v">:expand ((run s 7))</span> to the current goal.</p> 
 
 <p>We can make this more convenient by defining the macro:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> stage (fn &amp;optional (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MAX.html">max</a> '100))
 `(stage1 ',fn ,max clause stable-under-simplificationp))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that the macro allows us to either provide the maximum bound or let it 
 default to 100.</p> 
 
 <p>Henceforth, we can type</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (run s 7) xxx)
     :hints ((stage run)))</pre> 
 
 <p>to stage the opening of <span class="v">run</span> up to 100 times, or we can write</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (run s 7) xxx)
     :hints ((stage run 5)))</pre> 
 
 <p>to stage it only 5 times.  In the latter example, the system with print a 
 ``error message'' after the fifth expansion.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that if we executed</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a> '((stage run)))</pre> 
 
 <p>then we could attack all theorems (involving <span class="v">run</span>) with staged 
 simplification (up to bound 100), without typing an explicit hint.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (run s 7) xxx))</pre> 
 
 <p>Using techniques similar to those above we have implemented ``priority 
 phased simplification'' and provided it as a book.  See community book 
 <span class="v">books/misc/priorities.lisp</span>.  This is an idea suggested by Pete Manolios, 
 by which priorities may be assigned to rules and then the simplifier 
 simplifies each subgoal maximally under the rules of a given priority before 
 enabling the rules of the next priority level.  The book above documents both 
 how we implement it with computed hints and how to use it.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is another example of using the <span class="v">stable-under-simplificationp</span> flag 
 to delay certain actions.  It defines a default hint, see <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-HINTS.html">default-hints</a>, which will enable <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a> on precisely 
 those goals which are stable-under-simplificationp.  It also uses the 
 <span class="v">HISTORY</span> and <span class="v">PSPV</span> variables to determine when toggling <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a> is appropriate.  These variables are documented only in 
 the source code.  If you start using these variables extensively, please 
 contact the developers of ACL2 or Robert Krug (<span class="v">rkrug@cs.utexas.edu</span>) and 
 let us know how we can help.</p>
