<p>The <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a> command is the main interface for using GL to prove 
theorems.  Here is the command we used in the bit-counting example from <a href="GL____1._02An_02Example_02GL_02Proof.html">1. An Example GL Proof</a>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a> fast-logcount-32-correct
  :hyp   (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 32 x)
  :concl (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (fast-logcount-32 x)
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGCOUNT.html">logcount</a> x))
  :g-bindings `((x ,(<a href="GL____G-INT.html">g-int</a> 0 1 33))))</pre> 
 
<p>Unlike an ordinary <a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> command, <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a> takes separate 
hypothesis and conclusion terms (its <span class="v">hyp</span> and <span class="v">:concl</span> arguments).  This 
separation allows GL to use the hypothesis to limit the scope of the symbolic 
execution it will perform.  You also have to provide GL with <span class="v">:g-bindings</span> 
that describe the symbolic objects to use for each free variable in the 
theorem.</p> 
 
<p>What are these bindings?  In the <span class="v">fast-logcount-32-correct</span> theorem, we 
used a convenient function, <span class="v">g-int</span>, to construct the <span class="v">:g-bindings</span>. 
Expanding this away, here are the actual bindings:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">((x (:g-integer 0 1 2 ... 32)))</pre> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">:g-bindings</span> argument uses a slight modification of the symbolic 
object format where the Boolean expressions are replaced by distinct natural 
numbers, each representing a Boolean variable.  In this case, our binding for 
<span class="v">x</span> stands for the following symbolic object:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">Xinit = (:g-integer b0 b1 ... b31 b32)</pre> 
 
<p>Note that <span class="v">Xinit</span> is not the same object as <span class="v">Xbest</span> from <a href="GL____4._02Proving_02Theorems_02by_02Symbolic_02Execution.html">4. Proving Theorems by Symbolic Execution</a>â€”its sign bit is <span class="v">b32</span> 
instead of <span class="v">false</span>, so <span class="v">Xinit</span> can represent any 33-bit signed integer 
whereas <span class="v">Xbest</span> only represents 32-bit unsigned values.  In fact, the 
<span class="v">:g-bindings</span> syntax does not even allow us to describe objects like 
<span class="v">Xbest</span>, which has the constant <span class="v">false</span> instead of a variable as one of 
its bits.</p> 
 
<p>There is a good reason for this restriction.  One of the steps in our proof 
strategy is to prove <b>coverage</b>: we need to show the symbolic objects we 
are starting out with have a sufficient range of values to cover all cases for 
which the hypothesis holds; more on this in <a href="GL____7._02Proving_02Coverage.html">7. Proving Coverage</a>.  The 
restricted syntax permitted by <span class="v">:g-bindings</span> ensures that the range of 
values represented by each symbolic object is easy to determine.  Because of 
this, coverage proofs are usually automatic.</p> 
 
<p>Despite these restrictions, GL will still end up using <span class="v">Xbest</span> to carry 
out the symbolic execution.  GL optimizes the original symbolic objects 
inferred from the <span class="v">:g-bindings</span> by using the hypothesis to reduce the space 
of objects that are represented.  In BDD mode this optimization uses <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/309847.309968" target="_blank"><nobr>BDD parametrization<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/309847.309968"></nobr></a>, which 
restricts the symbolic objects so they cover exactly the inputs recognized by 
the hypothesis.  In AIG mode we use a lighter-weight transformation that 
replaces variables with constants when the hypothesis sufficiently restricts 
them.  In this example, either optimization transforms <span class="v">Xinit</span> into 
<span class="v">Xbest</span>.</p>
