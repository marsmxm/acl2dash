<p>Add declarations for implicit wires.</p><p>Verilog allows wires to be implicitly declared in certain 
cases.</p> 
 
<p>Historically, VL added explicit declarations for these wires as part of the 
<a href="VL2014____LOADER.html">loader</a>, even before a proper <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-P.html">vl-module-p</a> structures were 
generated.  This allowed all transforms to expect that every wire should have a 
declaration.  It also allowed us to consider the order of module elements, 
without having to rely on some technique such as the <a href="VL2014____VL-LOCATION-P.html">vl-location-p</a>s 
associated with module elements, which could be unreliable if a module spans 
multiple files, e.g., because of includes.</p> 
 
<p>When we added support for SystemVerilog <span class="v">import</span> statements, we found 
this approach to be tricky.  In particular, to decide whether we need to add a 
declaration for some particular wire <span class="v">foo</span>, we now need to consider whether 
<span class="v">foo</span> is defined by any imported package.  For this, we really want to be 
able to inspect the whole <a href="VL2014____VL-DESIGN.html">vl-design</a> while making implicit wires.</p> 
 
<p>We therefore decided to split making implicit wires out of the parser and 
into a proper transform.  However, we generally expect to run this transform 
very early, perhaps even as the first step after parsing.  Normally this should 
be done as part of the <a href="VL2014____ANNOTATE.html">annotate</a> transform.</p> 
 
<p>Note that this transform is somewhat unique.  It is the only transform that 
considers the module elements in the order that they occur in the file.  It 
reads this information from the <span class="v">loaditems</span> field of the <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE.html">vl-module</a>. 
As part of this transform, the <span class="v">loaditems</span> field is <b>cleared</b>.  Other 
transforms should never use <span class="v">loaditems</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Implicit Wires in the Verilog-2005 Standard</h3> 
 
<p>When a wire is implicitly declared, its type is controlled by the 
<span class="v">`default_nettype</span> compiler directive (Section 19.2).  But VL's <a href="VL2014____PREPROCESSOR.html">preprocessor</a> does not yet support this directive and will cause an error if it 
is used, so for now we can safely assume any implicit wires should just have 
type <span class="v">wire</span>.  (We can probably add support <span class="v">default_nettype</span> without too 
much work, since our new approach of going through the module elements 
sequentially means that we have easy access to location information.)</p> 
 
<p>We think wires need to be declared, explicitly or implicitly, before being 
used.  The Verilog-2005 standard seems not to explicitly say whether or not 
this is the case, and the language at the start of Section 4.5 is somewhat 
vague: we are supposed to assume implicit nets <i>in the absence of an explicit 
declaration</i> in certain situations.  But later in 4.5 we find some language 
that pretty strongly suggests we are only to consider whether or not there is 
an explicit declaration <i>before</i> the use of the net: "<i>and that 
identifier has not been <b>declared previously</b> in the scope...</i>."</p> 
 
<p>Section 4.5 outlines the conditions under which an implicit wire declaration 
is supposed to be made.  In each case, the implicit declaration is to be added 
to the nearest scope, but it seems like this only matters in the case of 
<span class="v">generate</span> blocks, which we don't currently support.  (You might think that 
it would matter for functions, tasks, and named blocks as well, but it doesn't 
seem possible to use implicit wires in these contexts, see bullet #4 below for 
details).</p> 
 
<p>Note: I think that throughout Section 4.5, the words <i>port expression 
declaration</i> are a typo that should be <i>port declaration</i>; nowhere else 
in the Verilog-2005 standard do the words <i>port expression declaration</i> 
occur, at least according to Acrobat's find function.)</p> 
 
<h4>Case 1</h4> 
 
<p>If there is a port declaration like <span class="v">input [3:0] i;</span> that has no 
corresponding wire declaration, then we are supposed to infer an implicit net 
with the vector width of the "port expression declaration," which I think 
means the <span class="v">[3:0]</span> part.  This seems basically reasonable when you just read 
it, but there are a lot of subtle issues that arise; see #7 below for some 
experiments.</p> 
 
<p>Note that per 12.3.3, a port declaration like <span class="v">input wire [3:0] i;</span> is 
treated as both an input declaration and an explicit wire declaration.  We 
don't have to do anything special to handle this, because the parser 
automatically builds both a <a href="VL2014____VL-PORTDECL-P.html">vl-portdecl-p</a> and a <a href="VL2014____VL-VARDECL-P.html">vl-vardecl-p</a> for 
such declarations; see vl-parse-port-declaration-noatts.</p> 
 
<h4>Case 2</h4> 
 
<p>If there is an undeclared identifier in the terminal list of a primitive or 
module instance, or in the left-hand side of a continuous assignment statement, 
then we are supposed to infer an implicit, scalar net.</p> 
 
<p>I think a "primitive instance" is supposed to mean either a gate instance 
or a user-defined primitive instance.  See for instance Section 7.1.6, which 
talks about "primitive instance connection lists" in reference to gates, and 
11.6.6 where primitive terminals are distinguished from module ports.  So, this 
means we should infer implicit wires in the ports/terminals of any instance, 
regardless of whether it's a gate/udp/module.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Implicit Wires in Verilog Implementations</h3> 
 
<p>We developed some tests (see <span class="v">test/test-implicit.v</span>) to see how 
Verilog-XL and NCVerilog handle implicit wires.  Here are our findings.</p> 
 
<p><b>#1</b>.  As expected, both allow implicit wires to be inferred from the 
arguments of gate and module instances.  This seems to be the intent of Case 
2.</p> 
 
<p><b>#2</b>.  As expected, both complain about undeclared wires on the 
right-hand side of an <span class="v">assign</span> statement.  This seems to agree with Case 
2.</p> 
 
<p><b>#3</b>.  As expected, NCVerilog allows us to infer implicit nets from the 
left-hand sides of <span class="v">assign</span> elements.  Unfortunately, Verilog-XL complains 
about such wires, which seems to contradict the Verilog-2005 standard.  As a 
compromise, our approach is to mimick NCVerilog and infer the implicit net, but 
warn that some other tools like Verilog-XL may not allow the construct.</p> 
 
<p>A subtle case is, what if #2 and #3 overlap, i.e., an undeclared wire occurs 
on both the left-hand and right-hand sides?  NCVerilog seems to process the 
left-hand side first, and hence it allows us to infer an implicit wire for 
<span class="v">w</span> when we give it an assignment like <span class="v">assign w = w</span>.  This isn't 
entirely contrived; someone might occasionally write things like <span class="v">assign {a,
abar} = {foo, ~a}</span>.</p> 
 
<p><b>#4</b>.  Mostly as expected, neither tool allows undeclared wires on 
either side of an assignment in an always block.  The tools even reject 
implicit wires in procedural continuous assignments, e.g., <span class="v">always @(b)
assign w = a;</span>.  But this seems arguably incorrect: is not a procedural 
continuous assignment also a continuous assignment, whose LHS should therefore 
be able to contain implicit wires?</p> 
 
<p>We mimick these tools and disallow the implicit net, even thought the spec 
might perhaps be interpreted as allowing it, because it allows us to avoid 
certain scoping issues.  In particular, suppose we see a procedural continuous 
assignment statement, <span class="v">assign w = ...</span>, where <span class="v">w</span> is not declared.  If 
this statement occurs in a task or a named block within an initial/always 
statement, should the declaration for <span class="v">w</span> be added to the module or to this 
more local scope?  I'm not sure.  So, the good thing about not inferring 
implicit nets for these assignments is that I don't have to be able to answer 
the question, because I'm not going to infer a net anyway.</p> 
 
<p><b>#5</b>.  As expected, neither implementation tolerates undeclared wires 
on either side of assignments in function bodies.  This seems perfectly 
reasonable since functions aren't allowed to have procedural continuous 
assignments (10.4.4 E).</p> 
 
<p><b>#6</b> As expected, both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog require that all wires 
be declared (either explicitly or implicitly) before they are used.  For 
instance, they if <span class="v">a</span> is declared but <span class="v">w</span> is not, then they reject code 
fragments such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign a = w;   // error here, saying w is undeclared
wire w;</pre> 
 
<p>And also for code like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">not(a, w);
wire w;         // error here, saying w is implicitly declared above</pre> 
 
 
<p><b>#7</b> The whole declare-before-use thing is pretty strange for ports. 
Suppose <span class="v">c</span> is a port of the module.  Then, both NCVerilog and Verilog-XL 
will complain if you try to write:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire c2 = c;    // error here, saying c is not declared.
input c;</pre> 
 
<p>Verilog-XL seems to require the port declaration to come before the wire 
declaration, if any.  That is, it considers the following an error, whereas 
NCVerilog allows it:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire c;
input c;</pre> 
 
<p>This seems to hold for implicit declarations, too.  For instance, Verilog-XL 
rejects the following, but NCVerilog allows it:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">buf(c, c2);     // implicit declaration of wire c here
input c;</pre> 
 
<p>But both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog allow the following, even though you might 
think the buf gate would introduce an implicit declaration of <span class="v">c</span> that would 
conflict with the explicit declaration.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">input c;
buf(c, c2);
wire c;</pre> 
 
<p>We try to be permissive and mimick NCVerilog, but add a (non-fatal) warning 
if a wire's net declaration comes before its port declaration to explain that 
some other tools do not permit this.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Other Notes</h3> 
 
<p>In previous versions of VL, we allowed declarations to come in any order, 
and inferred an implicit wire whenever a wire was used in a context that 
permitted it.  We now try to be more faithful to other Verilog systems and 
require that wires be declared before their first uses, since this seems like 
the right way to interpret the Verilog-2005 standard.</p> 
 
<p>With regard to Case 1, we add a net declaration for each port declaration 
that is missing a corresponding wire declaration.  In the process, we make sure 
that at least some declaration (be it a wire or port declaration) of each port 
occurs before every use of the port.  If only a wire declaration occurs before 
some use of the port wire, we issue a non-fatal warning saying that Verilog-XL 
does not tolerate this ordering.</p> 
 
<p>When we add implicit wires for ports, we use the range of the port 
declaration, which seems to be correct with respect to the "vector width of 
the port declaration expression," described above.  We also keep the 
signedness of the port, which isn't discussed above, but appears to be the 
correct thing to do; see <a href="VL2014____PORTDECL-SIGN.html">portdecl-sign</a> for details.  We place the 
implicit wire declaration at the same location as the corresponding port 
declaration, which seems like the easiest place to put it.  We also mark each 
implicit wire declaration with the <span class="v">VL_PORT_IMPLICIT</span> attribute.  This 
attribute is used by the <a href="VL2014____PRINTER.html">printer</a> to avoid printing any net declarations 
that were implicit.</p> 
 
<p>With regard to Case 2, we add one-bit wire declarations for any undeclared 
wires that occur within the port arguments of gate and module instances, and 
which occur in the left-hand sides of continuous assignments.  For assignments, 
we always issue a non-fatal warning that says Verilog-XL doesn't add implicit 
nets here, and we always process the left-hand side first (like NCVerilog).  We 
add the wire declarations at the locations in which they are implicitly 
declared, and mark them with the <span class="v">VL_IMPLICIT</span> attribute, which is useful in 
<a href="VL2014____TYPO-DETECTION.html">typo-detection</a>.</p>
