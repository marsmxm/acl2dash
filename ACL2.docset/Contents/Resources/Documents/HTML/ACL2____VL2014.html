<p>The VL Verilog Toolkit, 2014 Edition.  This is a "stable" fork of 
<a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> for compatibility with <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>.</p><h3>What are VL and VL2014?</h3> 
 
<p>The <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> Verilog Toolkit is a large ACL2 library for working with 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog" target="_blank"><nobr>Verilog<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verilog"></nobr></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog" target="_blank"><nobr>SystemVerilog<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SystemVerilog"></nobr></a> source 
code, developed at Centaur Technology by Jared Davis and Sol Swords.</p> 
 
<p>The <u>2014 Edition</u> of VL is a "stable" fork of VL that is meant to 
provide continuing support for older tools, notably including <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>, and also including other internal Centaur tools that are based on 
earlier versions of VL.</p> 
 
<p>The 2014 Edition is <b>not</b> under active development.  You should 
probably not use it for new projects, and it may be best to work toward 
eventually transitioning older tools away from it, in favor of the "main" 
version of <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Note that you can tell which version of VL you are using as follows.</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Main Edition: <span class="v">centaur/vl</span> directory, <span class="v">vl</span> package.</li> 
<li>2014 Edition: <span class="v">centaur/vl2014</span> directory, <span class="v">vl2014</span> package.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Since each version uses its own package, it is possible to load both 
versions into the same ACL2 project simultaneously.  This may be of use when 
transitioning code from the 2014 Edition to the main edition.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Why is there a 2014 Edition?</h3> 
 
<p>VL has a long history.  Its development started in 2008.  At that time, our 
goal was only to implement support for Verilog-2005.  Over the next several 
years, we used VL to implement many tools, many of which were based around 
<a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>.  ESIM is a purely bit-level backend.</p> 
 
<p>In 2014, we began extending VL with features from SystemVerilog and also 
began work on a new, vector-level backend, <a href="ACL2____SV.html">sv</a>.  Throughout 2014, 
and into the start of 2015, we made substantial changes to VL and transitioned 
our internal projects to SV.</p> 
 
<p>Much of this work was compatible with ESIM and expanded what the VL/ESIM 
flow could handle.  For instance: during this time, the ESIM flow gained better 
support for ANSI-style ports, SystemVerilog style global parameters, basic 
SystemVerilog idioms like <span class="v">always_comb</span> and <span class="v">logic</span> data types, and so 
on.  Other certain SystemVerilog features (structs, arrays, etc.) would have 
been difficult to support in ESIM, so we only added them to the VL/SV flow.</p> 
 
<p>In February 2015, we began working on a substantial change to VL's 
expression representation.  It became apparent that supporting ESIM through 
this change would require updating a large body of code.  This would be a major 
cost to maintain code that we were no longer using.</p> 
 
<p>In light of this, we decided that it was time to end support for the ESIM 
flow in VL, but we did not want to abandon ESIM altogether.  As a compromise, 
we decided to create a stable fork of VL, based on the last version of VL that 
works with ESIM.  This fork would allow older tools and proofs to continue to 
function, while giving us the freedom to move more quickly on the new versions 
of VL without having to continually update the ESIM flow.</p>
