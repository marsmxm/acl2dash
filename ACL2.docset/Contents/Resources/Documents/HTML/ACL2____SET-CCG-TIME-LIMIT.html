<p>Set a global time limit for CCG-based termination proofs.</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CCG-TIME-LIMIT.html">set-ccg-time-limit</a> 120)  ; limits termination proofs to 120 seconds.
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CCG-TIME-LIMIT.html">set-ccg-time-limit</a> 53/2) ; limits termination proofs to 53/2 seconds.
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CCG-TIME-LIMIT.html">set-ccg-time-limit</a> nil)  ; removes any time limit for termination proofs.</pre> 
 
 <p>Introduced by the CCG analysis book, this macro sets a global time limit 
 for the completion of the CCG analysis. The time limit is given as a rational 
 number, signifying the number of seconds to which the CCG analysis should be 
 limited, or nil, signifying that there should be no such time limit. If CCG 
 has not completed its attempt to prove termination in the number of seconds 
 specified, it will immediately throw an error and the definition attempt will 
 fail. Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event summary but 
 nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"> General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CCG-TIME-LIMIT.html">set-ccg-time-limit</a> tl)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">tl</span> is a positive rational number or nil. The default is nil. If 
 the time limit is nil, the CCG analysis will work as long as it needs to in 
 order to complete the analysis. If the <span class="v">tl</span> is a positive rational number, 
 all CCG analyses will be limited to <span class="v">tl</span> seconds.</p>
