<p>ACL2 Version  2.8 Notes on Miscellaneous Changes</p><p>Execution of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span> events has been sped up in many cases by 
 avoiding excessive consing.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 now warns if <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> (or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>) rules 
 contain free variables on the right-hand side.  Thanks to Dave Greve for 
 raising this issue.</p> 
 
 <p>Emacs file <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> has been updated to better comprehend 
 the notion of the ``ACL2 shell'', which is the buffer to which ACL2 forms are 
 written by commands defined in the above file.  Thus, command <span class="v">control-t e</span> 
 has been modified always to write to the ACL2 shell (which is <span class="v">"*shell*"</span> 
 by default), and the following new commands have been defined.</p> 
 
 <blockquote><p>o control-t c<br> 
 
   Set the ACL2 shell to the current buffer. 
 o control-t b<br> 
 
   Change to the ACL2 shell.</p></blockquote> 
 
 <p>The commands <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span> may now be given a macro 
 name that corresponds via the <span class="v">macro-aliases-table</span> to a function name, so 
 that for example <span class="v">:pl append</span> is treated the same as <span class="v">:pl
 binary-append</span>.  A more interesting improvement, for <span class="v">:pl</span> only, is that 
 <span class="v">:pl</span> may now take any term.  When <span class="v">:pl</span> is given a term other than a 
 symbol, it will print all rewrite rules that match that term.  Thanks to David 
 Russinoff, Robert Krug, and Bill Legato for getting this going.</p> 
 
 <p>A new function, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PKG-WITNESS.html">pkg-witness</a></span>, returns a symbol in the given 
 package.</p> 
 
 <p>The installation instructions have been updated, for example to give more 
 guidance on obtaining Lisp implementations and to mention the acl2-help 
 mailing list.</p> 
 
 <p>Jared Davis has suggested some symbols to be added to <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>, 
 and we have done so.  Thanks, Jared.</p> 
 
 <blockquote><p>o <span class="v">MFC</span> (used in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a></span>; thanks also to Robert Krug for this one) o <span class="v">ID</span>, 
 <span class="v">CLAUSE</span>, <span class="v">WORLD</span>, and <span class="v">STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP</span> (used in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a></span>) o <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-HINTS.html">set-default-hints</a></span></p></blockquote> 
 
 <p>The command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> has been improved so that when the event is 
 inside an included book, the path of included books (from the top-level book 
 down to the one containing the event) is shown.  Thanks to Eric Smith (perhaps 
 among others) for pointing out the utility of this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>A new release of the rtl library has been included: <span class="v">books/rtl/rel4/</span>. 
 See the <span class="v">README</span> file in that directory.</p>
