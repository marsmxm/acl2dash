<p>When a <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> is used in a proof, 
     proof subgoals are created to ensure that the replacing functions 
     satisfy all the constraints of the replaced functions. 
     In a <span class="v">:functional-instance</span> with a function substitution <span class="v">S</span> 
     as calculated by <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____EXT-FUN-SUBST-TERM_F2TERMS_F2FUNCTION.html">ext-fun-subst-term/terms/function</a></span>, 
     each function variable (which comes from the instantiation) 
     has no constraints and so no subgoals are generated for them. 
     Each second-order function <span class="v">sofun</span> in <span class="v">S</span> 
     has the following constraints:</p><ul>
<li>If <span class="v">sofun</span> is a plain second-order function, 
      the constraint is that 
      the application of <span class="v">S</span> to the definition of <span class="v">sofun</span> is a theorem, 
      which follows by the construction of the instance <span class="v">fun</span> of <span class="v">sofun</span>, 
      i.e. it follows from the definition of <span class="v">fun</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="v">sofun</span> is a choice second-order function, 
      the constraint is that 
      the application of <span class="v">S</span> to the choice axiom of <span class="v">sofun</span> is a theorem, 
      which follows by the construction of the instance <span class="v">fun</span> of <span class="v">sofun</span>, 
      i.e. it follows from the choice axiom of <span class="v">fun</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="v">sofun</span> is a quantifier second-order function, 
      the constraints are that 
      (1) the application of <span class="v">S</span> 
      to the rewrite rule generated by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> of <span class="v">sofun</span>, 
      and (2) the application of <span class="v">S</span> to the definition of <span class="v">sofun</span> 
      (or to the defining theorem of <span class="v">sofun</span> 
      if <span class="v">sofun</span> was introduced with <span class="v">:constrain t</span>), 
      are both theorems, 
      which both follow by the construction 
      of the instance <span class="v">fun</span> of <span class="v">sofun</span>, 
      i.e. they follow from 
      (1) the rewrite rule generated by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> of <span class="v">fun</span> 
      and (2) the definition of <span class="v">fun</span> 
      (or the defining theorem of <span class="v">fun</span> 
      if <span class="v">fun</span> was introduced with <span class="v">:constrain nil</span>).</li>
</ul><p>The list of facts needed to prove these constraints is determined 
     by the function substitution <span class="v">S</span>. 
     For each pair <span class="v">(fun1 . fun2)</span> of the function substitution:</p><ul>
<li>If <span class="v">fun1</span> is a plain second-order function, 
      the fact used in the proof is the definition of <span class="v">fun2</span>, 
      whose name is the name of <span class="v">fun2</span>. 
      (Note that by construction, since <span class="v">fun2</span> is an instance of <span class="v">fun1</span>, 
      <span class="v">fun2</span> is introduced by a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.)</li>
<li>If <span class="v">fun1</span> is a choice second-order function, 
      the fact used in the proof is the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> axiom of <span class="v">fun2</span>, 
      whose name is the name of <span class="v">fun2</span>. 
      (Note that by construction, since <span class="v">fun2</span> is an instance of <span class="v">fun1</span>, 
      <span class="v">fun2</span> is introduced by a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span>.)</li>
<li>If <span class="v">fun1</span> is a quantifier second-order function, 
      the facts used in the proof are 
      (1) the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> rewrite rule of <span class="v">fun2</span> 
      and (2) 
      either (i) the definition of <span class="v">fun2</span> 
      (if <span class="v">fun2</span> was introduced with <span class="v">:constrain nil</span>), 
      whose name is the name of <span class="v">fun2</span>, 
      or (ii) the defining theorem of <span class="v">fun2</span> 
      (if <span class="v">fun2</span> was introduced with <span class="v">:constrain t</span>), 
      whose name is <span class="v">fun2</span> followed by <span class="v">-definition</span>. 
      (Note that by construction, since <span class="v">fun2</span> is an instance of <span class="v">fun1</span>, 
      <span class="v">fun2</span> is introduced by a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span>.)</li>
<li>Otherwise, <span class="v">fun1</span> is a function variable, which has no constraints, 
      so no fact is used in the proof.</li>
