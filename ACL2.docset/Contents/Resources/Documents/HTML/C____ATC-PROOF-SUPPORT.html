<p>Functions and rules to support the proofs generated by ATC.</p><p>Currently, the generated proofs of function correctness 
     are carried out via symbolic execution of the C code. 
     The C code is a constant value, 
     because we are generating proofs over specific C functions; 
     this makes symbolic execution possible.</p><p>In order to make these generated proofs more robust, 
     we carry them out in a theory that consists exactly of 
     (what we believe to be) all and only the needed rules. 
     This file defines that theory, which consists of 
     some rules introduced elsewhere and some rules introduced in this file. 
     This set of rules has been defined by 
     not only thinking of what is needed for symbolic execution, 
     but also experimenting with several symbolic execution proofs, 
     starting with the empty theory and adding rules 
     as needed to advance the symbolic execution, 
     and also by looking at the C dynamic semantics. 
     There is no guarantee (meta proof) that 
     these rules will suffice for every use of ATC; 
     there is also no guarantee that 
     the proof will not be defeated by some ACL2 heuristic in some cases. 
     Nonetheless, the proof strategy seems sound and robust, 
     and if a generated proof fails 
     it should be possible to (prove and) use additional rules.</p><p>Besides rules, we also introduce some functions 
     that provide a canonical representation of computation states 
     that is used during symbolic execution. 
     Thus, some of the rules in the symbolic execution theory 
     are tailored to the functions that form this canonical representation.</p>
