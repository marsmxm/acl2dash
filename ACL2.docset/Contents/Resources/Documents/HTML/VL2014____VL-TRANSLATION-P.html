<p>The result of translating a Verilog or SystemVerilog design.</p><p><span class="tt">(vl-translation-p x)</span> is a <a href="STD____DEFAGGREGATE.html">defaggregate</a> of the following fields.</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="tt">good</span> — Fully translated modules, etc., for whatever subset of the 
                   overall design we were able to successfully translate. 
                   This is the "good subset" of the design.<br>    <font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-DESIGN-P.html">vl-design-p</a> good)</span>.</font>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">bad</span> — Partially translated modules, etc., that, for whatever 
                   reason, we were unable to successfully translate.  The 
                   modules here will typically have fatal warnings.  This This 
                   is the "bad subset" or at least the "unsupported subset" 
                   of the design.<br>    <font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-DESIGN-P.html">vl-design-p</a> bad)</span>.</font>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">orig</span> — The raw, unsimplified design that we obtained immediately 
                   after parsing.  This can be useful for pretty-printing and 
                   understanding modules.<br>    <font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-DESIGN-P.html">vl-design-p</a> orig)</span>.</font>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">filemap</span> — The actual Verilog source code that was read. Occasionally 
                   this is useful for understanding warnings that refer to 
                   particular file locations.<br>    <font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-FILEMAP-P.html">vl-filemap-p</a> filemap)</span>.</font>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">defines</span> — Records all of the <span class="v">`define</span> directives that were 
                   encountered during parsing, and their final values. This is 
                   sometimes useful for extracting definitions like opcodes, 
                   etc.<br>    <font color="#606060">Invariant <span class="v">(<a href="VL2014____VL-DEFINES-P.html">vl-defines-p</a> defines)</span>.</font>
