<p>Overview of FTY support for pseudo-terms.</p><p>The book "clause-processors/pseudo-term-fty" defines a fixing 
function and convenient accessors and constructors for <a href="ACL2____FTY-DISCIPLINE.html">fty-discipline</a> support for pseudo-terms.  It also provides macros that 
generate appropriate theorems about evaluators allowing them to understand the 
new accessors and constructors.</p> 
 
<h3>Usage</h3> 
<p>We treat the pseudo-term type as a sum of five kinds of products:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">:null</span>, encompassing the unique pseudo-term <span class="v">NIL</span> as well as 
 (ill-formed) non-symbol atoms and calls with non-symbol atom function names; 
has no field</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:var</span>, encompassing non-nil symbols; field: <span class="v">name</span>
</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:quote</span>, conses whose car is <span class="v">quote</span>; field: <span class="v">val</span>
</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">fncall</span>, conses whose car is a non-quote symbol; fields: <span class="v">fn</span> and <span class="v">args</span>
</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">lambda</span>, conses whose car is a cons; fields: <span class="v">formals</span>, <span class="v">body</span>, and <span class="v">args</span>.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Each of these product kinds has a constructor that uses the typical naming 
convention; e.g., to make a lambda, use <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-LAMBDA.html">pseudo-term-lambda</a> formals body
args)</span>.  The accessors also use the usual naming convention (e.g., 
<span class="v">pseudo-term-var-&gt;name</span>).  There is also a <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> binder for each such 
constructor that allows access to the fields using dotted notation; e.g.:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> (((<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-LAMBDA.html">pseudo-lambda</a> x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x.formals x.body x.args))</pre> 
 
<p>An alternative constructor <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-CALL.html">pseudo-term-call</a> fn args)</span> can create either 
<span class="v">:fncall</span> or <span class="v">:lambda</span> kinds; its <span class="v">fn</span> argument is of type <a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-FN.html">pseudo-fn</a> which can be either a function symbol (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-FNSYM.html">pseudo-fnsym</a>) or 
lambda (<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-LAMBDA.html">pseudo-lambda</a>).  The function of a <span class="v">:fncall</span> or 
<span class="v">:lambda</span> object can also be accessed with <span class="v">pseudo-term-call-&gt;fn</span>.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">:null</span> and <span class="v">:quote</span> kinds both simply have constant values.  A 
function <span class="v">pseudo-term-const-&gt;val</span> is provided that accesses that value; that 
is, it returns the value of a <span class="v">:quote</span> object or NIL for a <span class="v">:null</span> 
object.  We don't provide a constructor <span class="v">pseudo-term-const</span> since 
<span class="v">pseudo-term-quote</span> will do just as well.</p> 
 
<p>The macro <a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-CASE.html">pseudo-term-case</a> can be used to conveniently branch on the kind 
of term and access the fields; see its documentation for examples.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Evaluator support</h3> 
 
<p>The macro <a href="ACL2____DEF-EV-PSEUDO-TERM-FTY-SUPPORT.html">def-ev-pseudo-term-fty-support</a> admits several theorems about an evaluator, enabling reasoning about evaluation over the provided constructors and accessors.  See its documentation for details.</p> 
 
<p>Another macro, <a href="ACL2____DEF-EV-PSEUDO-TERM-CONGRUENCE.html">def-ev-pseudo-term-congruence</a>, admits only a subset of the theorems produced by <a href="ACL2____DEF-EV-PSEUDO-TERM-FTY-SUPPORT.html">def-ev-pseudo-term-fty-support</a>, proving a pseudo-term-equiv congruence for the evaluator but no rules pertaining to the FTY-style accessors and updaters.</p>
