<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2-PC____FORWARDCHAIN">Click for ACL2-pc::forwardchain in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>(atomic macro) 
forward chain from an implication in the hyps</p><pre class="code">Example:
(forwardchain 2) ; Second hypothesis should be of the form
                 ; (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> hyp concl), and the result is to replace
                 ; that hypothesis with concl.

General Forms:
(forwardchain hypothesis-number)
(forwardchain hypothesis-number hints)
(forwardchain hypothesis-number hints quiet-flg)</pre> 
 
 <p>This command replaces the hypothesis corresponding to given index, which 
 should be of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> hyp concl)</span>, with its consequent 
 <span class="v">concl</span>.  In fact, the given hypothesis is dropped, and the replacement 
 hypothesis will appear as the final hypothesis after this command is 
 executed.</p> 
 
 <p>The prover must be able to prove the indicated hypothesis from the other 
 hypotheses, or else the command will fail.  The <span class="v">:hints</span> argument is used 
 in this prover call, and should have the usual syntax of hints to the 
 prover.</p> 
 
 <p>Output is suppressed if <span class="v">quiet-flg</span> is supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>.</p>
