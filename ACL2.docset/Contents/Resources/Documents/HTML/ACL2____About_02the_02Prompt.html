<p>About the Prompt</p><p>The string ``<span class="v">ACL2 !&gt;</span>'' is the ACL2 prompt.</p> 
 
 <p>The prompt tells the user that an ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> is expected.  In addition, the prompt 
 tells us a little about the current state of the ACL2 command interpreter.  We 
 explain the prompt briefly below.  But first we talk about the command 
 interpreter.</p> 
 
 <p>An ACL2 command is generally a Lisp expression to be evaluated.  There are 
 some unusual commands (such as <span class="v">:</span><a href="ACL2____Q.html">q</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> for 
 <b>quitting</b> ACL2) which cause other behavior.  But most commands are read, 
 evaluated, and then have their results printed.  Thus, we call the command 
 interpreter a ``read-eval-print loop.''  The ACL2 command interpreter is named 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> (after Lisp's ``load'').</p> 
 
 <p>When a command is read, all the symbols in it are converted to uppercase. 
 Thus, typing <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> app ...)</span> is the same as typing <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">DEFUN</a> APP ...)</span> 
 or <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> App ...)</span>.  There are ways to force lowercase case characters 
 into symbols but we won't discuss them here.  A consequence of Common Lisp's 
 default uppercasing is that you'll see a general lack of concern over the case 
 used when symbols are displayed in this documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>In addition, symbols ``belong'' to ``packages'' which give the user a way 
 to control namespaces.  The prompt tells us which package is the default one, 
 namely <span class="v">"ACL2"</span>.  That means when we call <span class="v">car</span>, for example, we are 
 invoking the standard definition of that symbol.  If the packager were 
 <span class="v">"JONES"</span> then <span class="v">car</span> would refer to the definition of that symbol in 
 that package (which may or may not be different depending on what symbols were 
 imported into that package.</p> 
 
 <p>A command like <b>(defun app (x y) ...)</b> causes ACL2 to evaluate the 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> function on <b>app</b>, <b>(x y)</b> and 
 <b>...</b>.  When that command is evaluated it prints some information to the 
 terminal explaining the processing of the proposed definition.  It returns the 
 symbol <span class="v">APP</span> as its value, which is printed by the command interpreter. 
 (Actually, <span class="v">defun</span> is not a function but a <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">macro</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> which expands to a form that involves <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> 
 <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>, a necessary precondition to printing output to the 
 terminal and to ``changing'' the set of axioms.  But we do not discuss this 
 further here.)</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">defun</span> command is an example of a special kind of command called an 
 ``event.''  <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">Events</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> are those commands that change the ``logical 
 world'' by adding such things as axioms or theorems to ACL2's database.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.  But not every command is an event command.</p> 
 
 <p>A command like <b>(app '(1 2 3) '(4 5 6 7))</b> is an example of a 
 non-event.  It is processed the same general way: the function <b>app</b> is 
 applied to the indicated arguments and the result is printed.  The function 
 <b>app</b> does not print anything and does not change the ``world.''</p> 
 
 <p>A third kind of command is one that display information about the current 
 logical world or that ``roll back'' to previous versions of the world.  Such 
 commands are called ``<a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a>'' <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 commands.</p> 
 
 <p>What does the ACL2 prompt tell us about the read-eval-print loop?  The 
 prompt ``<span class="v">ACL2 !&gt;</span>'' tells us that the command will be read with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-PACKAGE.html">current-package</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> set to <span class="v">"ACL2"</span>, that guard checking (see 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>) is on (``<span class="v">!</span>''), and that we are at the 
 top-level (there is only one ``<span class="v">&gt;</span>'').  For more about the prompt, see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-PRINT-PROMPT.html">default-print-prompt</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.</p>
