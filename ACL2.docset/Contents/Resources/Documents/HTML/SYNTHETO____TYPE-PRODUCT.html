<p>Fixtype of Syntheto type products.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>fields — <a href="SYNTHETO____FIELD-LIST.html">field-list</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>invariant — <a href="SYNTHETO____MAYBE-EXPRESSION.html">maybe-expression</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>This is like a cartesian product of types, 
     where each factor has a name, 
     so it is in fact a list of type fields. 
     In addition, there is an optional invariant expression, 
     which, if present, must be boolean-valued 
     and must have the field names as its only variables. 
     The idea is that 
     only the combinations of fields that satisfy the expression 
     are part of the type. 
     When the expression is absent, all combinations are part of the type.</p>
