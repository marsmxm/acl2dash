<p>Suppressing or turning on specified output for an event</p><p>The macro <span class="v">with-output</span> can be used to control ACL2 output.  It 
 can be wrapped around an event to create a new event; see <a href="ACL2____EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>.  The macro <span class="v">with-output!</span> is identical except that 
 it does not create an event and, unlike <span class="v">with-output</span>, it can be called in 
 code.</p> 
 
 <h3>Examples</h3>

 <h3>General Form</h3> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> :key1 val1 ... :keyk valk form)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">form</span> should evaluate to an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>.  That evaluation 
 takes place with output that is according to the values <span class="v">vali</span> of the 
 keywords, <span class="v">:keyi</span>, as described below.  When the scope of <span class="v">with-output</span> 
 is exited, then all modifications are undone, including the states of output 
 and summary inhibition, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a></span>, and <a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a>s.  Each 
 keyword may occur at most once.</p> 
 
 <h3>On-off specs</h3> 
 
 <p>Before discussing the keywords we introduce the notion of ``on-off specs'', 
 which are the legal values of the keywords <span class="v">:on</span>, <span class="v">:off</span>,, 
 <span class="v">:summary-on</span>, and <span class="v">:summary-off</span>.  An on-off spec has one of the 
 following forms, where each <span class="v">symi</span> is a symbol, and subject to restrictions 
 discussed below</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li><span class="v">:all</span></li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">sym</span> ; a symbol that is not <span class="v">:all</span>
</li> 
 
 <li><span class="v">(sym1 ... symk)</span></li> 
 
 <li><span class="v">(:other-than sym1 ... symk)</span></li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The set of ``associated valid symbols'' is defined as follows.  For 
 <span class="v">:off</span> or <span class="v">:on</span>, these symbols are the <i>output types</i> that can be 
 inhibited (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>), that is, members of the list 
 stored in the constant <span class="v">*valid-output-names*</span>, the list 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> error
            warning! warning observation prove event
            summary proof-builder comment history)</span>.  Similarly, for <span class="v">:summary-on</span> or 
 <span class="v">:summary-off</span>, these are the <i>summary types</i>: the parts of the <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> that can be inhibited (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBITED-SUMMARY-TYPES.html">set-inhibited-summary-types</a>), that 
 is, members of the list stored in the constant <span class="v">*summary-types*</span>, the list 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ERRORS.html">errors</a> form header hint-events
        redundant rules splitter-rules steps
        system-attachments time value warnings)</span>.  An on-off spec consisting of associated valid symbols, 
 <span class="v">(sym1 ... symk)</span>, indicates the set of symbols, <span class="v">{sym1,...,symk}</span>.  The 
 other legal forms of on-off spec and their meanings are as follows: <span class="v">:all</span> 
 represents the set of all associated valid symbols, any other symbol <span class="v">sym</span> 
 abbreviates <span class="v">(sym)</span>, and <span class="v">(:other-than sym1 ... symk)</span> represents the 
 set of associated valid symbols that are not in the list <span class="v">(sym1
 ... symk)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that these two notions of ``associated valid symbols'' — the 
 <i>output types</i> controlled by keywords <span class="v">:on</span> and <span class="v">:off</span>, and the 
 <i>summary types</i> contolled by keywords <span class="v">:summary-on</span> and 
 <span class="v">:summary-off</span> — operate independently in the following sense.  The 
 keywords <span class="v">:on</span> and <span class="v">:off</span> control output types from the list 
 <span class="v">*valid-output-names*</span> displayed above, one of whose members is 
 <span class="v">SUMMARY</span>.  The keywords <span class="v">:summary-on</span> and <span class="v">:summary-off</span> control 
 summary types from the list <span class="v">*summary-types*</span> displayed above, indicating 
 which types of summary are to be printed in the case that <span class="v">SUMMARY</span> is 
 among the output types that are on.  This summary control persists even as the 
 <span class="v">SUMMARY</span> type changes state between off and on.  Consider the following 
 example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> :off (<a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>)
 (<a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> :summary-off (time)
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> :on (<a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>)
   (<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> y)))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The resulting output does not include <span class="v">TIME</span> output in the summary.  The 
 reason is that the second <span class="v">with-output</span> form specifies that <span class="v">TIME</span> 
 summary output is off; then when the third (innermost) output turns 
 <span class="v">SUMMARY</span> output on, still, the <span class="v">TIME</span> summary output is off, so the 
 <span class="v">THM</span> call does not print the <span class="v">TIME</span> part of the summary output.  Note 
 that the same reasoning applies if the third <span class="v">with-output</span> call above 
 specifies <span class="v">:on :all</span> instead of <span class="v">:on (<a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>)</span>; that case also produces 
 no time output in the summary.  That is, the use of <span class="v">:on :all</span> specifies 
 which output types are on, but does not affect which summary types are on; 
 again, output types and summary types are controlled independently by the 
 respective pairs <span class="v">:on/:off</span> and <span class="v">:summary-on/:summary-off</span>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Keyword arguments</h3> 
 
 <p>We turn now to a discussion of the keyword arguments.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:on</span>, <span class="v">:off</span></p> 
 
 <p>The values for these keywords, which are not evaluated, must be on-off 
 specs for these keywords (as discussed above).  If <span class="v">:on :all</span> is specified, 
 then then every output type is turned on except for those in the set specified 
 by the value of <span class="v">:off</span>.  Otherwise, if <span class="v">:off :all</span> is specified, then 
 every output type is inhibited except as specified by the the value of 
 <span class="v">:on</span>.  Otherwise <span class="v">:all</span> is not specified for either <span class="v">:on</span> or 
 <span class="v">:off</span>, and the currently-inhibited output types are reduced as specified 
 by the value of <span class="v">:on</span> and then extended as specified by the value of 
 <span class="v">:off</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:summary-on</span>, <span class="v">:summary-off</span></p> 
 
 <p>The values for these keywords, which are not evaluated, must be on-off 
 specs for these keywords.  They are interpreted exactly as are the values for 
 <span class="v">:on</span> and <span class="v">:off</span> as described above, except that instead of output types 
 they are interpreted with respect to the summary types (i.e., in the 
 terminology introduced above, with respect to the set of associated valid 
 symbols for <span class="v">:summary-on</span> and <span class="v">:summary-off</span>).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:gag-mode</span></p> 
 
 <p>The value should evaluate to one of the legal values for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a></span>.  The effect is as though <span class="v">set-gag-mode</span> has been called with 
 this argument, before modifying how output is inhibited, at the start of 
 evaluating the given form.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:evisc</span></p> 
 
 <p>The value should evaluate to a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-VALUE-LISTP.html">keyword-value-listp</a></span>, where each key 
 is a legal keyword for the <span class="v">:sites</span> keyword argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-evisc-tuple</a></span> other than <span class="v">:trace</span> and <span class="v">:brr</span> (that is, a member of 
 the list <span class="v">(:term :ld :abbrev :gag-mode)</span>), and 
 each value evaluates to a legal <a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a> for that keyword.  The 
 effect is as though <span class="v">set-evisc-tuple</span> has been called, before modifying how 
 output is inhibited, with this argument at the start of evaluating the given 
 form.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:ctx</span></p> 
 
 <p>The value should evaluate to a context — see <a href="ACL2____CTX.html">ctx</a> — that 
 will generally be used throughout evaluation of the given form, in place of 
 the usual event context (including the <span class="v">"Form"</span> field of the <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:stack</span></p> 
 
 <p>The value, which is not evaluated, must be <span class="v">:push</span> or <span class="v">:pop</span>.  The 
 effect of <span class="v">:push</span> is essentially to create a new environment for inferior 
 calls of <span class="v">with-output</span> that can be reverted (popped) by inferior calls of 
 <span class="v">with-output</span>, as discussed in the next section.  Note that the handling of 
 the <span class="v">:stack</span> argument pays no attention to the <span class="v">:summary-on</span> or 
 <span class="v">:summary-off</span> arguments.</p> 
 
 <h3>More about the <span class="v">stack</span> argument</h3> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:stack</span> keyword's effect is illustrated by the following example, 
 where ``<span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> nil)</span>'' may replaced by ``<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span>'' without any 
 change to the output that is printed.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a>
 :stack :push :off :all
 (<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> ()
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f1 (x) x)
   (<a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> :stack :pop (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f2 (x) x))
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f3 (x) x)
   (<a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> :stack :pop :off warning (<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> nil))
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f4 (x) x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The outer <span class="v">with-output</span> call saves the current output settings (as may 
 have been modified by earlier calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a></span>), by 
 pushing them onto a stack, and then turns off all output.  Each inner 
 <span class="v">with-output</span> call temporarily pops that stack, restoring the starting 
 output settings, until it completes and undoes the effects of that pop. 
 Unless <span class="v">event</span> output was inhibited at the top level (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>), the following output is shown:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Since F2 is non-recursive, its admission is trivial.  We observe that
the type of F2 is described by the theorem (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (F2 X) X).</pre> 
 
 <p>And then, if <span class="v">summary</span> output was not inhibited at the top level, we get 
 the rest of this output:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Summary
Form:  ( DEFUN F2 ...)
Rules: NIL
Warnings:  None
Time:  0.00 seconds (prove: 0.00, print: 0.00, other: 0.00)

Summary
Form:  ( IN-THEORY NIL)
Rules: NIL
Warnings:  None
Time:  0.00 seconds (prove: 0.00, print: 0.00, other: 0.00)</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that the use of <span class="v">:off warning</span> suppresses a <span class="v">"Theory"</span> warning 
 for the <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> nil)</span> event, and that in no case will output be printed 
 for definitions of <span class="v">f1</span>, <span class="v">f3</span>, or <span class="v">f4</span>, or for the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event itself.</p> 
 
 <p>The following more detailed explanation of <span class="v">:stack</span> is intended only for 
 advanced users.  After <span class="v">:gag-mode</span> and <span class="v">:evisc</span> are handled (if present) 
 but before <span class="v">:on</span> or <span class="v">:off</span> is handled, the value of <span class="v">:stack</span> is 
 handled as follows.  If the value is <span class="v">:push</span>, then <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global 
 <span class="v">inhibit-output-lst-stack</span> is modified by pushing the cons of the values of 
 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> globals <span class="v">inhibit-output-lst</span> and <span class="v">gag-mode</span> onto the value 
 of <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global <span class="v">inhibit-output-lst-stack</span>, which is <span class="v">nil</span> at the 
 top level.  If the value is <span class="v">:pop</span>, then <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global 
 <span class="v">inhibit-output-lst-stack</span> is modified only if non-<span class="v">nil</span>, in which case 
 its top element is popped and provides the values of <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> globals 
 <span class="v">inhibit-output-lst</span> and <span class="v">gag-mode</span>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Concluding remarks</h3> 
 
 <p>Remark 1.  <b>Warning</b>: <span class="v">With-output</span> has no effect in raw 
 Lisp (other than to expand to the provided <span class="v">form</span> argument), and hence is 
 disallowed in function bodies.  However, you can probably get the effect you 
 want as illustrated below, where <span class="v">&lt;form&gt;</span> must return an error-triple 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val state)</span>; see <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> and see <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Remark 2.  Here are examples avoiding <span class="v">with-output</span>, for use in function 
 definitions.  But note that <span class="v">with-output!</span> can be used in function 
 definitions.</p>
