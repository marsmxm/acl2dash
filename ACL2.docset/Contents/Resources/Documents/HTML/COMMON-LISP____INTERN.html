<p>Create a new symbol in a given package</p><p><span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTERN.html">intern</a> symbol-name symbol-package-name)</span> returns a symbol with 
 the given <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> and the given <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span>.  We 
 restrict Common Lisp's <span class="v">intern</span> so that the second argument is either the 
 symbol *main-lisp-package-name*, the value of that constant, or is one of 
 "ACL2", "ACL2-INPUT-CHANNEL", "ACL2-OUTPUT-CHANNEL", or "KEYWORD".  To 
 avoid that restriction, see <a href="ACL2____INTERN_42.html">intern$</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>In ACL2 <span class="v">intern</span> is actually implemented as a macro that expands to a 
 call of a similar function whose second argument is a symbol.  Invoke <span class="v">:pe
 intern</span> to see the definition, or see <a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>To see why is <span class="v">intern</span> so restricted consider <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTERN.html">intern</a> "X" "P")</span>. 
 In particular, is it a symbol and if so, what is its <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span>?  One is tempted to say ``yes, it is a symbol in the 
 package <span class="v">"P"</span>.''  But if package <span class="v">"P"</span> has not yet been defined, 
 that would be premature because the imports to the package are unknown.  For 
 example, if <span class="v">"P"</span> were introduced with</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "P" '(LISP::X))</pre> 
 
 <p>then in Common Lisp <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTERN.html">intern</a> "X" "P"))</span> returns 
 <span class="v">"LISP"</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The obvious restriction on <span class="v">intern</span> is that its second argument be the 
 name of a package known to ACL2.  We cannot express such a restriction 
 (except, for example, by limiting it to those packages known at some fixed 
 time, as we do).  Instead, we provide <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a></span> 
 which requires a ``witness symbol'' for the package instead of the package. 
 The witness symbol is any symbol (expressible in ACL2) and uniquely specifies 
 a package necessarily known to ACL2.</p>
