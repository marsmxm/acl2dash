<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____PROGN_B2SUBSUME-TTAGS">Click for Progn+subsume-ttags in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Execute some events, subsuming the specified ttags with the current ttag.</p><pre class="code">Example:
(<a href="ACL2____PROGN_B2SUBSUME-TTAGS.html">progn+subsume-ttags</a>
  ((:foo) (:bar))
  (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>
   "foo" :ttags ((:foo)))
  (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>
   "bar" :ttags ((:bar))))</pre> 
 
 <p>This is like <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> except that the first argument is a ttag-spec 
 (See <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>) to be authorized within the constituent events and then 
 subsumed.  That is, an active ttag is required to use this form and that ttag 
 is (first) used to allow the use of other ttags that may not already be 
 authorized and (second) used to wipe the record that any extra ttags were 
 used.  This is what is meant by subsumption.  If my book requires a ttag, I 
 can then use this to include other books/forms requiring other ttags without 
 those others needing specific prior authorization. 
 
 An active ttag is required to use this form (See <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>).</p>
