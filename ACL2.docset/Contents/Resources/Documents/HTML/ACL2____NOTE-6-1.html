<p>ACL2 Version  6.1 (February, 2013) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we roughly organize the changes since Version 6.0 into the following 
 categories of changes: existing features, new features, heuristic 
 improvements, bug fixes, changes at the system level, Emacs support, and 
 experimental versions.  Each change is described in just one category, though 
 of course many changes could be placed in more than one category.</p> 
 
 <p><b>CHANGES TO EXISTING FEATURES</b></p> 
 
 <p>More system functions are in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode, <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified.  Evaluate</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____STRIP-CARS.html">strip-cars</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a> "system/top" *system-verify-guards-alist*)))</pre> 
 
 <p>for the list of functions checked to be guard-verifiable in the community 
 books.  (NOTE added after Version_8.3: The form is now <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____STRIP-CARS.html">strip-cars</a>
 *system-verify-guards-alist*)</span>.)  Thanks to those who have contributed to 
 this effort, as shown in file headers in directory <span class="v">system/</span> of the 
 community books.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUND.html">defund</a></span> now avoids an error when <span class="v">:mode :program</span> has 
 been specified in an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> form of a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> form, for 
 example: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUND.html">defund</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :mode :program)) x)</span>.  It does this 
 by avoiding the generation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in such cases. 
 Thanks to David Rager and Jared Davis for requesting such a change, and for 
 ensuing helpful discussions.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a field <span class="v">:UNIFY-SUBST</span> to metafunction contexts (see <a href="ACL2____EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>), accessed with function <span class="v">mfc-unify-subst</span>.  Thanks 
 to Sol Swords for requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>The functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a></span> are now <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>-mode functions.</p> 
 
 <p>It had been the case that if any supporter of a dependent clause processor 
 (see <a href="ACL2____DEFINE-TRUSTED-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">define-trusted-clause-processor</a>) is among the ancestors of a given 
 formula, then it was illegal to apply functional instantiation (see <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>) to that formula.  Now, this is illegal only if some such 
 supporter is in the domain of the functional substitution.</p> 
 
 <p>The tau system (see <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>, or if you are unfamiliar with the 
 tau system, see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-TAU-SYSTEM.html">introduction-to-the-tau-system</a>) now allows the user to 
 define and verify functions that compute bounds on arithmetic expressions. 
 See <a href="ACL2____BOUNDERS.html">bounders</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="v">print-summary-user</span> has been replaced by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FINALIZE-EVENT-USER.html">finalize-event-user</a></span>, which is described below.  If you previously attached a 
 function to <span class="v">print-summary-user</span>, say <span class="v">my-print-summary-user</span>, then you 
 can get the effect you had previously as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> my-finalize-event-user (<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :mode :logic :stobjs state))
  (<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (my-print-summary-user state)
          state))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a> finalize-event-user my-finalize-event-user)</pre> 
 
 <p>It had been the case that when you <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> a file, the connected book 
 directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>) was set to the canonical pathname of that file's 
 directory for the duration of the <span class="v">LD</span> call.  This could cause problems, 
 however, if the file is actually a soft link: an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form in 
 the book with a relative pathname for the book would be resolved with respect 
 to the absolute pathname for that link, which is probably not what was 
 intended.  So soft links are no longer followed when computing the above 
 connected book directory.  The following example, which is how we discovered 
 this problem, may clarify.  We attempted to execute the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a>
 "top.lisp")</span> using ACL2(r) (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>) in community books directory 
 <span class="v">nonstd/arithmetic/</span>, where all of the <span class="v">.lisp</span> files are soft links to 
 files in <span class="v">arithmetic/</span>.  Thus, the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "equalities")</span> 
 attempted to include <span class="v">arithmetic/equalities</span> instead of 
 <span class="v">nonstd/arithmetic/equalities</span>, which caused an error.</p> 
 
 <p>We no longer document the use of value <span class="v">:START</span> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">with-prover-step-limit</a></span>.  This value has always been used by the ACL2 
 implementation and may have semantics that change with new ACL2 versions.  If 
 you have reason to use this value, please contact the ACL2 implementors.</p> 
 
 <p><b>NEW FEATURES</b></p> 
 
 <p>By default, the prover now gives information about case splits.  See <a href="ACL2____SPLITTER.html">splitter</a>.  Thanks to many ACL2 users, most recently David Rager, for 
 requesting such a capability.  Also thanks to David Rager and Jared Davis for 
 helpful discussions, and thanks to Robert Krug for feedback on the initial 
 implementation and documentation that led us to make improvements.</p> 
 
 <p>New utilities <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INITIALIZE-EVENT-USER.html">initialize-event-user</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FINALIZE-EVENT-USER.html">finalize-event-user</a></span> 
 allow the user to run <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>-modifying code at the start and end of 
 <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  Thanks to Harsh Raju Chamarthi for requesting these 
 capabilities.  Note that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FINALIZE-EVENT-USER.html">finalize-event-user</a></span> replaces 
 <span class="v">print-summary-user</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>HEURISTIC IMPROVEMENTS</b></p> 
 
 <p>Several heuristic improvements have been made to the tau system, even if 
 you do not explicitly use the new capability for computing bounds on 
 arithmetic expressions, mentioned above.  See <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>, or if you are 
 unfamiliar with the tau system, see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-TAU-SYSTEM.html">introduction-to-the-tau-system</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>BUG FIXES</b></p> 
 
 <p>A soundness bug has been fixed that exploited the use of expansion files 
 (see <a href="ACL2____BOOK-COMPILED-FILE.html">book-compiled-file</a>) together with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span>.  For an 
 example illustrating this bug, see the comment about ``Expansion/Defstobj 
 Bug'' in the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a> note-6-1 ...)</span> in ACL2 source file 
 <span class="v">ld.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We fixed a soundness bug involving system function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CANONICAL-PATHNAME.html">canonical-pathname</a></span> and (most likely) other functions in the former value of 
 constant <span class="v">*unattachable-primitives*</span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis and Sol Swords 
 for bringing this bug to our attention by way of an example.  We include a 
 very slight variant of that example in a comment within the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a>
 note-6-1 ...)</span> in ACL2 source file <span class="v">ld.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>There was a soundness bug that allowed attachments to prove <span class="v">nil</span> in a 
 consistent logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> involving <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>. 
 This has been fixed, by requiring that no function symbol ancestral in a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> formula is allowed to get an attachment.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>, in particular discussion of ``a restriction based on a notion of a 
 function symbol syntactically supporting an event'', which concludes with a 
 proof of <span class="v">nil</span> that is no longer possible.</p> 
 
 <p>(ACL2(h) only) We fixed a soundness bug in the interaction of memoization 
 with congruent stobjs, in cases where the <span class="v">:congruent-to</span> field of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> was not the canonical representative in the congruence class.  For 
 an example illustrating this bug, see the comment about ``memoize/congruent 
 stobj bug'' in the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a> note-6-1 ...)</span>  in ACL2 source file 
 <span class="v">ld.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Functions defined by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> had failed to be compiled when 
 certifying books, except in host Lisps that compile on-the-fly (CCL, SBCL). 
 This has been fixed for all host Lisps.  A related change, probably less 
 significant, was made for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFABSSTOBJ.html">defabsstobj</a></span>.  Thanks to Sol Swords for 
 reporting bugs that turned out to be mistakes in a preliminary implementation 
 of this change.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed an assertion error involving linear arithmetic.  Thanks to Sol Swords 
 for sending an example illustrating the bug (now appearing as a comment in 
 ACL2 source function <span class="v">linearize1</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was breaking the ACL2s build mechanism (see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-SEDAN.html">ACL2-sedan</a>) by causing certain needless evaluation of ``hidden <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>'' forms in <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> files when executing a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  The bug could also affect rare error messages arising from 
 ill-formed <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> files.  Thanks to Harsh Raju Chamarthi for 
 bringing this bug to our attention by sending us an example script of the sort 
 that was breaking during an ACL2s build.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed handling of pathnames by some low-level code (system function 
 <span class="v">our-truename</span>) that could cause errors, for example for host-Lisp GCL on 
 some platforms when environment variable <span class="v">HOME</span> points to a non-existent 
 directory.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for bringing this issue to our attention 
 and helping with the debugging.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a coding bug in generation of stobj resizing functions for a stobj 
 named <span class="v">OLD</span>.  The following example illustrates the bug.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> old
  (fld :type (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ARRAY.html">array</a> (unsigned-byte 31) (8))
        :initially 0 :resizable t))
(resize-fld 10 old)
; The following returned 8 but should have returned 10:
(fld-length old)</pre> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFABSSTOBJ-MISSING-EVENTS.html">defabsstobj-missing-events</a></span> (which macroexpanded 
 incorrectly).  Thanks to Sol Swords for bringing this bug to our 
 attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed two bugs in the handling of step-limits.  Thanks to Hanbing Liu for 
 bringing the main such bug to our attention, which was that ACL2 could report 
 a step-limit violation during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> (in fact, during any 
 compound event such as a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span>), even 
 without direct user involvement in managing step-limits (see <a href="ACL2____SET-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">set-prover-step-limit</a> and see <a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">with-prover-step-limit</a>).  The other bug 
 was that a bad argument to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">set-prover-step-limit</a></span> could result in a raw 
 Lisp error, for example: <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a> (<a href="ACL2____SET-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">set-prover-step-limit</a> '(a b)))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>CHANGES AT THE SYSTEM LEVEL</b></p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">books/</span> directory no longer needs to exist in order to build an 
 ACL2 executable.  Thanks to Robert Krug for pointing out that the installation 
 instructions had suggested that this was already the case.</p> 
 
 <p>Many changes have been made to the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>.  For example, 
 some community books now include <span class="v">std/lists/rev.lisp</span>, which contains the 
 rule <span class="v">revappend-removal</span>, which may cause some proofs involving <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____REVAPPEND.html">revappend</a></span> to fail where they formerly succeeded, or vice-versa.  When a proof 
 fails that formerly succeeded, it may be useful for you to look over the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s printed in the event summary.</p> 
 
 <p><b>EMACS SUPPORT</b></p> 
 
 <p><b>EXPERIMENTAL/ALTERNATE VERSIONS</b></p> 
 
 <p>For ACL2(p), <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a></span> is now locked by default; thanks to 
 David Rager for suggesting this change.  But there is a way to avoid the lock; 
 see <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a>.  In particular, the lock is avoided in the 
 implementations of <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> and <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING-REPORTS.html">forward-chaining-reports</a>, which are not supported in ACL2(p) (see <a href="ACL2____UNSUPPORTED-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM-FEATURES.html">unsupported-waterfall-parallelism-features</a>).</p>
