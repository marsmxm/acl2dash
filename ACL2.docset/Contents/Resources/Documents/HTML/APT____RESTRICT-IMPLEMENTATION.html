<p>Implementation of <span class="tt"><a href="APT____RESTRICT.html">restrict</a></span>.</p><p>The implementation functions have arguments, 
                        as well as results (in the <a href="STD____RETURNS-SPECIFIERS.html"><span class="v">:returns</span> specifiers</a>), consistently named as follows:</p><ul>
