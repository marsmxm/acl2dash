<p>Collect SystemVerilog files from across your design into a single 
file.</p><p>You can use the <span class="v">vl gather</span> command to collect up Verilog 
designs, which might be split across several files in many directories, into a 
single file that is otherwise unsimplified.</p> 
 
<p>This kind of consolidation may be useful for a number of reasons, e.g., it 
may allow you to quickly do things like grepping through the entire design, 
grab a snapshot of the entire design, etc.</p> 
 
<p>Note that if you just want to process designs with VL, there's normally no 
reason that you need to use this command.  VL's <a href="VL____LOADER.html">loader</a> can be given 
<a href="VL____VL-LOADCONFIG.html">vl-loadconfig</a> options like <span class="v">search-path</span> and <span class="v">include-dirs</span> to 
allow it to find modules from many directories.</p> 
 
<p>For usage information, run <span class="v">vl gather --help</span> or see <a href="VL_____A2VL-GATHER-HELP_A2.html">*vl-gather-help*</a>.</p>
