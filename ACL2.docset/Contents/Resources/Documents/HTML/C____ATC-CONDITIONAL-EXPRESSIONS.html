<p>Representation of C conditional expressions for ATC.</p><p>C conditional expressions and statements are both non-strict, 
     so they both have to be represented by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> in ACL2. 
     To provide control on which <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>s represent conditional statements 
     and which <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>s represent conditional expressions, 
     we provide a function <span class="tt"><a href="C____CONDEXPR.html">condexpr</a></span> that is just identity 
     but can be used to wrap an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> to signify that 
     it represents a C conditional expression instead of statement. 
     Without that wrapper, an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> represents a conditional statement, 
     which is more common than a conditional expression in C.</p>
