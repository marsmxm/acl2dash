  <p>Notice that <span class="v">nat-treep</span> and <span class="v">copy-nat-tree</span> each contain a simple 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span> in which the function being defined is called recursively. 
  <span class="v">Copy-nat-tree</span> is a little more complicated than <span class="v">nat-treep</span> because 
  <span class="v">copy-nat-tree</span> also contains a recursive call outside of any 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>.  Notice also that both events specify the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> 
  <span class="v">:loop$-recursion t</span> and explicitly provide a <span class="v">:measure</span>.  The usual 
  other <span class="v">xargs</span> are optional but <span class="v">:loop$-recursion t</span> is required if 
  recursion is used inside a <span class="v">loop$</span> and the measure must be made 
  explicit.</p> 
 
  <p>Some examples of <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive definitions may be found in the book 
  <span class="v">projects/apply/loop-recursion-examples.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Warning:</b> Even though the functions defined above are recursive, 
  ACL2 does not generate induction schemes for them!  If you want to do 
  inductive proofs about <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions you must provide a 
  suitable <span class="v">:induction</span> hint.  In addition, to be provable by induction, 
  theorems about <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions must be suitably general.  This 
  topic is discussed further in <a href="ACL2____LOOP_42-RECURSION-INDUCTION.html">loop$-recursion-induction</a>.</p> 
 
  <h3>Restrictions</h3> 
 
  <p>If a function being defined exhibits recursion from within a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span> 
  body or within the <span class="v">when</span> or <span class="v">until</span> clauses of a <span class="v">loop$</span> in a 
  <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> of <i>fn</i>, then the <span class="v">defun</span> must include an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> 
  declaration with <span class="v">:loop$-recursion t</span>.  In addition,</p> 
 
  <ul> 
 
  <li>the <span class="v">xargs</span> declaration must include an explicit <span class="v">:measure</span>,</li> 
 
  <li>
<i>fn</i> must not be part of a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> clique,</li> 
 
  <li>every formal of <i>fn</i> must be ``ordinary,'' e.g., not of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ILK.html">ilk</a></span> 
  <span class="v">:FN</span> or <span class="v">:EXPR</span>,</li> 
 
  <li>
<i>fn</i> must return a single value,</li> 
 
  <li>
<i>fn</i>'s measure must be of type <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a></span> or be a lexicographic 
  combination of natural numbers as defined by the <span class="v">llist</span> function in the 
  Community Books at <span class="v">books/ordinals/</span>,</li> 
 
  <li>
<i>fn</i> must be <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a></span>, which implies it may not take or 
  return <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span>s,</li> 
 
  <li>every quoted <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span> object in the body of <i>fn</i> must be 
  well-formed (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WELL-FORMED-LAMBDA-OBJECTP.html">well-formed-lambda-objectp</a></span>), which implies that 
  every such <span class="v">lambda</span> object is tame and every function symbol, including 
  <i>fn</i>, used in each must have a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span>,</li> 
 
  <li>every quoted <span class="v">lambda</span> object in the body of <i>fn</i> that calls 
  <i>fn</i> recursively must occur as the first argument of a <span class="v">loop$</span> scion 
  and <i>not</i> in some arbitrary scion,</li> 
 
  <li>there is at least one recursive call of <i>fn</i> inside a quoted 
  <span class="v">lambda</span> object which means that the <span class="v">loop$-recursion t</span> declaration 
  was actually necessary, and</li> 
 
  <li>the necessary measure conjectures (see below) must be proved.</li> 
 
  </ul> 
 
  <p>These restrictions make a little more sense if you reflect on what has to 
  be done to check and admit a <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive function.  First, we assume 
  that most ACL2 functions are not <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive.  So to keep 
  <span class="v">defun</span>-processing as fast as possible, we require you to declare when you 
  are using <span class="v">loop$</span> recursion.  That declaration triggers additional 
  checks.</p> 
 
  <p>But before checks can begin, we have to translate the body of <i>fn</i> 
  and since <span class="v">loop$</span>s translate into calls of <span class="v">loop$</span> scions on quoted 
  <span class="v">lambda</span>s and those must be tame, and since some of those <span class="v">lambda</span>s 
  involve calls of <i>fn</i>, we must assign a badge to <i>fn</i> even before 
  we have translated its body.  We assign a badge that declares <i>fn</i> to 
  take the appropriate number of ordinary inputs, to return one result, and be 
  tame.  We check those requirements after <i>fn</i> has been admitted.</p> 
 
  <p>Because the measure guessing heuristics of ACL2 do not look for calls 
  inside of quoted <span class="v">lambda</span>s, the measure must be explicitly declared even 
  if it <span class="v">acl2-count</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>To find every recursive call in a quoted <span class="v">lambda</span> object those objects 
  must all be well-formed.  If such an object occurs as the first argument of a 
  <span class="v">loop$</span> scion then we know it is only applied to elements of the 
  <span class="v">loop$</span> scion's target.  Given that, we can investigate whether the 
  recursive calls in the <span class="v">lambda</span> object are on smaller things.  But if a 
  recursive call were to occur in a quoted <span class="v">lambda</span> object that was passed 
  to some other kind of scion, we have no way to know (without extensive 
  analysis) to what it might be applied.</p> 
 
  <p>Some of these restrictions could be lifted with more analysis and coding. 
  For example, we could change the specification for the <span class="v">:loop$-recursion</span> 
  <span class="v">xargs</span> keyword so that instead of taking on a Boolean value it takes on a 
  badge.  Then we could tentatively assign that badge to <i>fn</i> before 
  processing and check it afterwards.  Our current thinking is to ask users to 
  live with these restrictions and let us see whether <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursion is 
  useful (almost certainly it will be), whether the community can develop proof 
  techniques and tools to reason about them as effectively as we reason about 
  conventional recursive functions (we're optimistic), and whether investing 
  time in lifting some of these restrictions is worth it given all the other 
  ways we could improve ACL2.</p> 
 
  <h3>Measure Conjectures</h3> 
 
  <p>Measure conjectures must be generated for the recursive calls inside 
  <span class="v">loop$</span> bodies.  (We also generate conjectures for the recursive calls the 
  other <span class="v">loop$</span>-expression components, e.g., the <span class="v">when</span> clause, exactly 
  analogously, but we speak of the <span class="v">loop$</span> body only below.  We also focus 
  on simple <span class="v">loop$</span>s here but the conjectures decribed generalize to fancy 
  <span class="v">loop$</span>s.)  Given a recursive call inside the body of a <span class="v">loop$</span> with 
  iteration variable <i>v</i>, we first generate a new variable symbol, 
  <i>v'</i>.  Certain terms, e.g., tests and arguments to recursive calls, will 
  be extracted from within the body and used in the measure conjecture.  We 
  rename <i>v</i> to <i>v'</i> in these terms to distinguish occurrences of 
  <i>v</i> outside the <span class="v">loop$</span> from those inside.  The measure conjecture 
  requires us to prove that the given measure decreases, as usual.  But the 
  ruling tests are those ruling the <span class="v">loop$</span>, conjoined with the hypothesis 
  that <i>v'</i> is a member of the target, conjoined with the (renamed) tests 
  from inside the body ruling the recursive call.</p> 
 
  <p>Below is an example.  We show only the measure conjectures generated from 
  inside the <span class="v">loop$</span> because there are two recursive calls in the <span class="v">loop$</span> 
  body.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> fn (v)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :loop$-recursion t
                  :measure (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> x)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a>
   ((<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> v)
    ...)
   ((<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> v)
    (<a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a> for v in (target v) sum
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> v) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> v 0))
               (fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> v))
               (fn v))))
   (t ...)))</pre> 
 
  <p>Note that <span class="v">v</span> used both as the formal of <span class="v">fn</span> and as the iterative 
  variable of the <span class="v">loop$</span>.  In the measure conjectures below, the iterative 
  variable has been renamed to <span class="v">nv0</span>.  Two measure conjectures are generated 
  from within the <span class="v">loop$</span>:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> v))
              (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> v)
              (<a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a> nv0 (target v))
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> nv0) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> nv0 0)))
         (<a href="ACL2____O_C3.html">o&lt;</a> (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> nv0))
             (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> v)))

(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> v))
              (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> v)
              (<a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a> nv0 (target v))
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> nv0) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> nv0 0))))
         (<a href="ACL2____O_C3.html">o&lt;</a> (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> nv0) (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> v)))</pre> 
 
  <p>Note that these conjectures require that when <span class="v">fn</span> is called from 
  within the <span class="v">loop$</span> the argument is smaller than the initial value of the 
  formal.  Notice also that there is no <i>a priori</i> restriction on the size 
  of <span class="v">(target v)</span>.  However, because of the way <span class="v">fn</span> is used inside this 
  particular example <span class="v">loop$</span>, there are restrictions on the size of the 
  elements of <span class="v">(target v)</span>.  These conjectures, along with those generated 
  from calls outside the <span class="v">loop$</span> are sufficient to guarantee that <span class="v">fn</span> 
  always terminates.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Note:</b> Careful readers might note that the way we handle measure 
  conjectures for <span class="v">loop$</span>s differs from the way we handle guard conjectures 
  for <span class="v">loop$</span>s.  In <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span> we explained that <span class="v">loop$</span>s are 
  translated into calls of <span class="v">loop$</span> <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SCION.html">scion</a></span>s on quoted <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span> 
  objects and that the guard conjectures for the <span class="v">lambda</span> are insensitive to 
  the context in which the object appeared.  But the measure conjectures are 
  sensitive to the context: tests from outside the <span class="v">loop$</span> are present in 
  the measure conjectures.  This is deliberate.  Guard conjectures are context 
  insensitive because the implementation caches compiled <span class="v">lambda</span> objects 
  without remembering the contexts in which they first occurred.  Thus, a 
  <span class="v">lambda</span> object generated by a <span class="v">loop$</span> may be called on anything and we 
  cannot guarantee that the input guard to the <span class="v">lambda</span> object will be 
  satisfied.  <i>But we can guarantee that the computation carried out by the 
  <span class="v">lambda</span> will terminate!</i> The <span class="v">lambda</span> object generated for <span class="v">fn</span> 
  above terminates no matter what it is called on -- even if called on elements 
  not in <span class="v">(target v)</span> -- because <span class="v">fn</span> terminates.</p> 
 
  <p>Finally, recall that <span class="v">loop$</span>-recursive functions do not automatically 
  suggest induction schemes and that special care must be taken when 
  formulating inductively provable conjectures about them.  See <a href="ACL2____LOOP_42-RECURSION-INDUCTION.html">loop$-recursion-induction</a>.</p>
