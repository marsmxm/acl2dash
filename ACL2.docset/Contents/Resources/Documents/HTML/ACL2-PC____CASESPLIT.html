<p>(primitive) 
split into two cases</p><pre class="code">Example:
(casesplit (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y)) -- assuming that we are at the top of the
                       conclusion, add (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y) as a new top-level
                       hypothesis in the current goal, and create a
                       subgoal identical to the current goal except
                       that it has (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y)) as a new top-level
                       hypothesis

General Form:
(casesplit expr &amp;optional use-hyps-flag do-not-flatten-flag)</pre> 
 
 <p>When the current subterm is the entire conclusion, this instruction adds 
 <span class="v">expr</span> as a new top-level hypothesis, and create a subgoal identical to the 
 existing current goal except that it has the negation of <span class="v">expr</span> as a new 
 top-level hypothesis.  Also see <a href="ACL2-PC____CLAIM.html">ACL2-pc::claim</a>.  The optional arguments 
 control the use of governors and the ``flattening'' of new hypotheses, as we 
 now explain.</p> 
 
 <p>The argument <span class="v">use-hyps-flag</span> is only of interest when there are 
 governors.  (To read about governors, see <a href="ACL2-PC____HYPS.html">ACL2-pc::hyps</a>).  In that 
 case, if <span class="v">use-hyps-flag</span> is not supplied or is <span class="v">nil</span>, then the 
 description above is correct; but otherwise, it is not <span class="v">expr</span> but rather it 
 is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> govs expr)</span> that is added as a new top-level hypothesis (and 
 whose negation is added as a top-level hypothesis for the new goal), where 
 <span class="v">govs</span> is the conjunction of the governors.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">do-not-flatten-flag</span> is supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>, then that is all 
 there is to this command.  Otherwise (thus this is the default), when the 
 claimed term (first argument) is a conjunction (<span class="v">and</span>) of terms and the 
 <span class="v">claim</span> instruction succeeds, then each (nested) conjunct of the claimed 
 term is added as a separate new top-level hypothesis.  Consider the following 
 example, assuming there are no governors.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(casesplit (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> a)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> r s)) t)</pre> 
 
 <p>Three new top-level hypotheses are added to the current goal, namely <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a>
 x y)</span>, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> a)</span>, and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> r s)</span>.  In that case, only one 
 hypothesis is added to create the new goal, namely the negation of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a>
 x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> a) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> r s))</span>.  If the negation of this term had been 
 <span class="v">claim</span>ed, then it would be the other way around: the current goal would 
 get a single new hypothesis while the new goal would be created by adding 
 three hypotheses.</p>
