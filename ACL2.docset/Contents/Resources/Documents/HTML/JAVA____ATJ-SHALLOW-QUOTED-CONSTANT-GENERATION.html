<p>Representation of quoted constants in the shallow embedding.</p><p>In the shallow embedding approach, 
     each quoted constant in the ACL2 code 
     is translated to a Java static final field 
     that is calculated once at class initialization time 
     and then just referenced in the Java code. 
     Since ACL2 values are objects, 
     this avoids recalculating the object 
     (whether it is created or reused, e.g. when interned) 
     every time the shallowly embedded quoted constant 
     is executed in the Java code.</p><p>We extract all the quoted constants 
     from the pre-translated bodies of the ACL2 functions, 
     and we create a static final field for each. 
     For now we only do this for quoted numbers, characters, and strings, 
     but we will cover the other quoted values soon. 
     The fields for these quoted constants 
     are declared in the generated main class; 
     they are named in a way that describes their value, 
     e.g. see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-GEN-SHALLOW-NUMBER-FIELD-NAME.html">atj-gen-shallow-number-field-name</a></span>.</p>
