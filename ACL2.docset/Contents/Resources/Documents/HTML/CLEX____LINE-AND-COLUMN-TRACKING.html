<p>Routines for tracking line and column numbers as we iterate through a 
string.</p><p>Keeping track of the line and column number is practically 
important for producing good error messages.  The routines here are rather 
specialized, and are mainly designed for use within our input stream 
mechanism.</p> 
 
<p>The normal convention used by, e.g., text editors like EMACS, is to show 
line numbers starting at 1.  We adopt this convention in the interface to 
our input streams.</p> 
 
<p>However, <b>internally</b> we treat line numbers as starting at 0.  This 
This has the good property that the line number never exceeds our current 
character position in the file.  As a result, restricting ourselves to fixnum 
positions automatically gives us fixnum line (and column) numbers.</p>
