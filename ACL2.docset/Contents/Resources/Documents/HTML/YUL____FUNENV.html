<p>Fixtype of function environments.</p><p>This is a list of function scopes, 
     which represents a stack; 
     the stack grows leftward, i.e. 
     push is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span>, pop is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span>, and top is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>. 
     A function scope is pushed when entering a block, 
     and it is popped when exiting the block. 
     This needs to be a stack because Yul functions are statically scoped: 
     when a function later in the stack calls a function earlier in the stack, 
     the stack must be shrunk so that the called function 
     has access only to the functions that are statically in scope, 
     not the functions in inner blocks that the caller has access to.</p><p>[Yul: Specification of Yul: Formal Specification] 
     does not explicitly mention any notion of function environments, 
     but their presence is implicit in the description of 
     the scope of function definitions.</p>
