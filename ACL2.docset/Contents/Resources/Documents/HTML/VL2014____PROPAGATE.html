<p>Eliminate assignments to simple "intermediate" wires. (UNSOUND)</p><p>This is a basic assignment-propagation simplification.  The idea is 
to reduce modules that have lots of intermediate wires by just replacing the 
wire with its expression.  For instance, a module that had assignments 
like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign a1 = ~a2;
assign a2 = ~a3;
assign a3 = ~a4;
assign a4 = ~a5;</pre> 
 
<p>Could presumably be propagated into:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign a1 = ~(~(~(~a5)));</pre> 
 
<p>Which we could then reduce in other ways.</p> 
 
<p>This transformation is <b>generally unsound</b>.  We aren't really doing any 
checking to make sure that we are substituting into contexts with compatible 
widths, etc.  We're also relying on the :DIR fields on module instance 
arguments, which is probably not safe when ports are incorrectly marked as 
inputs instead of outputs, etc.</p> 
 
<p>Prerequisites: arguments need to be resolved so we can tell directions on 
module/gate instance ports.</p>
