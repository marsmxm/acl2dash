<p>Modified Merkle Patricia trees.</p><p>A Modified Merkle Patricia tree 
     (which we abbreviate as `MMP tree' 
     in the documentation of our Ethereum model) 
     is an Ethereum data structure 
     that combines characteristics of 
     Merkle trees and Patricia (a.k.a. radix) trees. 
     MMP trees are described in [YP:D] and in 
     <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Patricia-Tree" target="_blank"><nobr>Page `Patricia Tree' of [Wiki]<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/Patricia-Tree"></nobr></a>; 
     we reference that page of [Wiki] as `[Wiki:MMP]'.</p><p>MMP trees are not merely implementation-level entities. 
     Their root hashes appear 
     at the interface of Ethereum with the external world, 
     e.g. as the <b>stateRoot</b> component of a block [YP:4.3]. 
     Thus, a formalization of MMP trees, 
     in particular of the calculation of root hashes, 
     belongs to a formal model of Ethereum 
     that covers the interface to the external world, 
     even if the formal model is high-level, declarative, and non-executable.</p>
