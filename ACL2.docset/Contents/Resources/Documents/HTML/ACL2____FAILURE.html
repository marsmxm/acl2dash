<p>How to deal with a failure to admit an event</p><p>There are many reasons why an event can fail to be admitted. 
 Generally, an error message will explain the failure, sometimes pointing to 
 documentation that is specific to the relevant issue.  There are tools that 
 can sometimes help: for example, to debug failures of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> or 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> events, as well as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> failures, see <a href="ACL2____REDO-FLAT.html">redo-flat</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>However, proof failures are typically not as trivial to debug as, for 
 example, syntactic errors (such as spelling errors in the name of a function). 
 Fortunately, ACL2 offers a variety of techniques for dealing with proof 
 failures, and some are discussed below.  Also see relevant subtopics of the 
 topic, <a href="ACL2____DEBUGGING.html">debugging</a>.  Some frequently-used tools for proof debugging that 
 are discussed in those subtopics include <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a>, <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____CGEN.html">cgen</a>, and <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____NIL-GOAL.html">nil-goal</a> for ideas about how to proceed when the prover generates a goal of 
 <span class="v">NIL</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We turn now to the problem of dealing with proof failures.</p> 
 
 <p>When ACL2 gives up it does not mean that the submitted conjecture is 
 invalid, even if the last formula ACL2 printed in its proof attempt is 
 manifestly false.  Since ACL2 sometimes <a href="ACL2____GENERALIZE.html">generalize</a>s the goal being 
 proved, it is possible it adopted an invalid subgoal as a legitimate (but 
 doomed) strategy for proving a valid goal.  Nevertheless, conjectures 
 submitted to ACL2 are often invalid and the proof attempt often leads the 
 careful reader to the realization that a hypothesis has been omitted or that 
 some special case has been forgotten.  It is good practice to ask yourself, 
 when you see a proof attempt fail, whether the conjecture submitted is 
 actually a theorem.</p> 
 
 <p>If you think the conjecture is a theorem, then you must figure out from 
 ACL2's output what you know that ACL2 doesn't about the functions in the 
 conjecture and how to impart that knowledge to ACL2 in the form of rules.  The 
 ``key checkpoint'' information printed at the end of the <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> 
 provides a fine place to start.  See <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a> for a general 
 discussion of how to prove theorems with ACL2, and see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> for a more detailed tutorial.  Also see 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> for discussion of key checkpoints and an abbreviated 
 output mode that focuses attention on them.  You may find it most useful to 
 start by focusing on key checkpoints that are not under a proof by induction, 
 if any, both because these are more likely to suggest useful lemmas and 
 because they are more likely to be theorems; for example, generalization may 
 have occurred before a proof by induction has begun.  If you need more 
 information than is provided by the key checkpoints — although this 
 should rarely be necessary — then you can look at the full proof, 
 perhaps with the aid of certain utilities: see <a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a>, <a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a>, and <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.  System hackers may want to consider 
 using the utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-LIST.html">checkpoint-list</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Again, see <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a> for a general discussion of how to prove 
 theorems with ACL2, and see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> for a 
 more detailed tutorial.  See also the book ``Computer-Aided Reasoning: An 
 Approach'' (Kaufmann, Manolios, Moore), as well as the discussion of how to 
 read Nqthm proofs and how to use Nqthm rules in ``A Computational Logic 
 Handbook'' by Boyer and Moore (Academic Press, 1988).</p>
