<p>Reporting of rules whose application may have caused case splits</p><p>When the ACL2 rewriter applies a rule to a term, a goal might 
 simplify to more than one subgoal.  A rule with such an application is called 
 a ``splitter''.  Here, we explain the output produced for splitters when proof 
 output is enabled (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>) and such reporting is 
 turned on (as it is by default)  that is, when the value of 
 <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">splitter-output</a></span><span class="v">)</span> is true.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____SET-SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">set-splitter-output</a> for how to turn off, or on, the reporting of 
 splitters.  Also see <a href="ACL2____SET-CASE-SPLIT-LIMITATIONS.html">set-case-split-limitations</a> for information on how 
 to control case splits.  Note that since splitters are rule applications, 
 splitter output is not generated for case splits that are caused by other than 
 rules, such as the mere presence of calls of the function symbol, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>, 
 in the goal.</p> 
 
 <p>We begin by describing three types of splitters.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p><span class="v">if-intro</span>: The rule application may have introduced a call of <span class="v">IF</span>, 
 in the sense discussed at the end below.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">case-split</span>: For the application of a rule with hypothesis of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a> &lt;hyp&gt;)</span>, <span class="v">&lt;hyp&gt;</span> did not simplify to true or false.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">immed-forced</span>: For the application of a rule with hypothesis of the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> &lt;hyp&gt;)</span>, <span class="v">&lt;hyp&gt;</span> did not simplify to true or false, where 
 immediate-force-modep is enabled (see <a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a>).</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>These three annotations  <span class="v">if-intro</span>, <span class="v">case-split</span>, and 
 <span class="v">immed-forced</span>  may be used in proof output and summaries for 
 describing rule applications, as discussed below.  A fourth annotation, 
 <span class="v">forced</span>, may also be used in proof output to indicate the application of a 
 rule with hypothesis of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> &lt;hyp&gt;)</span> when <span class="v">&lt;hyp&gt;</span> did not 
 simplify to true or false, where immediate-force-modep is disabled (see <a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a>).  We don't consider such uses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> to be 
 splitters, because they do not cause case splits (though they do produce goals 
 to prove after lower-case ``q.e.d.'' is printed); see <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>There are three kinds of output affected by splitters, illustrated in turn 
 below using examples.</p> 
 
 <blockquote><p>(a) During the proof, <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a> and raw proof format (see 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-PROOF-FORMAT.html">set-raw-proof-format</a>) off<br> 
 
 (b) During the proof, <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a> or raw proof format on<br> 
 
 (c) <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">Summary</a></p></blockquote> 
 
 <p>Of course, (a) and (b) are skipped if proof output is inhibited, and (c) is 
 skipped if <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> output is inhibited; see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(a) During the proof, <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a> and raw proof format (see <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-PROOF-FORMAT.html">set-raw-proof-format</a>) off</p> 
 
 <p>With <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a> off (or when using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSOF.html">psof</a></span>, or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSOG.html">psog</a></span>) one normally gets an English commentary.  The 
 following output indicates that at least one application of each rule <span class="v">F</span> 
 and <span class="v">G</span> is of type <span class="v">if-intro</span>, at least one application of rules <span class="v">G</span> 
 and <span class="v">R1</span> are of type <span class="v">case-split</span>, and at least one application of rule 
 <span class="v">R3</span> is of type <span class="v">immed-forced</span>.  If <a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a> is off 
 then ``<span class="v">immed-forced</span>'' would be replaced by ``<span class="v">forced</span>''.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">This simplifies, using the :definitions F (<a href="ACL2____IF-INTRO.html">if-intro</a>), G (<a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a> and
if-intro) and H and the :rewrite rules R1, R2 (<a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a>), and
R3 (<a href="ACL2____IMMED-FORCED.html">immed-forced</a>), to the following two conjectures.</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that any such printing of ``<span class="v">forced</span>'' is done even if 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">splitter-output</a>)</span> is false.</p> 
 
 <p>(b) During the proof, <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a> or raw proof format on</p> 
 
 <p>With <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a> or raw proof format (see <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-PROOF-FORMAT.html">set-raw-proof-format</a>) 
 on, the proof output is abbreviated.  However, in these cases ``Splitter 
 Notes'' are printed so that one can still get important information to help 
 control large case splits (by disabling splitter rules as appropriate).  These 
 are printed at the point when a goal splits into subgoals.  Here, for example, 
 is the Splitter Note that corresponds to the output shown in (a) above.  It 
 shows the goal whose simplification has produced a split into more than one 
 subgoal, and it shows how many subgoals have been created.</p>

 <p>No indication for ``<span class="v">forced</span>'' is given for ``Splitter rules''.  (As 
 discussed earlier above, the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d hypotheses are not considered 
 relevant for determining splitter rule applications unless <a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a> is on.)</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude by giving the criteria for a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> or <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> rule application to be a splitter of type <span class="v">if-intro</span>.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Reporting of splitter rules is on, i.e., the value of <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SPLITTER-OUTPUT.html">splitter-output</a></span><span class="v">)</span> is true.</li> 
 
 <li>At least two subgoals are created, even before considering subgoals 
 generated by hypotheses that are calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The term to which the rule is applied is at the top level, rather than 
 being encountered when trying to establish the hypothesis of a rule.</li> 
 
 <li>The rule is a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule, a <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> rule, or a <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> rule.</li> 
 
 <li>There is a call of the function symbol <span class="v">IF</span> in the right-hand side of 
 the <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule; or, in the case of a <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> rule, in the 
 body of the definition; or, in the case of a <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> rule, in the result 
 of applying the metafunction.</li> 
 
 <li>There is a call of the function symbol <span class="v">IF</span> in the result of 
 rewriting: the right-hand side (for a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule), the definition 
 body (for a <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> rule), or the metafunction application (for a 
 <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> rule).</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Any rule application meeting the above criteria will be considered a 
 splitter of type <span class="v">if-intro</span>, even if the call does not actually cause a 
 case split.  For example, if you are proving <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (hyp x) (conc x))</span> 
 and rule R rewrites <span class="v">(hyp x)</span> to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (h1 x) (h2 x) nil)</span>, which is 
 really the term <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (h1 x) (h2 x))</span>, then R may be labeled as a splitter 
 rule.  If you want to find the causes of case-splitting, the list of 
 <span class="v">if-intro</span> splitters can help you narrow your search, but may include 
 irrelevant rules as well.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, note that you may see splits not attributed to splitters.  We 
 believe that this will be uncommon during simplification, though it can occur 
 for example when a call of <span class="v">IF</span> is in the body of a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> expression, 
 i.e., in a call of a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span> expression.  But splits caused by other 
 processes, notably destructor elimination (see <a href="ACL2____ELIM.html">elim</a>), will typically 
 not be attributed to splitters.</p>
