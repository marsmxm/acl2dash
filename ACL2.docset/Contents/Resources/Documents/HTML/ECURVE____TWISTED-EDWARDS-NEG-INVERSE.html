<p>Property that negation is left and right inverse for addition.</p><p>The proof is very simple on paper, 
     looking at the formula for addition: 
     the abscissa is (xy-yx)/\ldots, i.e. 0; 
     the ordinate is (yy+axx)/(1-dxxyy), 
     but yy+axx = 1+dxxyy because the point is on the curve, 
     and thus the ordinate is 1, 
     since the denominators are known to be non-0 in the addition formula.</p><p>The prime field rules get the part about the abscissa, 
     since it follows a simplifying rewriting pattern. 
     For the ordinate, enabling <span class="v">div</span> makese things worse, 
     splitting the fraction into two 
     (i.e. the direction of the rules is not appropriate 
     for this part of the proof). 
     Leaving <span class="v">div</span> disabled prevents that, 
     and the hypothesis that the point is on the curve 
     turns the numerator into more or less the same term as the denominator. 
     We use the rule <span class="v">div-of-same</span> to simplify that to 1, 
     but that rule requires the common term to be non-0. 
     We instantiate the general theorem about the denominator being non-0 
     to prove that the specific term is not 0. 
     Because of the term reordering done by the rules, 
     the general theorem about the denominator does not readily apply here; 
     but we need those rules to prove the abscissa to be 0, 
     so this is another case in which different part of the same proof 
     need different rules, necessitating some user guidance.</p><p>Once we prove the left inverse theorem, 
     the right inverse theorem follows by commutativity, 
     but we need a <span class="v">:use</span> hint because 
     commutativity rewrites in the other direction.</p>
