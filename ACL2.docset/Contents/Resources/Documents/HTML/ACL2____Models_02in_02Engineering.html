<p>Models in Engineering</p><p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/bridge.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <p>Frequently, engineers use mathematical models.  Use of such models 
 frequently lead to</p> 
 
 <p><b>better designs</b>,</p> 
 
 <p><b>faster completion of acceptable products</b>, and</p> 
 
 <p><b>reduced overall cost</b>,</p> 
 
 <p>because models allow the trained user to study the design before it is 
 built and analyze its properties.  Usually, testing and analyzing a model is 
 cheaper and faster than fabricating and refabricating the product.</p>
