<p>Renamings of variables and functions.</p><p>See <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____RENAMING-VARIABLES.html">renaming-variables</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____RENAMING-FUNCTIONS.html">renaming-functions</a></span>.</p><p>The renaming information is captured as 
     a list of pairs of identifiers 
     <span class="v">((a1 . b1) (a2 . b2) ...)</span> 
     such that <span class="v">a1</span>, <span class="v">a2</span>, etc. are all distinct 
     and that <span class="v">b1</span>, <span class="v">b2</span>, etc. are all distinct. 
     Technically, it is an alist with unique keys and unique values, 
     but we treat is as a list of pairs, 
     i.e. we do not use alist operations on them; 
     it is an injective alist, so its ``direction'' is unimportant. 
     Each pair <span class="v">(ai . bi)</span> describes a renaming between 
     the variable <span class="v">ai</span> in the old code 
     and the variable <span class="v">bi</span> in the new code. 
     The keys are the variables or functions in scope in the old code; 
     the values are the variables or functions in scope in the new code. 
     These facts hold because of the way the list is threaded through, 
     in the ACL2 code that defines the renaming relation. 
     These facts are formally explicated and proved as part of the 
     proof of static safety preservation of variable and function renaming.</p><p>The relative ordering of the pairs in the renaming list is irrelevant. 
     Because of the way the list is constructed, 
     the pairs happen to be ordered in reverse chronological order, 
     i.e. the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span> is the most recent. 
     From a point of view, 
     it may be better to use a set of pairs (which is also an omap), 
     to make it more explicit that the order does not matter. 
     However, with lists we can more readily use 
     functions like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NO-DUPLICATESP-EQUAL.html">no-duplicatesp-equal</a></span> and theorems about them.</p>
