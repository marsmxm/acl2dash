<p>ACL2 Version  2.9.1 (December, 2004) Notes</p><p> 
 (GCL only) A bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> has been fixed that could be 
 exploited to prove <span class="v">nil</span>, and hence is a soundness bug.  Thanks to Dave 
 Greve for sending us an example of a problem with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></span> (see below) 
 that led us to this discovery.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 now warns when <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></span> specifies <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> as the first 
 equivalence relation, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a> equal iff (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> x y) 2)</span>.  The 
 warning says that the rule has no effect because <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> already refines 
 all other equivalence relations.  Formerly, this caused an error unless 
 <span class="v">:event-name</span> was supplied (see <a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a>), and in fact the error was 
 a nasty raw Lisp error on GCL platforms due to some mishandling of packages by 
 ACL2 that has been fixed (see the paragraph about <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> 
 above).  Thanks to Dave Greve for sending a helpful example in his report of 
 this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) The build process was broken for GCL 2.6.0 (and perhaps some 
 earlier versions), and has been fixed.  Thanks to Jose Luis Ruiz-Reina for 
 bringing this problem to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) We have increased the hole size to at least 20% of max-pages, 
 which may eliminate some garbage collection at the expense of larger virtual 
 memory (not larger resident memory or larger image).  Thanks to Camm Maguire 
 for helpful explanations on this topic.</p> 
 
 <p>We have clarified the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> warning message that is printed during 
 evaluation of recursively-defined functions whose <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s have not been 
 verified, for example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Warning [Guards] in TOP-LEVEL:  Guard-checking may be inhibited
on some recursive calls of executable counterparts (i.e., in the ACL2
logic), including perhaps EVENLP.  To check guards on all recursive
calls:
  (<a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> :all)
To leave behavior unchanged except for inhibiting this message:
  (<a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> :nowarn)</pre> 
 
 <p>And, ACL2 no longer prints that message when the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> was 
 unspecified for the function or was specified as <span class="v">T</span>.  Thanks to Serita 
 Nelesen for bringing the latter issue to our attention.  Finally, ACL2 now 
 prints such a warning at most once during the evaluation of any top-level 
 form; thanks to Bill Young for pointing out this issue.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERBOSE-PSTACK.html">verbose-pstack</a></span> has been enhanced to allow specified 
 prover functions <b>not</b> to be traced.  See <a href="ACL2____VERBOSE-PSTACK.html">verbose-pstack</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span>, <span class="v">wet</span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-NON-LINEARP.html">set-non-linearp</a></span> to 
 <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>, and hence to the <span class="v">"</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-USER.html">ACL2-user</a></span><span class="v">"</span> 
 package.</p> 
 
 <p>The distributed book <span class="v">books/arithmetic-3/bind-free/integerp.lisp</span> has 
 been modified in order to prevent potential looping; specifically, the 
 definition of function <span class="v">reduce-integerp-+-fn-1</span>.  Thanks to Robert Krug for 
 providing this change.</p> 
 
 <p>A small improvement was made in the <span class="v">wet</span> failure message when the error 
 occurs during translation to internal form.  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 pointing out the obscurity of some <span class="v">wet</span> error messages.</p> 
 
 <p>We have improved ACL2's evaluation mechanism for the function 
 <span class="v">bad-atom&lt;=</span>, which now is specified to return <span class="v">nil</span> if neither argument 
 is a so-called ``bad atom'' (as recognized by function <span class="v">bad-atom</span>).  The 
 following events had caused a hard error, for example.  (We're sorry that 
 <span class="v">bad-atom</span> and <span class="v">bad-atom&lt;=</span> are not documented, but we also consider it 
 unlikely that anyone needs such documentation; otherwise, please contact the 
 implementors.)</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) (bad-atom&lt;= x y))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> bar (x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) (foo x y))
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (bar 3 4) 7))</pre> 
 
 <p>We have also changed the guard on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ALPHORDER.html">alphorder</a></span> to require both 
 arguments to be atoms.</p> 
 
 <p>For forms <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> x)</span> that are skipped during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, or 
 during the second pass of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, ACL2 
 had nevertheless checked that <span class="v">x</span> is a legal event form.  This is no longer 
 the case.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> now does non-linear arithmetic when appropriate. 
 It had formerly ignored <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-NON-LINEARP.html">set-non-linearp</a></span> executed in the ACL2 command 
 loop.</p> 
 
 <p>Incremental releases are now supported.  See <a href="ACL2____VERSION.html">version</a> and {obsolete 
 after Version 4.3} set-tainted-okp.  Thanks to Hanbing Liu for discovering a 
 flaw in our original design.</p> 
 
 <p>The pattern-matching algorithm for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules has been 
 made slightly more restrictive, thanks to a suggestion and examples from 
 Robert Krug.  For example, previously one could get an infinite loop as 
 follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> foo (x) t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> foo-axiom
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 x))
         (foo x)))
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (foo 0)) ; or replace 0 by any integer!</pre> 
 
 <p>That is because the term <span class="v">(foo 0)</span> was considered to match against the 
 pattern <span class="v">(foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 x))</span>, with <span class="v">x</span> bound to <span class="v">-1</span>.  While such matching 
 is sound, it leads to an infinite loop since it allows <span class="v">foo-axiom</span> to 
 rewrite <span class="v">(foo 0)</span> to <span class="v">(foo -1)</span>, and then <span class="v">(foo -1)</span> to <span class="v">(foo
 -2)</span>, and so on.  The fix is to insist that the new value, in this case 
 <span class="v">-1</span>, is no larger in size according to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a></span> than the old 
 value, in this case <span class="v">0</span>.  Since that test fails, the match is considered to 
 fail and the loop no longer occurs.  An analogous fix has been made for 
 multiplication, where now we only match when the new term is still a non-zero 
 integer.  That change avoids a loop here.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> foo (x) t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> foo-axiom
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 2 x))
         (foo x)))
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (foo 0)) ; or try (<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (foo 4))</pre> 
 
 <p>Added macro <span class="v">find-lemmas</span> in <span class="v">books/misc/find-lemmas.lisp</span> (see brief 
 documentation there) for finding all lemmas that mention all function symbols 
 in a given list.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Restrict</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> now work for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> rules, 
 though they continue to be ignored by the preprocessor and hence you may want 
 to use <span class="v">:do-not '(preprocess)</span> with any restrict hints.  Thanks to John 
 Matthews for pointing out the lack of support for <span class="v">:definition</span> rules in 
 <span class="v">:restrict</span> hints.</p> 
 
 <p>Some books have been updated.  In particular, there is a new directory 
 <span class="v">books/workshops/2004/</span> in workshops distribution, for the 2004 ACL2 
 workshop.  There is also a new version of Jared Davis's ordered sets library, 
 formerly in <span class="v">books/finite-set-theory/osets-0.81/</span> but now in 
 <span class="v">books/finite-set-theory/osets/</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in the (under-the-hood) raw Lisp definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span>, which had been causing a warning in CMU Common Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>[Technical improvements related to the use of ``<span class="v">make dependencies</span>'' 
 for certifying distributed books:]<br> File <span class="v">books/Makefile-generic</span> 
 now does a better job with ``<span class="v">make dependencies</span>,'' specifically with 
 respect to handling <span class="v">*.acl2</span> files and handling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 commands with <span class="v">:dir :system</span>.  Regarding the latter, suppose for example 
 that book <span class="v">basic.lisp</span> contains the line:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "arithmetic/top-with-meta" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
 <p>Then <span class="v">make dependencies</span> would generate the following line:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">basic.cert: $(ACL2_SRC_BOOKS)/arithmetic/top-with-meta.cert</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, if <span class="v">:dir :system</span> is used with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, the 
 corresponding <span class="v">Makefile</span> should define the variable <span class="v">ACL2_SRC_BOOKS</span>.  A 
 standard <span class="v">Makefile</span> header for a books directory could thus be as 
 follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"># The following variable should represent the ACL2 source directory.  It is the
# only variable in this Makefile that may need to be edited.
ACL2_SRC = ../../../../../..

ACL2_SRC_BOOKS = $(ACL2_SRC)/books
include $(ACL2_SRC_BOOKS)/Makefile-generic
ACL2 = $(ACL2_SRC)/saved_acl2h</pre> 
 
 <p>Finally, the ``<span class="v">-s</span>'' flag may now be omitted when running ``<span class="v">make
 dependencies</span>.''</p>
