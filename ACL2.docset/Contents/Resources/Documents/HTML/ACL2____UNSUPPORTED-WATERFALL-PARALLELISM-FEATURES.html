<p>Proof features not supported with waterfall-parallelism enabled</p><p>For a general introduction to ACL2(p), an experimental extension of 
 ACL2 that supports parallel execution and proof, see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>. 
 Please note that although this extension is usable and, we hope, robust in its 
 behavior, there are still known issues to address beyond those listed 
 explicitly below.  While we expect ACL2(p) to perform correctly, it may never 
 have the same level of attention to correctness as is given to ACL2; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>, specifically the ``IMPORTANT NOTE'' there.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we list proof features of ACL2 that are not yet supported when 
 parallel execution is enabled for the primary ACL2 proof process, generally 
 known as ``the waterfall'', typically by calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Please note that this topic is limited to the case that such waterfall 
 parallelism is enabled.  We believe that all ACL2 proof procedures are 
 supported when waterfall parallelism is disabled, even in executables that 
 support parallelism (see <a href="ACL2____COMPILING-ACL2P.html">compiling-ACL2p</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Without a trust tag (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>): We support <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>s, <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>, and <a href="ACL2____CUSTOM-KEYWORD-HINTS.html">custom-keyword-hints</a> 
 that do not modify <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, but we do not permit <a href="ACL2____OVERRIDE-HINTS.html">override-hints</a>, 
 regardless of whether they modify state.  With a trust tag, the user can use 
 <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>s that modify state and can also use <a href="ACL2____OVERRIDE-HINTS.html">override-hints</a> (see <a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM-HACKS-ENABLED.html">set-waterfall-parallelism-hacks-enabled</a> for a 
 convenient mechanism for adding a trust tag).  See <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLES-AND-PARALLELISM.html">error-triples-and-parallelism</a> for a discussion of how to avoid modifying 
 state in such situations.  Regardless of whether a trust tag is active: We do 
 not support checkers of <a href="ACL2____CUSTOM-KEYWORD-HINTS.html">custom-keyword-hints</a> to be anything but the 
 default checker.</p> 
 
 <p>GNU Make versions 3.81 and 3.82 formerly caused a lot of problems (version 
 3.80 somewhat less so), at least on Linux, when certifying books with ACL2 
 built on a host Lisp of CCL using `make'.  CCL was updated around March 23, 
 2011 to fix this problem, so if you get segfaults (for example) with CCL, try 
 updating your CCL installation.</p> 
 
 <p>Book certification should generally work but may present some issues, 
 including the following.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The standard `make'-based process for book certification will 
 not use <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">waterfall-parallelism</a>, which is disabled by default (even when 
 <a href="ACL2____COMPILING-ACL2P.html">compiling-ACL2p</a> by using the <span class="v">ACL2_PAR</span> flag).  See <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION.html">books-certification</a> and see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION-CLASSIC.html">books-certification-classic</a>, which explain 
 that <a href="ACL2____ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION.html">ACL2-customization</a> files are ignored during that process unless 
 specified explicitly on the command line or in the environment.</li> 
 
 <li>A book certified with ACL2(p) might subsequently cause an error when 
 included with ACL2.  As of this writing, however, we have only seen this for a 
 book in which <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHEORY-STATIC.html">deftheory-static</a></span> is used.</li> 
 
 <li>In general, ACL2(p) is primarily intended to support more rapid 
 interactive development.  While we are unaware of an unsoundness likely to 
 affect an ACL2(p) user, we suggest using ACL2 for final book certification, 
 rather than ACL2(p), to lower the risk of unsound book 
 certification.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Proof output can contain repeated printing of the same subgoal name.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">Gag-mode</a> isn't officially supported, although it has proved helpful 
 to use ACL2(p) in conjunction with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> t)</span> (because this setting 
 suppresses the output that occurs outside the waterfall).  This being said, 
 ACL2(p) also prints key checkpoints (for example see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-KEY-CHECKPOINTS.html">introduction-to-key-checkpoints</a>), but with a notion of ``key checkpoint'' 
 that does not take into account whether the goal is later proved by induction. 
 See <a href="ACL2____ACL2P-KEY-CHECKPOINTS.html">ACL2p-key-checkpoints</a> for further explanation of these key 
 checkpoints.  Note that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a></span> is also not supported.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a></span> utility is not supported.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a></span> utility is not supported.</p> 
 
 <p>Tracking for <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING-REPORTS.html">forward-chaining-reports</a> is not supported (see <a href="ACL2____SET-FC-CRITERIA.html">set-fc-criteria</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Time limits (see <a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a>) aren't supported.</p> 
 
 <p>The timing information printed at the end of a proof attempt, which is 
 intended to represent cpu time (not wall-clock time), may be somewhat 
 inaccurate when <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">waterfall-parallelism</a> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  Consider using 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span> to obtain timing information.</p> 
 
 <p>Use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a></span>s at your own risk.  Although they use locks, there has 
 been some concern that they may cause race conditions.  They are used in 
 ACL2(p) source code (macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OBSERVATION-CW.html">observation-cw</a></span>), however, thus we have hope 
 that they perform acceptably.</p> 
 
 <p>Output specific to <span class="v">:OR</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> is disabled.</p> 
 
 <p>Proof trees are likely not to work as originally designed.</p> 
 
 <p>The use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a></span> may not fully inhibit proof 
 output.</p> 
 
 <p>Reporting of <a href="ACL2____SPLITTER.html">splitter</a> rules is currently unsupported when 
 waterfall-parallelism is on.</p> 
 
 <p>Interrupting a proof attempt is not yet properly supported.  At a minimum, 
 interrupts are trickier with waterfall parallelism enabled.  For one, the user 
 typically needs to issue the interrupt twice before the proof attempt is 
 actually interrupted.  Additionally, on rare occasions the theorem is 
 registered as proved, even though the prover did not finish the proof.  If 
 this occurs, issue a <span class="v">:u</span> (see <a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a>) and you will likely be at a 
 stable state.</p> 
 
 <p>Also with regards to interrupting a proof attempt, sometimes the user may 
 need to issue a <span class="v">:q</span> and <span class="v">lp</span> to reset properly the parallelism 
 implementation to a stable state.  The primary symptom that the user is 
 experiencing this issue is that threads will continue to compute in the 
 background, even though there should be no proof attempt in progress.  The 
 user can observe this symptom by examining the CPU utilization of their ACL2 
 process, for example on Linux/Unix with the shell process <span class="v">top</span>.  Lisp 
 usage greater than a few percent is indicative of this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Because of how ACL2 <a href="ACL2____ARRAYS.html">arrays</a> are designed, the user may find that, in 
 practice, ACL2 arrays work (but perhaps with some <a href="ACL2____SLOW-ARRAY-WARNING.html">slow-array-warning</a> 
 messages).  However, we are aware of race conditions that can cause 
 problems.</p> 
 
 <p>Instead of dynamically monitoring rewrites, <a href="ACL2____DMR.html">dmr</a> instead dynamically 
 outputs information helpful for debugging the performance of proof 
 parallelism.  The instructions concerning how to see this debugging 
 information are the same as the instructions for enabling <a href="ACL2____DMR.html">dmr</a> mode.</p> 
 
 <p>If you are working with LispWorks 6.0 or 6.0.1, then you may see messages 
 about misaligned conses.  The state of the system may be corrupted after such 
 a message has been printed.  This LispWorks bug is fixed in LispWorks 6.1.</p> 
 
 <p>The waterfall parallelism mode <span class="v">:resource-and-timing-based</span> is not fully 
 supported when the host Lisp is other than CCL.  It may work, but we have not 
 attempted to address a potential race condition.</p> 
 
 <p>Proof output for splitter rules (see <a href="ACL2____SPLITTER.html">splitter</a>) is currently 
 unsupported when waterfall-parallelism is enabled.</p> 
 
 <p>Profiling may cause proofs to hang when waterfall-parallelism is enabled 
 (GitHub Issue #638).</p> 
 
 <p>During proofs with <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">waterfall-parallelism</a> enabled, you may see 
 messages about <span class="v">"Fast alist discipline"</span> violations, even when using 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-GET.html">hons-get</a></span> appropriately.  This can happen because each thread uses its 
 own underlying hash-table for fast access by <span class="v">hons-get</span>, but typical 
 top-level calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-ACONS.html">hons-acons</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-FAST-ALIST.html">make-fast-alist</a></span> only affect 
 that main thread's hash-table.  You can use <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-SLOW-ALIST-ACTION.html">set-slow-alist-action</a> nil)</span> 
 to eliminate this warning entirely; see <a href="ACL2____SLOW-ALIST-WARNING.html">slow-alist-warning</a>.</p>
