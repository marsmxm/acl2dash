<p>Definitions and lemmas about logical operations on integers.</p><p>The books <a href="ACL2____LOGOPS-DEFINITIONS.html">logops-definitions</a> and <a href="ACL2____LOGOPS-LEMMAS.html">logops-lemmas</a> 
contain a theory of the logical operations on numbers defined by CLTL (Section 
12.7), and a portable implementation of the CLTL byte manipulation 
functions (Section 12.8).  These books also extend the CLTL logical operations 
and byte manipulation theory with a few new definitions, lemmas supporting 
those definitions, and useful macros.</p> 
 
<p>These books were developed as a basis for the formal specification and 
verification of hardware, where integers are used to represent binary signals 
and busses.  These books should be general enough, however, to be used as a 
basis for reasoning about packed data structures, bit-encoded sets, and other 
applications of logical operations on integers.</p>
