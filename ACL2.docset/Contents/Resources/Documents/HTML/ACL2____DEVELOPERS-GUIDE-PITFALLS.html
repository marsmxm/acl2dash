<p>Avoiding potentially common pitfalls</p><p>This topic is initially little more than a stub.  It is a place to 
 list things to keep in mind in order to avoid potentially common mistakes.</p> 
 
 <p>It may be tempting to ignore the <a href="ACL2____TAG-TREE.html">tag-tree</a> (ttree) returned by a 
 function.  But tag-trees may contain <span class="v">assumption</span> records, stored under the 
 tag <span class="v">'assumption</span>, that record <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d assumptions to be proved 
 later (in forcing rounds or, in the case of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMMEDIATE-FORCE-MODEP.html">immediate-force-modep</a></span>, more immediately).  So it can be unsound to ignore 
 tag-trees unless they are sure not to contain assumptions (see 
 <span class="v">assumption-free-ttreep</span>).</p>
