<p>How to use <span class="v">cert-flags</span> to control the options that will be passed 
to the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> command.  You'll need this to allow the use of <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">trust tags</a>, <a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a>, <a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a>s, 
and so forth.</p><p>By default, ACL2's <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> command does not allow your 
books to use unsafe features that can easily lead to unsoundness.  For 
instance, your book may not skip proofs, add arbitrary axioms, or use trust 
tags to smash raw Lisp definitions.</p> 
 
<p>However, these restrictions can be lifted by giving <span class="v">certify-book</span> 
options such as <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp t</span> and <span class="v">:ttags :all</span>.  In such cases 
the resulting certificate is annotated to reflect that it is less trustworthy 
and <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> may print warnings about the book or even reject it 
when given suitable options.  See <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> and <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> 
for details.</p> 
 
<p>By default <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will similarly disallow these unsafe features.  More 
precisely, the default command it uses to certify books is looks like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> "foo" ? t)</pre> 
 
<p>If you want to permit your book to use trust tags, skipped proofs, etc., 
you'll need to tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> that you want to give different arguments to 
<span class="v">certify-book</span>.</p> 
 
<p>You can do this on a per-book or per-directory basis by adding a special 
comment into the corresponding <span class="v">.acl2</span> file.  If you don't know what an 
<span class="v">.acl2</span> file is, see <a href="BUILD____PRE-CERTIFY-BOOK-COMMANDS.html">pre-certify-book-commands</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Example: to allow all trust tags, you could use a comment like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">; cert-flags: ? t :ttags :all</pre> 
 
<p>Example: to allow trust tags and skip-proofs, you could use:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">; cert-flags: ? t :ttags :all :skip-proofs-okp t</pre> 
 
<p>Rules of thumb:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Your <span class="v">cert-flags</span> should probably start with <span class="v">? t</span>.</li> 
 
<li>Even if you have a long list of :ttags, keep them <b>on one line</b>.  A 
dumb perl script is reading this, after all.</li> 
 
<li>You should probably <b>not</b> use arguments like <span class="v">:acl2x</span>, 
<span class="v">:write-port</span>, or <span class="v">:pcert</span>.</li> 
 
</ul>
