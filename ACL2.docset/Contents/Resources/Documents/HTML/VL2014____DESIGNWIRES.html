<p>Introduce <span class="v">VL_DESIGN_WIRE</span> annotations that say which wires/regs 
were in the original Verilog modules.</p><p>This transform is ordinarily run very early in the transformation 
sequence by <a href="VL2014____ANNOTATE.html">annotate</a>.  We simply extend every variable declaration with 
a <span class="v">VL_DESIGN_WIRE</span> <a href="VL2014____VL-ATTS-P.html">attribute</a>.  This 
attribute can later be used to distinguish between:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>wires that are really present and visible in the design, and</li> 
<li>wires that VL added in <a href="VL2014____TRANSFORMS.html">transforms</a> like <a href="VL2014____SPLIT.html">split</a> and <a href="VL2014____OCCFORM.html">occform</a>.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>That is, when temporary wires are added to the module by subsequent VL 
transforms, they will not have this attribute.  Hence, you can check for this 
attribute to tell whether a variable was in the original design.</p>
