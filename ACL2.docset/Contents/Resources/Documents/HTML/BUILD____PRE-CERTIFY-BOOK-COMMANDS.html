<p>How to add commands to be executed before calling <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>.  You'll need this to use ACL2 features like <a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> and 
<a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a>.</p><h3>Background: Pre <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> Commands</h3> 
 
<p>ACL2 commands like <a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> can't be embedded within books.  Instead, 
when using raw ACL2 to certify books, you typically define the package before 
issuing the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> command.  The <a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> command then 
becomes part of the book's <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">ACL2::portcullis</a>.</p> 
 
<p>For example, here is how to successfully certify a book with its own 
package, using raw ACL2:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cat mybook.lisp
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "MY-PACKAGE")
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x 1))

$ acl2
ACL2 !&gt; (<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "MY-PACKAGE"
          (<a href="ACL2____UNION-EQ.html">union-eq</a> *acl2-exports*
                    *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*))
ACL2 !&gt; (<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> "mybook" ?)</pre> 
 
<p>If this doesn't make sense, please see the documentation for <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>, 
especially see <a href="ACL2____BOOK-EXAMPLE.html">ACL2::book-example</a> which explains something like the 
above in far greater detail.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Individual <span class="v">.acl2</span> Files</h3> 
 
<p>For <span class="v">cert.pl</span> to certify books with packages, it needs to be able to find 
these extra <span class="v">defpkg</span> commands that can't go directly into the book.</p> 
 
<p>If you are using only packages from existing libraries, these should be 
dealt with automatically by the build system, which loads the portcullis 
 (<span class="v">.port</span> file) of each included book before certifying a book.  (To defeat 
this mechanism, add a comment containing "no_port" at the end of the line of 
each include-book whose portculli you don't want.) However, if you are defining 
a new package, you need to know how to put it in your book's portcullis.</p> 
 
<p>The most basic way to tell <span class="v">cert.pl</span> how to certify a file like 
<span class="v">mybook.lisp</span> is to put the <span class="v">defpkg</span> form into a corresponding file, 
named <span class="v">mybook.acl2</span>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cat mybook.acl2
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "MY-PACKAGE"
  (<a href="ACL2____UNION-EQ.html">union-eq</a> *acl2-exports*
            *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*))
;; no certify-book command, unlike in legacy files for Makefile-generic</pre> 
 
<p>At this point, we can simply run:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cert.pl mybook
ACL2 executable is ...
System books directory is ...
Making .../mybook.cert on 24-Oct-2013 09:25:03
Successfully built .../my-book.cert
-rw-rw-r-- 1 jared logic 513 Oct 24 09:25 mybook.cert</pre> 
 
<p>If you inspect the resulting <span class="v">mybook.cert.out</span> output log, you'll see 
that these instructions that were picked up from the <span class="v">.acl2</span> file:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">$ cat mybook.cert.out
-*- Mode: auto-revert -*-
...
; instructions from .acl2 file mybook.acl2:
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "MY-PACKAGE"
  (<a href="ACL2____UNION-EQ.html">union-eq</a> *acl2-exports*
            *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*))
...</pre> 
 
<p>Furthermore, if you inspect <span class="v">mybook.cert</span>, you'll see that defpkg form 
replicated in the portcullis section of the certificate.  In fact, all the 
books that include your book (transitively) or that also load the same package 
will also replicate this form in their portculli.  This can be a problem 
because including multiple books depending on this package requires checking 
many times that this defpkg form is redundant, which can actually add up to a 
significant performance problem.  We suggest using the discipline described in 
<a href="ACL2____WORKING-WITH-PACKAGES.html">ACL2::working-with-packages</a> instead.</p> 
 
<h3>Directory-Wide <span class="v">cert.acl2</span> Files</h3> 
 
<p>It's very common for all of the books in a directory to want to use the same 
packages.  Instead of setting up a corresponding <span class="v">.acl2</span> file for every 
single book, it is often much more convenient to use a special, directory-wide 
<span class="v">.acl2</span> file, called <span class="v">cert.acl2</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Here is how <span class="v">cert.pl</span> chooses the <span class="v">.acl2</span> file to use when you ask 
it to certify <span class="v">foo.lisp</span>:</p> 
 
<ol> 
<li>First, if a file named <span class="v">foo.acl2</span> exists, then it will be used.</li> 
<li>Else, if a file named <span class="v">cert.acl2</span> exists, then it will be used.</li> 
<li>Otherwise, no <span class="v">.acl2</span> files will be used; no pre <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> 
    commands will be given.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p>In the typical case, then, where you have a whole directory of books that 
are all supposed to be in some package, you just need a single <span class="v">cert.acl2</span> 
file that gets that <a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> form loaded.</p>
