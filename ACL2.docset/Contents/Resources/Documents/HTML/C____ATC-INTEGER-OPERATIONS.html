<p>A model of C integer operations for ATC.</p><p>We define ACL2 functions that model C operations on 
     the integer types supported in our model, 
     namely the standard unsigned and signed integers, except <span class="v">_Bool</span>.</p><p>We introduce functions <span class="v">&lt;type&gt;-&lt;base&gt;-const</span> 
     to construct integer constants. 
     Following [C:6.4.4.1], these have non-negative values 
     and may have only certain integer types, 
     namely those with the same rank as <span class="v">int</span> or higher. 
     Thus we introduce three functions for each integer type in those ranks, 
     one function per possible base (decimal, octal, hexadecimal). 
     Each takes a natural number as argument, 
     which the guard further constrains to be representable in the type. 
     The three functions for the three bases have the same definition, 
     but they represent syntactically different constants in C.</p><p>We introduce functions <span class="v">boolean-from-&lt;type&gt;</span> 
     to turn C integers into ACL2 booleans, 
     i.e. to test whether the integers are not zero. 
     These are used to represent shallowly embedded tests. 
     We introduce a function for each integer type.</p><p>We introduce functions <span class="v">&lt;type&gt;-integer-value</span> 
     to turn C integers into ACL2 integers. 
     These are used as operands of certain C operations 
     whose result does not depend on the C type of the operand, 
     but rather just on its (mathematical) integer value. 
     We define one function for each integer type. 
     Even though these functions are essentially synonyms of 
     the deconstructors of the fixtypes of the integer values, 
     having a separate function provides more abstraction, 
     should the fixtype representation be changed in the future.</p><p>We introduce a single function <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT-FROM-BOOLEAN.html">sint-from-boolean</a></span> 
     to turn ACL2 booleans into the <span class="v">int</span> 0 or 1 (for false and true). 
     This function is used in the ACL2 representation of 
     non-strict C conjunctions <span class="v">&amp;&amp;</span> and disjunctions <span class="v">||</span>, 
     which always return <span class="v">int</span> 0 or 1 [C:6.5.13/3] [C:6.5.14/3]. 
     We do not need similar functions for other types, 
     because the 0 or 1 are always <span class="v">int</span> 
     for operations like <span class="v">&amp;&amp;</span> and <span class="v">||</span>.</p><p>We introduce functions for the unary and strict pure binary operators, 
     as detailed below. 
     We do not introduce functions for the non-strict binary operators, 
     because those are modeled via ACL2's <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a></span>, 
     which are also non-strict. 
     We do not introduce functions for the non-pure binary operators 
     (i.e. assignments), because they are modeled differently in ACL2.</p><p>For each unary operator, we introduce a function for each integer type. 
     The function takes an argument of that integer type, 
     and returns a result of possibly different type. 
     For all the unary integer operators except <span class="v">!</span>, 
     C promotes operands [C:6.3.1.1/2] to types of rank <span class="v">int</span> or higher, 
     and that is also the result of the operator. 
     C does not promote the operand of <span class="v">!</span>; 
     this operator always returns an <span class="v">int</span>.</p><p>For all the binary integer operators 
     except <span class="v">&lt;&lt;</span>, <span class="v">&gt;&gt;</span>, <span class="v">&amp;&amp;</span>, and <span class="v">||</span>, 
     C subjects the operands to the usual arithmetic conversions [C:6.3.1.8], 
     which involve promoting them [C:6.3.1.1/2] 
     and turning them into a common type of rank <span class="v">int</span> or higher: 
     thus, it suffices to define functions for operands 
     of the same type of rank <span class="v">int</span> or higher. 
     C also promotes, individually, the operands of <span class="v">&lt;&lt;</span> and <span class="v">&gt;&gt;</span>, 
     but without turning them into a common type; 
     while the type of the first operand affects the result, 
     only the (mathematical) integer value of the second operand does.</p><p>When the exact result of an aritmetic operation on signed integers 
     is not representable in the signed integer type, 
     the behavior is undefined [C:6.5/5]: 
     our functions for signed integer operations 
     have guards requiring the results to be representable.</p><p>Arithmetic on unsigned integers is modular [C:6.2.5/9].</p><p>The right operand of a signed shift operator 
     must be non-negative and below the bit size of the left operand 
     [C:6.5.7/3]. 
     The left operand, when signed, must be non-negative. 
     These requirements are captured in the guards.</p><p>For division and remainder, 
     the guard also requires the divisor to be non-zero.</p><p>The relational and equality operators, 
     as well as the logical negation, conjunction, and disjunction operations, 
     always return <span class="v">int</span>, regardless of the types of the operands.</p><p>The bitwise operations assume a two's complement representation, 
     which is consistent with <a href="C____INTEGER-FORMATS.html">our model of integer values</a>; these operations depend on the C representation of integers [C:6.5/4].</p>
