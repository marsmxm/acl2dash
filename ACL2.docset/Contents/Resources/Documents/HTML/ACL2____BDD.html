<p>Ordered binary decision diagrams with rewriting</p><p>Note.  The ACL2 bdd capability has been essentially superseded by 
 GL; see <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs, often simply called BDDs) are a 
 technique, originally published by Randy Bryant, for the efficient 
 simplification of Boolean expressions.  In ACL2 we combine this technique with 
 rewriting to handle arbitrary ACL2 terms that can represent not only Boolean 
 values, but non-Boolean values as well.  In particular, we provide a setting 
 for deciding equality of bit vectors (lists of Boolean values).</p> 
 
 <p>An introduction to BDDs for the automated reasoning community may be found 
 in ``Introduction to the OBDD Algorithm for the ATP Community'' by J Moore, 
 <i>Journal of Automated Reasoning</i> (1994), pp. 33â€“45.  (This paper 
 also appears as Technical Report #84 from Computational Logic, Inc.)</p> 
 
 <p>Further information about BDDs in ACL2 can be found in the subtopics of 
 this <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> section.  In particular, see <a href="ACL2____BDD-INTRODUCTION.html">bdd-introduction</a> 
 for a good starting place that provides a number of examples.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> for a description of <span class="v">:bdd</span> hints.  For quick 
 reference, here is an example; but only the <span class="v">:vars</span> part of the hint is 
 required, as explained in the documentation for <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  The values 
 shown are the defaults.</p>
