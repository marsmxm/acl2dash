<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____STOP-PROOF-TREE">Click for Stop-proof-tree in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Stop displaying proof trees during proofs</p><p>Also see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> and see <a href="ACL2____START-PROOF-TREE.html">start-proof-tree</a>.  Note 
 that <span class="v">:stop-proof-tree</span> works by adding <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a></span> to the 
 <span class="v">inhibit-output-lst</span>; see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Proof tree displays are explained in the documentation for <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.  <span class="v">:Stop-proof-tree</span> causes proof tree display to be turned 
 off.</p> 
 
 <p>It is permissible to submit the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a>)</span> during a break. 
 Thus, you can actually turn off proof tree display in the middle of a proof by 
 interrupting ACL2 and submitting the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a>)</span> in raw 
 Lisp.</p>
