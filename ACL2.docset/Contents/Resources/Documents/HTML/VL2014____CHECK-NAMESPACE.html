<p>A check for basic, incorrect constructs like name clashes.</p><p>This is a like <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-CHECK-REASONABLE.html">vl-module-check-reasonable</a>, but is more 
appropriate for linting.  The main difference is that, here, we don't complain 
about perfectly valid Verilog constructs merely because they aren't supported 
by our transformation to <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>.  For instance, we don't support event 
declarations in E, but that's no reason to complain about them when 
linting.</p>
