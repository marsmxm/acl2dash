<p>Conventions associated with book names</p><pre class="code">Examples:
"list-processing"
"/usr/home/smith/my-arith"</pre> 
 
 <p>Book names are string constants that can be elaborated into file names.  We 
 elaborate book names by concatenating the ``connected book directory'' (see 
 <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>) string on the left and some ``extension,'' such as <span class="v">".lisp"</span>, 
 on the right.  However, the connected book directory is not added if the book 
 name itself already represents an absolute file name.  Furthermore, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> temporarily reset the connected book 
 directory to be the directory of the book being processed.  This allows <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> forms to use file names without explicit mention of the 
 enclosing book's directory.  This in turn allows <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> (together with 
 those that they include, using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>) to be moved between 
 directories while maintaining their certification and utility.</p> 
 
 <p>You may wish to read elsewhere for details of ACL2 file name conventions 
 (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>), for a discussion of the filename that is the result of 
 the elaboration described here (see <a href="ACL2____FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a>), and for details of 
 the concept of the connected book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>).  For details of 
 how <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> (see <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>) and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> 
 (see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>) use these concepts, see below.</p> 
 
 <p>Often a book name is simply the familiar name of the file.  (See <a href="ACL2____FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a> for discussion of the notions of ``directory string,'' 
 ``familiar name,'' and ``extension''.  These concepts are not on the guided 
 tour through <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> and you should read them separately.)  However, it 
 is permitted for book names to include a directory or part of a directory 
 name.  Book names never include the extension, since ACL2 must routinely tack 
 several different extensions onto the name during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  For 
 example, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> uses the <span class="v">".lisp"</span>, <span class="v">".cert"</span> and 
 possibly the <span class="v">".o"</span> or <span class="v">".lbin"</span> extensions of the book name.</p> 
 
 <p>Book names are elaborated into full file names by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>.  This elaboration is sensitive to the ``connected book 
 directory.'' The connected book directory is an absolute filename string (see 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>) that is part of the ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.  (You may wish to see 
 <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a> and to see <a href="ACL2____SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a> â€” note that these are not on the 
 guided tour).  If a book name is an absolute filename string, ACL2 elaborates 
 it simply by appending the desired extension to the right.  If a book name is 
 a relative filename string, ACL2 appends the connected book directory on the 
 left and the desired extension on the right.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that it is possible that the book name includes some partial 
 specification of the directory.  For example, if the connected book directory 
 is <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/"</span> then the book name <span class="v">"project/task-1/arith"</span> 
 is a book name that will be elaborated to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp".</pre> 
 
 <p>Observe that while the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in this <span class="v">"arith"</span> book are being 
 processed the connected book directory will temporarily be set to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/".</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, if the book requires other <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>, e.g.,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "naturals")</pre> 
 
 <p>then it is not necessary to specify the directory on which they reside 
 provided that directory is the same as the superior book.</p> 
 
 <p>This inheritance of the connected book directory and its use to elaborate 
 the names of inferior <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> makes it possible to move <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> and 
 their inferiors to new directories, provided they maintain the same relative 
 relationship.  It is even possible to move with ease whole collections of 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> to different filesystems that use a different operating system 
 than the one under which the original certification was performed.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">".cert"</span> extension of a book, if it exists, is presumed to 
 contain the most recent <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for the book.  See <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> (or, if you are on the guided tour, wait until the tour gets 
 there).</p>
