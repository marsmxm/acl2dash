<p>Main transform for synthesizing simple latch-like <span class="v">always</span> blocks 
into instances of primitive latch modules.</p><p>This is a sort of back-end transform that does the final conversion 
of already-simplified <span class="v">always</span> statements into latches.  This is quite 
similar to how the <a href="VL2014____OCCFORM.html">occform</a> transform converts Verilog expressions into 
explicit instances of generated modules, except that here we are converting 
<span class="v">always</span> statements into instances of latch modules.</p> 
 
<p>Notes:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We support only a very small set of <span class="v">always</span> statements here; see <a href="VL2014____LATCHCODE.html">latchcode</a>.  Typically you will want to run other statement-simplifying 
transformations first to get them into this form; see <a href="VL2014____ALWAYS-TOP.html">always-top</a>.</li> 
 
<li>We expect expressions to be sized so that we can tell which sizes of latch 
modules to introduce.</li> 
 
<li>We expect modules to be free of <span class="v">initial</span> statements, otherwise we could 
produce invalid modules when we convert registers into nets.</li> 
 
<li>This is a best-effort style transform which will leave unsupported 
<span class="v">always</span> blocks alone.  We usually follow up with <a href="VL2014____ELIMALWAYS.html">elimalways</a> to throw 
out (with fatal warnings) modules whose <span class="v">always</span> blocks were not 
supported.</li>
