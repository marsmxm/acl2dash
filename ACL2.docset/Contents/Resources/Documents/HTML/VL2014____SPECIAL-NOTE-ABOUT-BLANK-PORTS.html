<p>Clarification regarding how empty module port lists are handled.</p><p>The Verilog grammar contains a nasty ambiguity in handling 
arguments for module instances due to the possibility of "blank ports". 
Blank ports may be used to model an instantiation where a port is not 
connected to anything.  For instance, after writing</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module m (a, b, c) ; ... ; endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>In another module we may instantiate M, and not connect anything to port b, 
by writing something like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">m my_instance (a, , c);</pre> 
 
<p>In the grammar, this causes the following ambiguity.  Let Epsilon be the 
empty production, and note that:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Epsilon may be a valid ordered_port_connection.  I think of this as a 
    "blank port."  Hence, list_of_port_connections may be Epsilon, and such a 
    think might be thought of as a singleton list containing a blank port.</li> 
 
<li>On the other hand, module_instance is said to take an OPTIONAL 
    list_of_port_connections.  If we omit the list_of_port_connections 
    entirely, we might think of it it as an empty list containing no ports.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>So in the context of a module instance, what does Epsilon mean?  Is it an 
empty list containing no ports, or is it a singleton list containing one 
blank port.  The grammar is ambiguous.</p> 
 
<p>To explore how Cadence handles this case, consider the file blank.v, which 
explores this question and some related matters.  The short of it (in 
particular see inst1a) is that Cadence seems to treat this as an empty list, 
with no ports.  And a funny consequence of this is that one cannot instantiate 
a one-port module with a blank, unless named argument lists are used.</p> 
 
<p>Cadence's handling seems like the most sensible choice, and we are going to 
mimick it.  Because this is somewhat delicate, we also include a number of unit 
tests at the bottom of this file.</p>
