<p>Proof that variable renaming preserves the static safety checks.</p><p>As mentioned in <a href="YUL____RENAMING-VARIABLES.html">renaming-variables</a>, 
     the renaming list/alist consists of 
     the variables in scope for the old code (the keys of the alist) and 
     the variables in scope for the new code (the values of the alist). 
     Thus, we prove theorems saying that 
     if two pieces of code are related by variable renaming, 
     and the old code is safe with respect to 
     the variables that are the keys of the renaming alist, 
     then the new code is safe with respect to 
     the variables that are the values of the renaming alist; 
     furthermore, if the renaming list is updated, 
     the updated variables in scope are still the keys and values, 
     for the old and new code; 
     furthermore, if the static safety checks 
     return information other than updated variables in scope 
     (e.g. modes, or numbers of values), 
     that information is the same for old and new code.</p><p>The above is just a sketch. 
     Things are explained in more detail below.</p>
