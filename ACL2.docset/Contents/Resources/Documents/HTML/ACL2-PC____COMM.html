<p>(macro) 
display instructions from the current interactive session</p><pre class="code">Examples:
comm
(comm 10)

General Form:
(comm &amp;optional n)</pre> 
 
 <p>Prints out instructions in reverse order.  This is actually the same as 
 <span class="v">(commands n t)</span> â€” or, <span class="v">(commands nil t)</span> if <span class="v">n</span> is not 
 supplied.  As for <span class="v">commands</span> (see <a href="ACL2-PC____COMMANDS.html">ACL2-pc::commands</a>), the final 
 argument of <span class="v">t</span> causes suppression of instructions occurring between 
 so-called ``matching bookends,'' which we now explain.</p> 
 
 <p>A ``begin bookend'' is an instruction of the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">COMMENT</a> :BEGIN x . y).</pre> 
 
 <p>Similarly, an ``end bookend'' is an instruction of the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">COMMENT</a> :END x' . y').</pre> 
 
 <p>The ``name'' of the first bookend is <span class="v">x</span> and the ``name'' of the second 
 bookend is <span class="v">x'</span>.  When such a pair of instructions occurs in the current 
 state-stack, we call them ``matching bookends'' provided that they have the 
 same name (i.e. <span class="v">x</span> equals <span class="v">x'</span>) and if no other begin or end bookend 
 with name <span class="v">x</span> occurs between them.  The idea now is that <span class="v">comm</span> hides 
 matching bookends together with the instructions they enclose.  Here is a more 
 precise explanation of this ``hiding''; probably there is no value in reading 
 on!</p> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">comm</span> instruction hides bookends in the following manner.  (So does a 
 <span class="v">comment</span> instruction when its second optional argument is supplied and 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span>.)  First, if the first argument <span class="v">n</span> is supplied and not 
 <span class="v">nil</span>, then we consider only the last <span class="v">n</span> instructions from the 
 state-stack; otherwise, we consider them all.  Now the resulting list of 
 instructions is replaced by the result of applying the following process to 
 each pair of matching bookends: the pair is removed, together with everything 
 in between the begin and end bookend of the pair, and all this is replaced by 
 the ``instruction''</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">("***HIDING***" :COMMENT :BEGIN name ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> begin name ...)</span> is the begin bookend of the pair. 
 Finally, after applying this process to each pair of matching bookends, each 
 begin bookend of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> begin name ...)</span>  that remains is 
 replaced by</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">("***UNFINISHED***" :COMMENT :BEGIN name ...) .</pre>
