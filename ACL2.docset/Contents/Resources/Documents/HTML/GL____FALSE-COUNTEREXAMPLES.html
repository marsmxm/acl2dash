<p></p> 
 
<p>Occasionally, GL will abort a proof after printing:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">False counterexample!  See :xdoc gl::false-counterexamples.</pre> 
 
<p>Most of the time, you might think of GL as an "exact" system where we have 
an explicit Boolean function representation of every bit in all the objects in 
your conjecture.  Ideally, this should allow GL to either prove your theorem or 
find a counterexample.</p> 
 
<p>This isn't always the case. Sometimes GL represents objects more abstractly. 
For example, GL tends not to support operations on non-integer rational 
numbers.  If it runs into a call of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 1/3 x)</span>, it may represent the result 
abstractly, as a term-like symbolic object:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(:g-apply binary-*  1/3  (:g-integer ...))</pre> 
 
<p>(assuming <span class="v">x</span> is represented as a <span class="v">:g-integer) object).  This sort of
abstraction can help to avoid creating potentially very-expensive symbolic
objects, and is an important part of GL's @(see term-level-reasoning).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of abstraction can be contagious.  For example, if we are trying
to prove @('(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 1/3 x) 'not-a-number))</span>, then using the 
<span class="v">:g-apply</span> representation for the <span class="v">*</span> subterm will likely cause GL to 
also use a <span class="v">:g-apply</span> representation for the whole term.  But now, how is GL 
supposed to give this to a SAT solver?</p> 
 
<p>When GL finds a <span class="v">:g-apply</span> object in a Boolean context, such as an IF 
test or a theorem's hypothesis or conclusion, it will create a fresh Boolean 
variable to represent that term.  But if, say, that term is something like</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(:g-apply equal (:g-apply binary-* 1/3 ...)
                not-a-number)</pre> 
 
<p>which is always false, then this Boolean variable is too general, and by 
replacing the term with the Boolean variable, GL has lost track of the fact 
that the term is actually always false.  This generally leads to false 
counterexamples.</p> 
 
<h3>Dealing with False Counterexamples</h3> 
 
 
<p>The first things to check for when you encounter a false counterexample:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Missing <span class="v">:g-bindings</span>: When a variable is omitted from the 
<span class="v">:g-bindings</span> form, a warning is printed and the missing variable is 
assigned a <span class="v">:g-var</span> object.  A <span class="v">:g-var</span> can represent any ACL2 object, 
without restriction.  Symbolic counterparts typically produce <span class="v">:g-apply</span> 
objects when called on <span class="v">:g-var</span> arguments, and this can easily lead to false 
counterexamples.</li> 
 
<li>The stack depth limit, or "clock", was exhausted.  This may happen when 
symbolically executing a recursive function if the termination condition can't 
be detected, though this is often caused by previous introduction of an 
unexpected G-APPLY object.</li> 
 
<li>An unsupported primitive was called.  For example, as of August 2013 we do 
not yet support UNARY-/, so any call of UNARY-/ encountered during symbolic 
execution will return a G-APPLY of UNARY-/ to the input argument.  It may be 
that you can avoid calling such functions by installing an <a href="GL____ALTERNATE-DEFINITIONS.html">alternate definition</a>.</li> 
 
<li>A primitive was called on an unsupported type of symbolic object.  For 
example, the symbolic counterparts for most arithmetic primitives will produce 
a G-APPLY object if an input seems like it might represent a non-integer 
rational.  Since symbolic operations on rationals are absurdly expensive, we 
simply don't implement them for the most part.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>It is common to use GL in such a way that G-VAR forms are not used, and 
G-APPLY forms are unwelcome if they appear at all; when they do, they typically 
result in a symbolic execution failure of some sort.  However, there are ways 
of using GL in which G-VAR and G-APPLY forms are expected to exist; see <a href="GL____TERM-LEVEL-REASONING.html">term-level-reasoning</a>.  If you are not expecting GL to create G-APPLY objects 
but you are encountering false counterexamples, we suggest using the following 
form to determine why a G-APPLY object is first being created:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(gl::break-on-g-apply)</pre> 
 
<p>Then when GL::G-APPLY is called in order to create the form, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BREAK_42.html">BREAK$</a>)</span> 
will be called.  Usually this will allow you to look at the backtrace and 
determine in what context the first G-APPLY object is being created.</p> 
 
<p>Alternatively, if you are expecting some G-APPLY forms to be created but 
unexpected ones are cropping up, you can make the break conditional 
on the function symbol being applied:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(gl::break-on-g-apply :allowed-fns (foo bar))</pre>
