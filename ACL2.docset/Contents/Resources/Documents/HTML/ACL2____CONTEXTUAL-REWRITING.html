<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____CONTEXTUAL-REWRITING">Click for Contextual-rewriting in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A meta-rule system that lets the ACL2 rewriter pass around contextual 
information.  Similar to Dave Greve's NARY.  This extends ACL2's notion of 
congruence-based rewriting.</p>The motivating example:  We have the following two theorems: 
<pre class="code">(defthm mod-n-first-arg-of-plus-context 
  (implies (and (rationalp x) 
                (rationalp y) 
                (rationalp n) 
                (not (equal n 0))) 
           (equal (mod (+ (mod x n) y) n) 
                  (mod (+ x y) n)))) 
(defthm mod-n-second-arg-of-plus-context 
  (implies (and (rationalp x) 
                (rationalp y) 
                (rationalp n) 
                (not (equal n 0))) 
           (equal (mod (+ x (mod y n)) n) 
                  (mod (+ x y) n)))) 
</pre> 
Basically, if we have addition in a mod N context, then each of the terms of 
the sum is also in a mod N context.  Now suppose we have: 
<pre class="code">(defthm foo-bar-under-mod 
   (equal (mod (foo m n) n) 
          (mod (bar m n) n))) 
</pre> 
This allows us to rewrite (foo m n) to (bar m n) under a mod N context.  But 
perhaps we want to prove: 
<pre class="code">(implies (and (rationalp a) 
              ... 
              (rationalp n) 
              (not (equal n 0))) 
             (equal (mod (+ a b c d (foo m n) e) n) 
                    (mod (+ a b c d (bar m n) e) n))) 
</pre> 
 
Logically, the three theorems we have are sufficent to prove this last one. 
But it's painful because the rewrite rules don't really help us.  What we 
really want is to be able to say: When rewriting a sum under mod N context, 
we may rewrite all its terms under a mod N context. 
 
So here's how our meta rule accomplishes that.  We take our two context 
theorems and tell our meta rule to use them: 
<pre class="code">(add-context-rule mod (:rewrite mod-n-first-arg-of-plus-context)) 
(add-context-rule mod (:rewrite mod-n-second-arg-of-plus-context)) 
</pre> 
A special thing about each of these rules is that the LHS unifies with the RHS, 
and there is only one variable in the substitution that isn't bound to itself 
after this unification.  Namely, in the first rule, <span class="tt">x</span> is bound to 
<span class="tt">(mod x n)</span>, but <span class="tt">y</span> and <span class="tt">n</span> are bound to themselves. 
This is the requirement for a context rule.  It is used as follows. 
 
Suppose we've come to the MOD term on the LHS of the theorem above.  Our meta rule 
operates by trying to apply rewrite rules backwards!  So first, we unify our 
term, <span class="tt">(mod (+ a b c d (foo m n) e) n)</span>, with the RHS of the first rule, 
<span class="tt">(mod (+ x y) n)</span>.  This works and we have <span class="tt">x</span> bound to 
<span class="tt">a</span>, <span class="tt">y</span> bound to <span class="tt">(+ b c d (foo m n) e)</span>, and <span class="tt">n</span> 
bound to <span class="tt">n</span>.  We then simplify the term corresponding to <span class="tt">x</span> in 
the LHS under this substitution.  This is just <span class="tt">(mod a n)</span>, which 
probably doesn't simplify to anything.  So this application fails. 
 
We then try the second rule.  This causes <span class="tt">y</span>, which is bound to 
<span class="tt">(+ b c d (foo m n) e)</span>, to be rewritten under mod N.  Now, our meta 
rule fires recursively on this sum, so each element is rewritten under a mod N 
context.  Specifically, when we get to <span class="tt">(foo m n)</span>, we can apply 
foo-bar-under-mod. 
 
To do: performance tuning; get it working under equivalences other than equal; 
add mechanism for disabling certain context-propagation rules; add ttree stuff 
when it becomes available.
