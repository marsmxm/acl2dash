<p>ATC tutorial.</p><h5>Scope of the Tutorial</h5><p>This tutorial is work in progress, 
    but it may be already useful in its current incomplete form. 
    This tutorial's goal is to provide user-level pedagogical information 
    on how ATC works and how to use ATC effectively. 
    See <a href="C____ATC.html">the ATC manual page</a> for the ATC reference documentation.</p><p>In this tutorial, 
    we refer to the official C standard in the manner explained in <a href="C____C.html">the top-level XDOC topic of our C library</a>.</p><h5>Structure of the Tutorial</h5><p>This tutorial consists of this top-level page 
    plus a number of hyperlinked pages, 
    all of which are subtopics of this top-level page, 
    listed below alphabetically for easy reference. 
    Starting from this top-level page, 
    we provide <i>Start</i> and <i>Next</i> links 
    to navigate sequentially through all the tutorial pages; 
    we also provide <i>Previous</i> links going the opposite direction. 
    It is recommended to follow this order 
    when reading this tutorial for the first time.</p><p>Some pages may be skipped at first reading, 
    because they contain additional information 
    that may not be necessary for a user to know in order to start using ATC; 
    such pages include explicit text indicating that. 
    However, it is recommended to read all the pages, eventually.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Start:</b> <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-MOTIVATION.html">Motivation for Generating C Code from ACL2</a></p>
