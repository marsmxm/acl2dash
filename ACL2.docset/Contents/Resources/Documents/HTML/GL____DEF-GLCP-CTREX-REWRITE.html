<p>Define a heuristic for GL to use when generating counterexamples</p><p>Usage:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="GL____DEF-GLCP-CTREX-REWRITE.html">gl::def-glcp-ctrex-rewrite</a>
  ;; from:
  (lhs-lvalue lhs-rvalue)
  ;; to:
  (rhs-lvalue rhs-rvalue)
  :test syntaxp-term)</pre> 
<p>Example:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="GL____DEF-GLCP-CTREX-REWRITE.html">gl::def-glcp-ctrex-rewrite</a>
  ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> n x) t)
  (x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGIOR.html">logior</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ASH.html">ash</a> 1 n) x))
  :test (<a href="ACL2____QUOTEP.html">quotep</a> n))</pre> 
 
<p>If GL has generated Boolean variables corresponding to term-level objects, 
then an assignment to the Boolean variables does not directly induce an 
assignment of ACL2 objects to the ACL2 variables.  Instead, we have terms that 
are assigned true or false by the Boolean assignment, and to generate a 
counterexample, we must find an assignment for the variables in those terms 
that cause the terms to take the required truth values.  Ctrex-rewrite rules 
tell GL how to move from a valuation of a term to valuations of its 
components.</p> 
 
<p>The example rule above says that if we want <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> n x)</span> to be <span class="v">t</span>, 
and <span class="v">n</span> is (syntactically) a quoted constant, then assign <span class="v">x</span> a new value 
by effectively setting its <span class="v">n</span>th bit to T (that is, bitwise ORing X with the 
appropriate mask).</p> 
 
<p>Note that this rule does not always yield the desired result -- for example, 
in the case where N is a negative integer.  Because these are just heuristics 
for generating counterexamples, there is no correctness requirement and no 
checking of these rules.  Bad counterexample rules can't make anything unsound, 
but they can cause generated counterexamples to be nonsense.  Be careful!</p>
