<p>Special detection of name clashes involving generate block names.</p><p>Here we are trying to defend against NOT OK things such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire foo;
if (version == 1)
begin : foo
  ...
end</pre> 
 
<p>Note that the above is NOT OK even if <span class="v">version != 1</span>, i.e., even if the 
block is not going to exist after elaboration.  See failtest/gen1*.v for many 
informative and related tests.</p> 
 
<p>For everything else, our nameclash handling basically works as follows.  For 
any arbitrary scope, check for name clashes by:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>collecting up its scopeitem-alist, then</li> 
<li>checking it for duplicate keys.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>This works for almost everything (wire names, module instance names, port 
names, etc.), but our scopeitem-alist building code only collects the names 
from top-level named genblocks and genarrays.  This makes perfect sense in 
post-elaboration contexts where any conditional generates have been eliminated, 
but it isn't right for us here because it doesn't get things like <span class="v">foo</span> 
above.  That is, it doesn't get any named blocks that occur as loop bodies, or 
under if/case constructs.</p> 
 
<p>That's actually good.  It's needs to be OK to have things like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">if (version == 1)
begin : foo
  ...
end
else if (version == 2)
begin : foo              &lt;--- no name clash with foo from above
  ...
end</pre> 
 
<p>So if scopeitem-alist collection was ``smarter'' and somehow dived down into 
the if/else blocks, we might think that there was a name clash for <span class="v">foo</span>, 
which there isn't.</p> 
 
<p>Anyway, our goal here is basically to augment the scopeitem-alist that we 
would normally produce with a supplemental scopeitem alist that accounts for 
the named blocks within any if/case/loop generate constructs.</p>
