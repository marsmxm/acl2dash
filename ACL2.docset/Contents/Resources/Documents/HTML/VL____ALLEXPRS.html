<p>Functions for gathering all the expressions used throughout some 
module item.</p><p>These functions gather up what we regard as the "top level" 
expressions used throughout various module items.  That is, consider an 
assignment statement such as <span class="v">foo = a + b</span>; the associated list of allexprs 
would include two expressions: one for <span class="v">foo</span>, and one for <span class="v">a + b</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Note that despite the name "allexprs", we actually do not gather 
expressions within <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> foo = bar *)</span>-style attributes.</p>
