<p>Post-translation step: 
          simplify conditional expressions.</p><p>The translation step may produce Java conditional expressions 
     <span class="v">... ? ... : ...</span> whose condition is a Java boolean literal, 
     i.e. either <span class="v">true</span> or <span class="v">false</span>. 
     In either case, the expression may be always replaced with 
     the appropriate branch, making the code more readable and efficient.</p><p>This kind of Java conditional expressions arise, in particular, 
     when the quoted constants <span class="v">t</span> and <span class="v">nil</span> in ACL2, 
     which are translated to the Java's literals <span class="v">true</span> and <span class="v">false</span>, 
     are used as symbols (not as booleans), 
     thus generating Java code to convert them to 
     <span class="v">Acl2Symbol.T</span> and <span class="v">Acl2Symbol.NIL</span>.</p><p>This post-translation step carries out this simplification.</p>
