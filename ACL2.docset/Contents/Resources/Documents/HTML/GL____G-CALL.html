<p>A shape-spec representing a function call.</p><p>Note: This is an advanced topic.  You should first read <a href="GL____TERM-LEVEL-REASONING.html">term-level-reasoning</a> to see whether this is of interest, then be familiar with 
<a href="GL____SHAPE-SPECS.html">shape-specs</a> before reading this.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">G-CALL</span> is the constructor for a shape-spec representing a function 
call.  Usage:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="GL____G-CALL.html">g-call</a> &lt;function name&gt;
        &lt;list of argument shape-specs&gt;
        &lt;inverse function&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>This yields a G-APPLY object (see <a href="GL____SYMBOLIC-OBJECTS.html">symbolic-objects</a>):</p> 
<pre class="code">(g-apply &lt;function name&gt;
         &lt;list of argument symbolic objects&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>The inverse function field does not affect the symbolic object that is 
generated from the g-call object, but it determines how we attempt to prove the 
coverage obligation.</p> 
 
<p>The basic coverage obligation for assigning some variable V a shape spec SS 
is that for every possible value of V satisfying the hypotheses, there must be 
an environment under which the symbolic object derived from SS evaluates to 
that value.  The coverage proof must show that there exists such an 
environment.</p> 
 
<p>Providing an inverse function INV basically says:</p> 
 
<p><div class="box"> 
   "If we need (FN ARGS) to evaluate to VAL, then ARGS should be (INV VAL)." 
</div></p> 
 
<p>So to prove that (G-CALL FN ARGS INV) covers VAL, we first prove that ARGS 
cover (INV VAL), then that (FN (INV VAL)) equals VAL.  The argument that this 
works is:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We first prove ARGS covers (INV VAL) -- that is, there exists some 
environment E under which the symbolic objects derived from ARGS evaluate 
to (INV VAL).</li> 
 
<li>Since (FN (INV VAL)) equals VAL, this same environment E suffices to make 
the symbolic object (FN ARGS) evaluate to VAL.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>We'll now show an example. We build on the memory example discussed in <a href="GL____TERM-LEVEL-REASONING.html">term-level-reasoning</a>.  Suppose we want to initially assign a memory object 
<span class="v">mem</span> a symbolic value under which address 1 has been assigned a 10-bit 
integer.  That is, we want to be able to assume only the following about 
<span class="v">mem</span>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">signed-byte-p</a> 10 (access-mem 1 mem))</pre> 
 
<p>Assuming our memory follows the standard record rules, i.e.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(update-mem addr (access-mem addr mem) mem) = mem,</pre> 
 
<p>we can represent any such memory as</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(update-mem 1 &lt;some 10-bit integer&gt; &lt;some memory&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>Our shape-spec for this will therefore be:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="GL____G-CALL.html">g-call</a> 'update-mem
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 1
              (g-integer (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)) ;; 10-bit integer
              (g-var 'mem)) ;; free variable
        &lt;some inverse function&gt;)</pre> 
 
<p>What is an appropriate inverse?  The inverse needs to take any memory 
satisfying our assumption and generate the list of necessary arguments to 
update-mem that fit this template.  The following works:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (m) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 1 (access-mem 1 m) m))</pre> 
 
<p>because for any value m satisfying our assumptions,</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>the first argument returned is 1, which is covered by our shape-spec 1</li> 
 
<li>the second argument returned will (by the assumption) be a 10-bit integer, 
which is covered by our g-number shape-spec</li> 
 
<li>the third argument returned matches our g-var shape-spec since anything at 
all is covered by it</li> 
 
<li>the final term we end up with is: 
<pre class="code">(update-mem 1 (access-mem 1 m) m)</pre> 
    which (by the record rule above) equals m.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>GL tries to manage coverage proofs itself, and when using G-CALL constructs 
some rules besides the ones it typically uses may be necessary -- for example, 
the redundant record update rule used here.  You may add these rules to the 
rulesets used for coverage proofs as follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ADD-TO-RULESET.html">acl2::add-to-ruleset</a> gl::shape-spec-obj-in-range-backchain
                      redundant-mem-update)
(<a href="ACL2____ADD-TO-RULESET.html">acl2::add-to-ruleset</a> gl::shape-spec-obj-in-range-open
                      redundant-mem-update)</pre> 
 
<p>There are two rulesets because these are used in slightly different phases of 
the coverage proof.</p> 
 
<p>This feature has not yet been widely used and the detailed mechanisms 
for (e.g.)  adding rules to the coverage strategy are likely to change.</p>
