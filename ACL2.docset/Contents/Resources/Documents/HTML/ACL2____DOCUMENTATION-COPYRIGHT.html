<p>Copyright and authorship of documentation</p><p>There are two manuals associated with ACL2: the ACL2 User's Manual 
 and the ACL2+Books Manual.  See <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>.  The former is 
 distributed with ACL2, you can reach many links into it from the ACL2 home 
 page.  The latter may be preferred for routine browsing, since it extends the 
 ACL2 User's Manual with documentation obtained from the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 User's Manual is copyrighted under the terms of the <span class="v">LICENSE</span> 
 file distributed with ACL2.  Its original authors are the ACL2 authors, but it 
 is now defined in an ACL2 community book, <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>, 
 so that members of the ACL2 community may contribute to it.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2+Books Manual is a mechanically generated mashup derived from both 
 the ACL2 User's Manual and the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>.  The ACL2+Books Manual 
 thus has contributions from many authors.  At the top of each topic, in a line 
 under the topic name, you will generally find either ``ACL2 Sources'' or the 
 name of a Community Book.  In the former case, the text is from the ACL2 
 User's Manual and is authored, copyrighted, and licensed as per the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COPYRIGHT.html">copyright</a>.  When a book is named, the content was extracted from that book 
 which may be inspected for authorship, copyright, and license terms.</p> 
 
 <p>There are two standard tools for browsing these manuals, other than using 
 the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> command at the terminal.</p>
