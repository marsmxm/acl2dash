<p>Start displaying proof trees during proofs</p><p>Also see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> and see <a href="ACL2____STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a>.  Note 
 that <span class="v">:start-proof-tree</span> works by removing <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a></span> from 
 the <span class="v">inhibit-output-lst</span>; see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Explanations of proof tree displays may be found elsewhere: see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>.  In a nutshell: <span class="v">:start-proof-tree</span> causes proof tree display 
 to be turned on, once it has been turned off by <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Do not attempt to invoke <span class="v">start-proof-tree</span> during an interrupt in the 
 middle of a proof.</p>
