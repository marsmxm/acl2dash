<p>Introduce an <a href="CRYPTO____INTERFACES.html">interface</a> for a cryptographic encryption function 
           with an initialization vector.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Block encryption functions 
     (whose interfaces may be generated via <span class="tt"><a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-ENCRYPT-BLOCK.html">definterface-encrypt-block</a></span>) 
     may be used to encrypt data larger than single blocks 
     by combining multiple block encryptions 
     according to various schemes (e.g. CBC). 
     Some of these schemes require an initialization vector as additional input. 
     This also applies to the inverse decryption functions.</p><p>This macro introduces weakly constrained ACL2 functions 
     for two pairs of cryptographic encryption and decryption functions 
     that use an initialization vector: 
     one that operates on bits and one that operates on bytes. 
     Each of these four functions takes as inputs 
     a key, an initialization vector, and some arbitrary data, 
     and has a guard requiring all three to be bit or byte lists 
     and the first two to have the right key and block sizes. 
     These functions are constrained to return sequences of bits or bytes, 
     and also to fix their inputs to bit or byte lists. 
     We may extend this macro to generate additional constraints, 
     such as the fact that encryption and decryption are mutual inverses, 
     or that the size of the ouput data 
     is suitably related to the input data. 
     These functions are meant to also pad the input data to the block size; 
     then the size of the output data consist of as many blocks as 
     the padded input blocks.</p><p>This macro also introduces a few theorems 
     that follow from the constraints. 
     It also introduces an XDOC topic for the generated 
     functions, constraints, and theorems.</p><h3>General Form</h3><pre class="code">(<a href="CRYPTO____DEFINTERFACE-ENCRYPT-INIT.html">definterface-encrypt-init</a> name
