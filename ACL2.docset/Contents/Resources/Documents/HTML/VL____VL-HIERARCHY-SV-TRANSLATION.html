<p>Discussion of the strategy for translating VL modules (and structs, 
interfaces, etc.) to SV modules.</p><p>This topic covers the general idea of how we translate a simplified 
VL design into an SV module alist.  The top-level function for this is <a href="VL____VL-DESIGN-_E3SVEX-MODALIST.html">vl-design-&gt;svex-modalist</a>, not to be confused with <a href="VL____VL-DESIGN-_E3SV-DESIGN.html">vl-design-&gt;sv-design</a> which additionally runs the series of transforms 
necessary to simplify a design once loaded.</p> 
 
<p>The input to this translation is a VL design which has had module parameters 
and generate blocks resolved, expressions sized, and always blocks eliminated, 
among other requirements.  (<a href="VL____VL-DESIGN-_E3SV-DESIGN.html">Vl-design-&gt;sv-design</a> performs the 
necessary transforms before calling <a href="VL____VL-DESIGN-_E3SVEX-MODALIST.html">vl-design-&gt;svex-modalist</a>.)</p> 
 
<p>The crux of this translation is the translation of VL expressions to svex 
expressions, which is discussed in <a href="VL____VL-EXPR-SVEX-TRANSLATION.html">vl-expr-svex-translation</a>.  Here we'll 
discuss how these expressions are built into an SVEX module hierarchy to 
mirror (and sometimes expand on) the VL hierarchy, in such a way that these 
modules can then be flattened and compiled into an SVEX-based FSM (see <a href="SV____SVEX-COMPILATION.html">sv::svex-compilation</a>).</p> 
 
<h3>Hierarchy and Data Types</h3> 
 
<p>The final goal of the SVEX translation and compilation process is to obtain 
a FSM-style flat table of expressions that gives formulas for wire values and 
next-states of stateholding elements.  To do this, one of the major challenges 
is flattening a module hierarchy so that all the possible ways of referring to 
a given wire collapse into one canonical one.  For example, take the following 
module hierarchy:</p> 
<pre class="code">module c (input [3:0] ci, output [5:3] co);
endmodule

module b (input [5:2] bi, output [4:0] bo);
   c cinst (.ci(bi[5:4]+4'b10</pre>, .co(bo[4:2])); 
  endmodule 
 
  module a (); 
    wire [3:11] w; 
    b binst (.bi(w[3:6]), .bo({w[9:11], w[7:8]})); 
  endmodule 
 }) 
 
<p>Here, the following expressions all refer to the same 3-bit chunk:</p> 
<pre class="code">w[9:11]
binst.bo[4:2]
binst.cinst.co[5:3]</pre> 
 
<p>To make sense of these modules, if we have expressions within module <span class="v">c</span> 
that refer to <span class="v">co</span>, we need to be able to reduce these, once the module 
hierarchy is flattened, to refer instead to <span class="v">w</span> -- or vice versa; it's not 
so important which direction as long as there's a canonical form.</p> 
 
<p>The svex compilation process (see <a href="SV____SVEX-COMPILATION.html">sv::svex-compilation</a>) deals with 
this by collecting a table of aliases among wires, and then using a 
union-find-like algorithm to find a canonical form for each wire (see <a href="SV____ALIAS-NORMALIZATION.html">sv::alias-normalization</a>).  The input for this algorithm that we want to 
collect for the above module hierarchy is the following list of alias 
pairings:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">w[3:6]               &lt;--&gt;    binst.bi[5:2]
{w[9:11], w[7:8]}    &lt;--&gt;    binst.bo[4:0]
binst.bo[4:2]        &lt;--&gt;    binst.cinst.co[5:3]</pre> 
 
<p>(Note: We have one alias pair for each port connection except for the <span class="v">ci</span> 
input of <span class="v">cinst</span> in b.  Because the expression connected to this port is not 
simply a concatenation of other wires, we want an assignment instead.)</p> 
 
<p>These names are shown relative to the top-level module, but initially, in 
<a href="VL____VL-DESIGN-_E3SVEX-MODALIST.html">vl-design-&gt;svex-modalist</a>, aliases are associated with the module in 
which they were generated and the names in those aliases are relative to that 
module.  So we generate a module hierarchy something like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code"> module c ();
  wire [3:0] ci;
  wire [5:3] co;
 endmodule

 module b ();
  wire [5:2] bi;
  wire [4:0] bo;
  c cinst ();
  assign cinst.ci[3:0] = bi[5:4]+4'b10;
  alias bo[4:2] = cinst.co[5:3];
endmodule

module a ();
  wire [3:11] w;
  b binst ();
  alias w[3:6] = binst.bi[5:2];
  alias {w[9:11], w[7:8]} = binst.bo[4:0];
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>With this approach, relative-scoped hierarchical identifiers are dealt with 
automatically by alias normalization.  This approach to aliasing lends itself 
rather naturally to dealing with complex datatypes and interfaces.  We turn 
structs, unions, arrays, and interfaces into "modules" that each have some 
internal aliases to set up the relationships among the local wires.  For 
example, suppose we have the following module with a struct-typed variable:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">typedef struct { logic [3:0] a; logic [2:4] b; } mystruct;

module a ();
 mystruct m;
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>This gets turned into a module hierarchy as follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module struct##mystruct ();
   logic [6:0] __self;   // represents the whole struct
   logic [3:0] a;
   logic [2:4] b;

   alias __self[6:3] = a[3:0];
   alias __self[2:0] = b[2:4];
endmodule

module a ();
 // m becomes both a wire and also a module instance:
 logic [6:0] m;
 struct##mystruct m ();

 alias m = m.__self;

endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>It wouldn't be possible in Verilog to have <span class="v">m</span> be the name of both a 
variable and a module instance, but this is allowed in svex modules.  This 
allows us to view struct indexing as just another form of relative hierarchical 
reference.  Arrays become another kind of module, where the wires inside are 
the array's indices.  Nested data structures become data-structure modules that 
instantiate other data-structure modules.  Interfaces are treated as a 
combination of struct variable and module instance.</p> 
 
<p>This approach to array indexing also lets us deal straightforwardly with 
instance arrays; see <a href="VL____VL-INSTARRAY-NESTED-ALIASES.html">vl-instarray-nested-aliases</a> for details.</p> 
 
<h3>Scopes</h3> 
 
<p>Given a module hierarchy like the examples from the previous section, it is 
straightforward to flatten the hierarchy into a list of assignments and 
aliases.  Then the alias normalization algorithm is able to compute canonical 
forms for all aliased wires, and the names used in the assignments can be 
normalized.</p> 
 
<p>One complication of this picture is that modules may contain nested scopes, 
in which variable names may shadow those in higher scopes.  For example, 
generate blocks produce scopes within modules:</p> 
<pre class="code">module a ();
  wire wa;
  wire wb = 1;
  if (1) begin : myblock
     wire wb = 0;  // shadows module-global binding
     assign wa = wb;
  end

  wire wc = myblock.wb;

  // test:
  initial begin
    #10;
    $display("wa: %b", wa);
    $display("wb: %b", wb);
    $display("wc: %b", wc);
  end

endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>This shows the 0,1,0 as the values of <span class="v">wa, wb, wc</span> respectively.  In 
order to support this, we want to first turn the <span class="v">myblock</span> scope into a 
module instance inside module <span class="v">a</span> so that the reference to <span class="v">myblock.wb</span> 
will work.  But we also need to resolve the reference to <span class="v">wa</span> inside 
<span class="v">myblock</span> to the wire <span class="v">wa</span> in its containing module.  To handle this, we 
use a variable naming convention that distinguishes between hierarchical names 
relative to the current scope, and those relevant to some higher scope.  We'll 
write this for now in pseudo-Verilog as <span class="v">$upscope(n, a.b.c)</span>, where 
<span class="v">a.b.c</span> is a path that is relative to the module <span class="v">n</span> scopes above the 
current one.  We translate module <span class="v">a</span> as follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module genblock##a.myblock ();
  wire wb;
  assign wb = 0;
  assign $upscope(1, wa) = wb;
endmodule

module a ();
  wire wa;
  wire wb;
  wire wc;

  genblock##a.myblock myblock ();

  assign wb = 1;
  assign wc = myblock.wb;
endmodule</pre>
