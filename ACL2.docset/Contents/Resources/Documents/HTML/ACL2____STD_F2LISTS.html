<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____STD_F2LISTS">Click for Std/lists in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A library for reasoning about basic list operations like <a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a>, <a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a>, <a href="ACL2____TAKE.html">take</a>, etc.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">std/lists</span> library provides lemmas that are useful when reasoning 
about the basic list functions that are built into ACL2, and also defines some 
additional functions like <a href="ACL2____LIST-FIX.html">list-fix</a>, <a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a>, <a href="ACL2____SET-EQUIV.html">set-equiv</a>, and so 
on.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">std/lists</span> library is based largely on books that were previously 
part of the <span class="v">unicode</span> library, but also incorporates ideas from earlier 
books such as <span class="v">data-structures/list-defthms</span> and 
<span class="v">data-structures/number-list-defthms</span> and also from <span class="v">coi/lists</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Loading the Library</h3> 
 
<p>The recommended way to load the library, especially for beginning to 
intermediate ACL2 users, is to simply include the <span class="v">top</span> book, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/lists/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>This book loads quickly (typically in under a second), gives you everything 
we have to offer, and sets up a "recommended" theory.  See below for some 
general comments about this theory.</p> 
 
<p>For advanced users, we recommend using the <span class="v">top</span> book if possible. 
However, in case you find this book to be too heavy or too incompatible with 
your existing developments, the library is mostly arranged in a "buffet" 
style that is meant to allow you to load as little or as much as you like.  A 
particularly useful book is</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/lists/list-defuns" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>which adds the new <span class="v">std/lists</span> functions like <a href="ACL2____LIST-FIX.html">list-fix</a>, but 
has (almost) no theorems.  Typically, you would then want to (perhaps locally) 
include individual books for the particular list functions you are dealing 
with.  The books have sensible names, e.g., you might write:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/lists/list-defuns" :dir :system)
(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/lists/append" :dir :system))
(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/lists/rev" :dir :system))
(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/lists/repeat" :dir :system))</pre> 
 
<p>The best way to see what books are available is to just run <span class="v">ls</span> in the 
<span class="v">std/lists</span> directory.  Unlike the top book, most individual books are meant 
to be reasonably unobtrusive, e.g., loading the <span class="v">append</span> book will not 
disable <a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Things to Note</h3> 
 
<p>When you include the <span class="v">top</span> book, note that many basic, built-in ACL2 list 
functions like <span class="v">append</span> and <span class="v">len</span> will be <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.  As a result, 
ACL2 will sometimes not automatically try to induct as it did before.  You may 
find that you need to give explicit <span class="v">:induct</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>, or explicitly 
re-<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> these basic functions during certain theorems.  (On the flip 
side, you may also find that you are spending less time trying to prove 
theorems using incorrect induction schemes.)</p> 
 
<p>The library introduces a couple of useful <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relations, 
namely:</p> 
 
<dl> 
<dt><a href="ACL2____LIST-EQUIV.html">list-equiv</a></dt> 
<dd>Equivalences of lists based on <a href="ACL2____LIST-FIX.html">list-fix</a>.</dd> 
<dd>Respected in some way by most list-processing functions.</dd> 
</dl> 
 
<dl> 
<dt><a href="ACL2____SET-EQUIV.html">set-equiv</a></dt> 
<dd>Equivalence of lists up to <a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a>ship, but ignoring order and <a href="ACL2____DUPLICITY.html">duplicity</a>.</dd> 
<dd>
<span class="v">list-equiv</span> is a <a href="ACL2____REFINEMENT.html">refinement</a> of <span class="v">set-equiv</span>.</dd> 
<dd>Respected in a strong way by most "lists as sets" functions, e.g., <a href="COMMON-LISP____SUBSETP.html">subsetp</a>, <a href="ACL2____UNION_42.html">union$</a>, etc.</dd> 
<dd>Preserved by many other ordinary list functions like <a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a>, <a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a>, etc.</dd> 
</dl> 
 
<p>These rules allow for some very powerful equivalence-based reasoning.  When 
introducing new list-processing functions, it is generally a good idea to 
define the appropriate <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> rules for these relations.</p>
