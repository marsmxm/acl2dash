<p>Introduction to ACL2's notion of rewrite rules</p><p>This topic is an introduction to rewrite rules in ACL2 and is 
 intended for the newcomer to ACL2.  The slightly more experienced user might 
 benefit from reading <a href="ACL2____RANDOM-REMARKS-ON-REWRITING.html">random-remarks-on-rewriting</a> instead.</p> 
 
 <p>Rewrite rules make ACL2 replace one term by another.  This is done 
 by the rewriter, which is part of ACL2's simplifier.  The rewriter sweeps 
 through the goal formula trying all the <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a>, and 
 <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> rules it knows, in order from the most recently submitted rule to 
 the oldest, until it finds one to apply.</p> 
 
 <p>Here's an example.  Just pretend that you have made a rewrite rule from the 
 formula below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> i)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> i (<a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a> a)))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (put i v (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> a b))
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (put i v a) b)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then every time the rewriter sees a target term that <i>matches</i></p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(put i v (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> a b))</pre> 
 
 <p>it considers the rule, with the variables <span class="v">i</span>, <span class="v">v</span>, <span class="v">a</span>, and 
 <span class="v">b</span> of the rule <i>bound</i> to whatever terms matched them in the target, 
 say the terms <i>i</i>, <i>v</i>, <i>a</i>, and <i>b</i>.  To consider the 
 rule, the rewriter first tries to establish (``relieve'') the hypotheses.  In 
 particular, it rewrites:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(natp <i>i</i>)           ; <i>hyp 1</i> 
</pre> 
 
 <p>and</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(&lt; <i>i</i> (len <i>a</i>)). ; <i>hyp 2</i> 
</pre> 
 
 <p>If both hypotheses rewrite to true, then the rule <i>fires</i> and replaces 
 the target by:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(append (put <i>i</i> <i>v</i> <i>a</i>) <i>b</i>). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>In short, rewrite rules direct ACL2 to rearrange the terms in the goal 
 formulas.</p> 
 
 <p>We are more precise later, but for now we turn to the question of how do 
 you make a rewrite rule from a formula?  The answer is, you prove the formula 
 with the <span class="v">defthm</span> command.  Recall that</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defthm <i>name</i> 
        <i>formula</i> 
        ...) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>commands ACL2 to try to prove <i>formula</i> and, if successful, build it 
 into the database as a rule according to your specification in the 
 <i>rule-classes</i> argument of the ... part of the command.</p> 
 
 <p>To make it easy for you to generate rewrite rules, <span class="v">defthm</span> has a simple 
 heuristic: if you don't tell it what kind of rule to generate from 
 <i>formula</i>, it generates a rewrite rule!  Thus, if this command</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defthm <i>name</i> 
        <i>formula</i>) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>is successful, ACL2 will have a new rewrite rule in the database, even 
 though you did not <i>explicitly</i> tell it to add a rule.</p> 
 
 <p>A common mistake for new users is to forget that the above command adds a 
 rewrite rule.  This often results in a tangle of rules that lead nowhere or to 
 infinite rewriting that you will have to interrupt.  It is also good to 
 remember that the command <i>only</i> adds a rule.  It does not magically make 
 ACL2 aware of all the mathematical consequences of the formula: it just makes 
 a rewrite rule.</p> 
 
 <p>When you prove a theorem with <span class="v">defthm</span> you are <i>programming</i> ACL2. 
 Being careless in your statement of lemmas is tantamount to being careless in 
 your programming.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 can generate rewrite rules from formulas that look like this:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(IMPLIES (AND <i>hyp1</i> ... <i>hypk</i>) 
         (<i>eqv</i> <i>lhs</i> <i>rhs</i>)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>where <i>eqv</i> is either <span class="v">EQUAL</span> or <span class="v">IFF</span>, and <i>lhs</i> is not a 
 variable symbol, not a constant, and not a call of the function <span class="v">IF</span>, and 
 not a call of an abbreviation (``macro'') that expands to any of these.  So 
 illegal <i>lhs</i> include <span class="v">X</span>, <span class="v">0</span>, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">IF</a> X Y Y)</span>, and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">OR</a> p q)</span>. 
 The last is illegal because <span class="v">OR</span> is just an abbreviation for a certain 
 <span class="v">IF</span>-expression.</p> 
 
 <p>Technical Note: This tutorial introduction to the theorem prover takes 
 liberties with the truth!  We are trying to give you a useful predictive model 
 of the system without burdening you with all the details, which are discussed 
 in the ACL2 User's Manual.  For example, using directives in the rule-classes 
 you can rearrange the proved formula into the form you want your rule to take, 
 and you can make ACL2 take advantage of equivalence relations <i>eqv</i> other 
 than just <span class="v">EQUAL</span> and <span class="v">IFF</span>.  But we'll ignore these fine points for 
 now.</p> 
 
 <p>We call the <i>hyp</i> terms the <i>hypotheses</i> of the rule.  We call 
 <i>lhs</i> the <i>left-hand side</i> of the rule, and we call <i>rhs</i> the 
 <i>right-hand side</i> of the rule.  If the conclusion of the rule is an 
 <span class="v">EQUAL</span> term we call it an <i>equality</i> rule.  Otherwise, it is a 
 <i>propositional equivalence</i> rule.  If there are no hypotheses, 
 <i>k</i>=0, we say the rule is an <i>unconditional</i> rewrite rule; otherwise 
 it is <i>conditional</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 allows several special cases of the shapes above.  See <a href="ACL2____SPECIAL-CASES-FOR-REWRITE-RULES.html">special-cases-for-rewrite-rules</a>, but come back here and continue.</p> 
 
 <p>A rewrite rule makes ACL2 seek out occurrences of terms that match the 
 left-hand side of the rule and replace those occurrences using the right-hand 
 side, provided all the hypotheses rewrite to true in the context of the 
 application of the rule.</p> 
 
 <p>That is, the left-hand side is treated as a <i>pattern</i> that triggers 
 the rule.  The hypotheses are <i>conditions</i> that have to be proved in 
 order for the rule to fire.  The right-hand side is the <i>replacement</i> and 
 is put into the formula where the pattern occurred.</p> 
 
 <p>Now for some clarifications. ACL2 only considers enabled rules.  And ACL2 
 will use a propositional rule to replace a target only if the target occurs in 
 a propositional place in the formula.  Generally that means it occurs in the 
 argument of a propositional connective, like <span class="v">AND</span>, <span class="v">OR</span>, <span class="v">NOT</span>, 
 <span class="v">IMPLIES</span>, and <span class="v">IFF</span>, or in the test of an <span class="v">IF</span>.  When we say that 
 the left-hand side of the rule must <i>match</i> the target we mean that we 
 can instantiate the variables in the rule to make the left-hand side identical 
 to the target.  To <i>relieve</i> or establish the hypotheses of the rule, 
 ACL2 just applies other rewrite rules to try to prove the instantiated 
 hypotheses from the assumptions governing the occurrence of the target.  When 
 ACL2 replaces the target, it replaces it with the instantiated right-hand side 
 of the rule and then applies rewrite rules to that.</p> 
 
 <p>If a hypothesis has variables that do not occur in the left-hand side of 
 the rule, then the pattern matching process won't find values for those 
 variables.  We call those <i>free variables</i>.  They must be instantiated 
 before ACL2 can relieve that hypothesis.  To instantiate them, ACL2 has to 
 guess values that would make the hypothesis true in this context, i.e., true 
 given the assumptions of the goal theorem.  So if you're trying to prove</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">TRUE-LISTP</a> A)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> P) A)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">CDR</a> P) A))
         ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>and the target you're rewriting is in the ``...'' part of the formula, the 
 rewriter knows that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">TRUE-LISTP</a> A)</span> <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> P) A)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">CDR</a> P) A)</span> are true.  So if a rewrite rule is considered and the rule has 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> e x)</span> as a hypothesis, where <span class="v">e</span> is a free variable but <span class="v">x</span> 
 was bound to <span class="v">A</span> in the pattern matching, then it will guess that <span class="v">e</span> 
 must be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> P)</span> or <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">CDR</a> P)</span>, even though there are many other 
 possibilities that would make <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">MEMBER</a> e A)</span> true.  Of course, whatever 
 guess it makes must also satisfy all the other hypotheses that mention <span class="v">e</span> 
 in the rule.  It simply isn't very imaginative at guessing!</p> 
 
 <p>The most predictable rewrite rules have no free variables.  You can add 
 pragmatic advice to help ACL2 with free variables, telling it to try all the 
 possibilities it finds, to try just the first, or even to compute a 
 ``creative'' guess.</p> 
 
 <p>It is possible to make the rewriting process loop forever, e.g., by 
 rewriting <i>alpha</i> to <i>beta</i> with one set of rules and rewriting 
 <i>beta</i> to <i>alpha</i> with another.  Even a single rule can make the 
 process loop; we'll show you an example of that later in the tutorial.  ACL2 
 can handle commutativity rules without looping.  It uses <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a>
 y x))</span> to replace <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> B A)</span> by <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> A B)</span>, but not vice versa.  (It is 
 sensitive to alphabetic ordering when dealing with <i>permutative</i> 
 rules.)</p> 
 
 <p>Logically equivalent formulas can generate radically different rewrite 
 rules!  Rearranging the propositional structure of the formula or swapping the 
 left and right sides of an equality — while having no effect on the 
 mathematical meaning of a formula — can have a drastic impact on the 
 pragmatic meaning as a rule.  To see an illustration of this, see <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENT-FORMULAS-DIFFERENT-REWRITE-RULES.html">equivalent-formulas-different-rewrite-rules</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Developing an effective set of rewrite rules is key to success at using 
 ACL2.  We'll look more at this later in the tutorial.</p>
