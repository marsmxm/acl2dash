<p>(macro) 
save the proof-builder state (state-stack)</p><pre class="code">Example:
(save lemma3-attempt)

General Form:
(save &amp;optional name do-it-flg)</pre> 
 
 <p>Saves the current state of the interactive proof-builder by ``associating'' 
 it with the given name, which must be a symbol.  Submit <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETRIEVE.html">retrieve</a> name)</span> 
 to Lisp to get back to this proof-builder state.  If <span class="v">verify</span> was 
 originally supplied with an event name, then the argument can be omitted in 
 favor of that name as the default.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark</b> that if a <span class="v">save</span> has already been done with the indicated 
 name (or the default event name), then the user will be queried regarding 
 whether to go ahead with the save â€” except, if <span class="v">do-it-flg</span> is 
 supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>, then there will be no query and the <span class="v">save</span> will 
 be effected.</p>
