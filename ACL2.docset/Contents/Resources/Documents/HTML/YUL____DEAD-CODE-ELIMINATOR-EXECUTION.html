<p>Proof that the <span class="v">DeadCodeEliminator</span> transformation preserves 
          the execution behavior.</p><p>We prove that the elimination of dead code performed by the transformation 
     does not affect the dynamic semantics of the code, 
     i.e. the code calculates the same outputs for the same inputs 
     (essentially; more on this below). 
     In the Yul context, inputs must be understood as 
     (parts of) the computation state, 
     and outputs must be understood as 
     expression results as well as (parts of) the computation state.</p><p>We prove correctness theorems 
     for all the execution functions in the dynamic semantics: 
     a theorem for executing expressions, 
     a theorem for executing statements, 
     and so on. 
     This is natural, given that the proof is by mutual induction. 
     These execution functions 
     have slightly different argument and result types, 
     but they all take an initial computation state as argument, 
     and they all return a possibly modified computation state as result, 
     along with values for expressions (see <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____EOUTCOME.html">eoutcome</a></span>) 
     and modes for statements (see <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____SOUTCOME.html">soutcome</a></span>).</p><p>Roughly speaking, we prove theorems of the form</p><pre class="code">(<a href="YUL____EXEC.html">exec</a> (xform ast) cstate) = (<a href="YUL____EXEC.html">exec</a> ast cstate)</pre><p>where <span class="v">exec</span> is one of the execution functions 
     (e.g. <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____EXEC-STATEMENT.html">exec-statement</a></span>), 
     <span class="v">ast</span> is an AST of Yul abstract syntax 
     (e.g. a value of type <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____STATEMENT.html">statement</a></span>), 
     <span class="v">xform</span> is the function that transforms <span class="v">ast</span> 
     (e.g. <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____STATEMENT-DEAD.html">statement-dead</a></span>), 
     and <span class="v">cstate</span> is a computation state. 
     But the actual formal assertion we prove is slightly different, 
     for two reasons explained below.</p><p>The first reason is that the execution functions 
     also take function environments as arguments, 
     which contain function bodies that must be transformed. 
     Thus, we define transformation functions on function environments, 
     and we refine the formulation of our theorems to</p><pre class="code">(<a href="YUL____EXEC.html">exec</a> (xform ast) cstate (xform funenv)) = (<a href="YUL____EXEC.html">exec</a> ast state funenv)</pre><p>The second reason, and refinement of the theorems, 
     has to do with error results, 
     which may be returned by the defensive execution functions. 
     The error values include information about AST pieces 
     and the ACL2 call stack (see <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFRESULT.html">fty::defresult</a></span>), 
     which causes a dependency of error values 
     on more than just the input/output behavior of ACL2 functions, 
     but also on the ASTs executed and the specific calls. 
     Since the <span class="v">DeadCodeEliminator</span> transformation 
     removes certain pieces of ASTs, 
     some functions may return slightly different error values 
     when run on <span class="v">(xform ast)</span> vs. <span class="v">ast</span>. 
     The difference is inessential from a semantic point of view. 
     Thus, we define equivalence relations on execution results, 
     which weaken equality to accommodate slightly different errors. 
     The equivalence holds when two execution results are 
     either not errors and equal, or both errors; 
     that is, we consider all errors equivalent, 
     but we consider non-errors non-equivalent unless equal. 
     The theorem formulation is thus further refined to</p><pre class="code">(<a href="YUL____EXEC.html">exec</a> (xform ast) cstate (xform funenv)) ~=~ (<a href="YUL____EXEC.html">exec</a> ast cstate funenv)</pre><p>where <span class="v">~=~</span> denotes the equivalence 
     (we use this symbol just here, for readability).</p><p>The description above has left out the <span class="v">limit</span> input of <span class="v">exec</span>. 
     For this <span class="v">DeadCodeEliminator</span> transformation, 
     that input is unchanged between the left side and right side, 
     because this transformation does not affect 
     the values taken by the limit during execution: 
     this transformation just removes code 
     that would never be executed anyways.</p><p>The theorems above are simultaneously proved 
     by mutual induction on the execution functions. 
     Since the execution functions make use of auxiliary semantic functions, 
     e.g. to read and write variables, 
     we first prove theorems about these functions. 
     These theorems also have essentially the form discussed above, 
     with the necessary adaptations.</p><p>It should be clear that the approach explained above 
     is more general than the <span class="v">DeadCodeEliminator</span> transformation, 
     and should be applicable to other Yul transformations as well. 
     To summarize, the approach is:</p><ol>
<li>Extend the transformation from syntactic to semantic entities.</li>
<li>Define equivalence relations over execution results.</li>
<li>Prove equivalence theorems for the auxiliary semantic functions.</li>
<li>Prove equivalence theorems for the execution functions.</li>
</ol><p>Some theorems about the auxiliary semantic semantics 
     can be proved as equalities rather than equivalences.</p><p>In the proofs, we generally enable 
     functions <span class="v">...-result-dead</span> that transform result values. 
     This exposes the error and non-error cases in the proof. 
     Perhaps there is a way to avoid enabling these functions, 
     and using suitable rules instead.</p><p>In the proofs, we generally enable 
     the equivalence relations <span class="v">...-result-okeq</span>. 
     This, together with the enabling of the <span class="v">...-result-dead</span> functions, 
     exposes the error and non-error cases. 
     Perhaps there is a way to avoid enabling these functions, 
     and using suitable rules instead.</p>
