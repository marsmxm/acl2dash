<p>Guessing the Type of a Newly Admitted Function</p><p>When a function is admitted to the logic, ACL2 tries to ``guess'' 
 what type of object it returns.  This guess is codified as a term that 
 expresses a property of the value of the function.  For <span class="v">app</span> the term 
 is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">OR</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> (APP X Y))
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (APP X Y) Y))</pre> 
 
 <p>which says that <span class="v">app</span> returns either a cons or its second argument. 
 This formula is added to ACL2's rule base as a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 rule.  Later we will discuss how rules are used by the ACL2 theorem prover. 
 The point here is just that when you add a definition, the database of rules 
 is updated, not just by the addition of the definitional axiom, but by several 
 new rules.</p>
