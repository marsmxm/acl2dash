<p>Wrapper for promoting begin/end generate blocks into genelements.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-GENELEMENT.html">vl-genelement</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>block  <a href="VL____VL-GENBLOCK.html">vl-genblock</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>This is a trivial wrapper for converting a <a href="VL____VL-GENBLOCK.html">vl-genblock</a>, 
              which represents a <span class="v">begin/end</span> generate construct, into a 
              standalone <span class="v">vl-genelement</span>.</p> 
 
              <p>Having this kind of wrapper is a bit ugly.  It might be nicer 
              looking to just have the name, location, and genelements for the 
              block right here, instead of relegating them to a <a href="VL____VL-GENBLOCK.html">vl-genblock</a>.</p> 
 
              <p>But having a wrapper gives us a really nice property: it 
              allows the ``implicit'' begin/end blocks for every kind of 
              generate construct to be treated in a completely uniform way. 
              That is: go look at <a href="VL____VL-GENCASE.html">vl-gencase</a>, <a href="VL____VL-GENIF.html">vl-genif</a>, etc. 
              You'll see that all of our branches are represented as explicit 
              <a href="VL____VL-GENBLOCK.html">vl-genblock</a>s.  This is really handy when it comes to 
              scoping.  We can ensure that all of these blocks have a name, and 
              we can deal with begin/end blocks and if/case blocks in a uniform 
              way in <a href="VL____SCOPESTACK.html">scopestack</a>s.  (We still have to handle generate 
              arrays separately, but there's no getting around that.)</p> 
 
              <p>We wouldn't be able to have this kind of uniformity if a 
              begin/end block just had its elements right here, because we 
              can't easily require that, e.g., a <a href="VL____VL-GENIF.html">vl-genif</a>'s <span class="v">then</span> 
              branch is <a href="VL____VL-GENELEMENT.html">vl-genelement</a> of subtype 
              <span class="v">:vl-genbegin</span>.</p>
