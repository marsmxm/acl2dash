<p>Elimination of wildcard equality operators, <span class="v">==?</span> and <span class="v">!=?</span>.</p><p>See SystemVerilog 2012, Section 11.4.6 Wildcard Equality Operators. 
In brief:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">a ==? b</span> determines whether a equals b, except that X and Z values in b 
act as wildcards.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">a !=? b</span> determines whether a does not equal b, except that X and Z 
values in b act as wildcards.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>These operators produce 1-bit, self-determined results.  If <span class="v">a</span> and 
<span class="v">b</span> are of unequal bit lengths, they are extended in the same manner as for 
the logical equality/inequality operators.  The result is <span class="v">X</span> if the <span class="v">a</span> 
operand contains any <span class="v">X</span> or <span class="v">Z</span> bit that is not being compared with a 
wildcard in the <span class="v">b</span> operand.</p> 
 
<p>These operators are basically fine and sensible when <span class="v">b</span> is a constant 
integer literal like <span class="v">4'b0101</span> or a weird integer like <span class="v">4'b01xx</span>. 
However, in the more general case where <span class="v">b</span> is some expression that is 
computed at runtime, these operators are fundamentally broken because they do 
not treat <span class="v">X</span> bits within <span class="v">b</span> as unknowns.  This poses problems for 
back-end tools like <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> that expect operators to behave 
monotonically.</p> 
 
<p>VL attempts to support simple uses of <span class="v">==?</span> and <span class="v">!=?</span>, i.e., when the 
right-hand argument is a constant or weird integer literal.  In this case, we 
can compute the mask of bits that we care about, and then consider the equality 
of the masked expressions.</p> 
 
<p>Ordering notes.  We expect that this transform should be run after sizing. 
Typically you will want to run it after sizing but before, e.g., truncating or 
splitting expressions.</p>
