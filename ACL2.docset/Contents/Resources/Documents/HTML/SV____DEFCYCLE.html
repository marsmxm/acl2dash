<p>Create a FSM from a design and a clock cycle specification, along with a signal name list.</p><p>Here is an example invocation of <span class="v">defcycle</span>:</p>

<p>This form creates a clock cycle FSM for the given design, setting the signal 
<span class="v">"my-clock"</span> to 0 in the first phase (at which time input signals are 
provided and outputs captured) and 1 in the second phase.  It also provides 
short names <span class="v">input0</span>, <span class="v">internal-val</span>, and <span class="v">output</span> for some signals 
that are given as hierarchical Verilog names.  The rest of the arguments shown 
are shown as their default values:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:rewrite-phases</span> if <span class="v">t</span> applies SVEX <a href="SV____REWRITING.html">rewriting</a> to the 
composed single phase FSM </li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:rewrite-cycle</span> if <span class="v">t</span> applies SVEX rewriting to the composed cycle 
FSM</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:cycle-simp</span> should be a <span class="v">svex-simpconfig</span> object, that is, <span class="v">t</span>, 
<span class="v">nil</span>, or a natural number, controlling simplification that is applied while 
composing the cycle. Here <span class="v">nil</span> signifies that no simplification is 
performed, <span class="v">t</span> signifies that constants are propagated and cheap 
simplifications applied to concatenation, select, and shift operations, and a 
natural number says that full rewriting will be applied during composition with 
that number as the iteration limit (the <span class="v">clk</span> argument of 
<span class="v">svex-rewrite-fncall</span>).</li> 
 
<li> <span class="v">:stobj</span> allows the event to use another stobj congruent to 
<span class="v">svtv-data</span> rather than <span class="v">svtv-data</span> itself.</li> 
</ul>
