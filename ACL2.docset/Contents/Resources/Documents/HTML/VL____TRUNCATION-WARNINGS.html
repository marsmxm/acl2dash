<p>Warnings about implicit truncation and extensions in assignments, 
casts, and so forth.</p><p>Truncation warnings are really, really good to have, and have found 
many bugs.  However, if we just issue a truncation warning about everything, we 
find that there are way too many nitpicky warnings and it's hard to go through 
them all.  So, we want to be clever and not warn in certain cases that we have 
seen where the truncation really doesn't matter.  Efficiency is of no concern 
because this is called so infrequently.</p> 
 
<p>Probably the biggest source of spurious truncation warnings is from the use 
of unsized numbers like 0 and 1.  It's a pretty good bet that any truncation 
from 32-bits to some other number of bits is no big deal and is just being 
caused by a unsized number.</p> 
 
<p>At any rate, we now have a notion of expression that are okay to truncate. 
We basically don't want to complain about things like</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign foo[3:0] = 0;              // 32 bits, but who cares, it fits

assign foo[3:0] = 5'd7;           // 5 bits, but who cares, it still fits

assign foo[3:0] = x0 ? 5'h0 :     // each are 5 bits, but who cares, they
                  x1 ? 5'h1 :     // still fit.
                  x2 ? 5'h2 :
                  ...
                  x14 ? 5'h14 :
                  5'h15;</pre>
