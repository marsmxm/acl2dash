<p>For ACL2(p): control the action taken when the thread limit is exceeded</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic relates to the experimental 
 extension of ACL2 supporting parallel execution and proof; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT-ERROR.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit-error</a> t)   ; cause error (<a href="ACL2____DEFAULT.html">default</a>)
(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT-ERROR.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit-error</a> nil) ; disable error and
                                             ; continue serially</pre> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM-TUTORIAL.html">parallelism-tutorial</a>, Section ``Another Granularity Issue 
 Related to Thread Limitations'', for an explanation of how the host Lisp can 
 run out of threads.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a> for further 
 details, including an explanation of how to manage the limit that triggers 
 this error.</p> 
 
 <p>The value of state global <span class="v">total-parallelism-work-limit-error</span> dictates 
 what occurs when the underlying runtime system runs reaches a limit on the 
 number of threads for parallel computation.  By default, when this limit is 
 reached, the ACL2(p) user will receive an error and computation will halt.  At 
 this point, the ACL2(p) user has the following options.</p> 
 
 <p>(1) Remove the limit by evaluating the following form.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a> :none)</pre> 
 
 <p>(2) Disable the error so that execution continues serially once the 
 available thread resources have been exhausted.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT-ERROR.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit-error</a> nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>(3) Increase the limit on number of threads that ACL2(p) is willing to 
 create, in spite of potential risk (see <a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a>).  In this case, the following query returns 
 the current limit.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____F-GET-GLOBAL.html">f-get-global</a> 'total-parallelism-work-limit)</pre> 
 
 <p>Then to increase that limit, evaluate the following form:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a> &lt;new-integer-value&gt;)</pre> 
 
 <p>For example, suppose that the value of <span class="v">total-parallelism-work-limit</span> 
 was originally 10,000.  Then evaluation of the following form increases that 
 limit to 13,000.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a> 13000)</pre>
