<p>Specifies the form of terms produced by an APT transformation.</p><p>BRIEF SUMMARY (details are skipped here but provided below).  When the 
     value of <span class="v">:untranslate</span> is <span class="v">:nice</span>, then a custom utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DIRECTED-UNTRANSLATE.html">directed-untranslate</a></span>, uses the original user-level <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">ACL2::term</a> (i.e., the body of a given definition) to direct creation of a 
     user-level transformed term from the translated, transformed term.  The 
     value <span class="v">:nice-expanded</span> is similar to <span class="v">:nice</span>, but may avoid some 
     attempts to re-introduce <span class="v">LET</span> bindings into the result.  If the value 
     is <span class="v">t</span>, then the translated, transformed term is subjected to ACL2's 
     usual <span class="v">untranslate</span> utility, rather than to that custom <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DIRECTED-UNTRANSLATE.html">directed-untranslate</a></span> utility.  Otherwise the value should be 
     <span class="v">nil</span>, in which case the result of simplifying the term is left alone 
     as a translated <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">ACL2::term</a>.  End summary.</p><p>Strictly speaking, the notion of an ACL2 <i>term</i> is quite restrictive. 
     However, ACL2 proof output avoids this notion of ``translated term'', 
     instead using a more liberal notion of ``untranslated'' term, in 
     which (for example) macros may appear and numbers are not quoted.  For 
     more about these two notions of term, see <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">ACL2::term</a>.</p><p>When a transformation produces a new term (typically, the body of a new 
     definition), the question arises: How should that term be presented? 
     There are two obvious choices: the new term can be translated or 
     untranslated.  For example, if a definition with body <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 1 x)</span> is 
     transformed to a definition in which <span class="v">2</span> is added to <span class="v">x</span>, the new 
     body would be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> '2 x)</span> as a translated term but would instead be 
     <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 2 x)</span> as an untranslated term (which avoids the rather ugly 
     single-quote mark).  Normally the untranslated term is to be preferred, 
     for readability.</p><p>But one can sometimes do better, with heuristics, than simply using the 
     most obvious untranslated term.  Suppose for example that the original 
     definition body is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FIRST.html">first</a> x))</span>.  The simplified body may be 
     created as the translated term <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> '2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span>, which naturally 
     ``untranslates'' to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span>.  The call of the macro, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____FIRST.html">first</a></span>, has been lost!  A nicer untranslation will attempt to preserve 
     more of the original untranslated term.  This ``nice'' untranslation would 
     thus be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FIRST.html">first</a> x))</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____DIRECTED-UNTRANSLATE.html">directed-untranslate</a> for 
     more information on such ``nice'' untranslation.</p><p>A potentially tricky problem is to reconstruct <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> expressions. 
     Suppose for example that the original body is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((z (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FIRST.html">first</a> x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1
     1 z))</span>.  A transformation might naturally produce a new body that is 
     <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span>.  A ``nice'' untranslation would ideally reconstruct 
     the <span class="v">let</span> expression <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((z (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FIRST.html">first</a> x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 2 z))</span>.  In some 
     cases, however, the transformation's heuristics might fail to do a good 
     job with such reconstructions.  Consider for example the body 
     <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((cost (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 0)) (inches 1)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> cost inches x))</span>.  a 
     transformation might naturally produce a term whose ``nice'' untranslation 
     is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((cost 1) (inches cost)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> cost inches x))</span>, yet it is 
     clearly undesirable to bind <span class="v">inches</span> to <span class="v">cost</span>.  In some cases, a 
     fourth option, the ``nice-expanded'' untranslation, would avoid any 
     attempt to reconstruct <span class="v">let</span> structure; in the example above, the 
     result might be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 1 1 x)</span>.</p><p>An untranslate specifier is passed as the <span class="v">:untranslate</span> input to a 
     transformation to control the form of terms produced.  An untranslate 
     specifier is one of the following, though some transformations might 
     support only some of these values, and the defaults may differ.</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="v">:nice</span> — the new term should be produced by a ``nice'' 
     heuristic untranslation that may respect the structure of the old body to 
     some reasonable extent, as discussed above.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">t</span> — the new term should be produced by the usual untranslation 
      procedure after transforming the input term.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">nil</span> — the new term should be produced without untranslation.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">:nice-expanded</span> — the new term should be produced by a ``nice'' 
     heuristic untranslation that may respect the structure of the old body to 
     some reasonable extent, but may avoid some attempts to reconstruct 
     <span class="v">let</span>/<span class="v">let*</span> structure, as discussed above.</li>
</ul>
