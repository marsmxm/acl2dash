<p>How to use <a href="VL2014____PS.html">ps</a> to build strings in a local context.</p><p>A disadvantage of using a stobj to represent the printer's state is 
that it is generally non-instantiable, which makes localized string building 
more difficult because printing from one function may interfere with printing 
from another.</p> 
 
<p>We provide two mechanisms for coping with this.</p> 
 
<p>The recommended approach is to use <a href="VL2014____WITH-LOCAL-PS.html">with-local-ps</a>, which in turn uses 
<span class="v">with-local-stobj</span> to give you a temporary <span class="v">ps</span> to work with.</p> 
 
<p>An alternative, which we do not often use, is to explicitly manage saving 
and restoring of the printer's state.  To support this, we provide some 
routines for saving and restoring configurations, and for resetting the 
printer's fields.</p>
