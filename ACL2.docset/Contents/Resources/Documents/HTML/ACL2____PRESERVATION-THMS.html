<p>Automation for proving that stobj-modifying functions preserve 
certain properties</p> 
<p>A major pain when programming in logic mode with stobjs is maintaining 
all the invariants necessary to prove guards.  We provide utilities to define a 
set of theorem templates and to prove those theorems of a function.</p> 
 
<p>Usage: 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-STOBJ-PRESERVATION-THMS.html">def-stobj-preservation-thms</a> fnname
   :stobjname my-stobj
   :templates my-stobj-pres-templates
   :omit (my-thm-template-x my-thm-template-y)
   :history my-stobj-pres-history)</pre> 
tries to prove a set of preservation theorems as stored in the table 
<span class="tt">my-st-pres-templates</span>.</p> 
 
<p>To add a new preservation theorem to the existing set, use, for example, 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ADD-STOBJ-PRESERVATION-THM.html">add-stobj-preservation-thm</a>
 nth-of-field-preserved
 :vars (id)
 :body `(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> id (my-index ,orig-stobj))
                 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> id (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> ',*fieldi* ,new-stobj))
                        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> id (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> ',*fieldi* ,orig-stobj))))
 :hints `(,@expand/induct-hints
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> stable-under-simplificationp
               '(:in-theory (<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> my-index))))
 :enable '(my-rule my-ruleset)
 :disable '(bad-rule other-rules)
 :rule-classes `(:rewrite (:linear :trigger-terms (,new-stobj)))
 :templates my-stobj-pres-templates
 :history my-stobj-pres-history)</pre> 
Certain placeholder variables can be used in the body, hints, enable, disable, 
and rule-classes fields: 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="tt">orig-stobj</span> is the variable denoting the original stobj before modification</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">new-stobj</span> is the term giving the modified stobj after the function 
call: for example, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 1 (modify-my-stobj my-stobj))</span>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">call</span> is the call of the function without the possible 
<span class="tt">mv-nth</span>, for example, <span class="v">(modify-my-stobj my-stobj)</span>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">expand/induct-hints</span> are a generated set of hints specific to each 
function for which the preservation theorem is to be proved, which expand and 
 (if recursive) induct on that function</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">fn</span> is the function being worked on</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">fn$</span> is the <span class="v">deref-macro-name</span> of that function, 
e.g. <span class="tt">binary-logior</span> if the <span class="tt">fn</span> were <span class="tt">logior</span>
</li> 
<li>
<span class="tt">formals</span> is the formals of the function, possibly with some 
modification to the names, but the same ones used in <span class="tt">call</span> and 
<span class="tt">new-stobj</span>.</li>
</ul> 
The <span class="tt">:vars</span> argument should be a list containing all of the variable 
names used in the theorem body; if the formals of the function contain any of 
these variables, we will use a modified list of formals that avoids them.</p> 
 
<p>One additional keyword argument, <span class="tt">:deps</span>, is allowed; if provided, 
this should be a list of stobj-preservation-thm template names such as 
<span class="tt">nth-node-preserved</span> above.  This signifies that this theorem should 
only be proved of functions for which the dependencies were also proved.</p> 
 
<p>Two additional macros, <span class="v">retroactive-add-stobj-preservation-thm</span> and 
<span class="v">retroactive-add-stobj-preservation-thm-local</span> are similar to 
<span class="v">add-stobj-preservation-thm</span> but additionally prove the new theorem for all 
existing functions for which other stobj-preservation-thms have already been 
proved, modulo the dependencies of the new theorem. The <span class="tt">-local</span> version 
makes the addition of the new theorem local to the current book or encapsulate, 
so that nonlocal calls of <span class="tt">def-stobj-preservation-thms</span> won't include 
it.</p> 
 
<p>All of these macros take keyword arguments <span class="tt">templates</span> and 
<span class="tt">history</span>, which should be symbols.  These symbols are the ACL2 table 
names in which the templates and usage history are stored.  (The history is 
used mainly for checking dependencies).  In order to simplify the usage of this 
utility, we supply a macro-generating macro: 
<pre class="code">(def-stobj-preservation-macros :name hello
                               :default-stobjname my-stobj
                               :templates my-templates-table
                               :history my-history-table)</pre> 
which defines simple wrapper macros 
<pre class="code">(def-hello-preservation-thms ...)
(add-hello-preservation-thm ...)
(retroactive-add-hello-preservation-thm ...)
(retroactive-add-hello-preservation-thm-local ...)</pre> 
that behave the same as the ones above, execpt that they don't take the 
<span class="tt">:templates</span> or <span class="tt">:history</span> arguments and they use 
<span class="tt">my-stobj</span> by default for <span class="tt">:stobjname</span>.</p>
