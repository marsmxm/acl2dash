<p>An ACL2 library for C.</p><p>This is a library that is being populated with:</p><ul>
<li>A formalization of (some aspects of) the C language.</li>
<li>A proof-generating C code generator for ACL2.</li>
</ul><p>The library may also extended with 
     more C-related formalizations and tools.</p><p>This library is based on the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html" target="_blank"><nobr>ISO/IEC 9899:2018 specification of C<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html"></nobr></a>. In the documentation of this library, 
     this standard is referenced as `[C]'; 
     sections are referenced 
     by appending their designations separated by colon, 
     e.g. `[C:6.2.6]' references Section 6.2.6; 
     paragraphs are referenced 
     by further appending their numbers separated by slash, 
     e.g. `[C:6.2.5/2]' references Paragraph 2 of Section 6.2.5. 
     These square-bracketed references may be used 
     as nouns or parenthetically.</p>
