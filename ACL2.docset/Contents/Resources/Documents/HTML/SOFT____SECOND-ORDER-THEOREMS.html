<p>Notion of second-order theorem.</p><p>A second-order theorem is an ACL2 theorem 
     that <a href="SOFT____FUNCTION-VARIABLE-DEPENDENCY.html">depends</a> on 
     one or more 
     <a href="SOFT____FUNCTION-VARIABLES.html">function variables</a>. 
     A second-order theorem is recorded implicitly, 
     not explicitly via <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFSOFT.html">defsoft</a></span> (which must not be used on theorems).</p><p>The second-order theorem is universally quantified 
     over the function variables that it depends on. 
     These function variables may be replaced by functions of matching arities, 
     obtaining a new theorem that is an 
     <a href="SOFT____SECOND-ORDER-THEOREM-INSTANCES.html">instance</a> 
     of the second-order theorem.</p><h3>Naming Conventions</h3><p>Including in the name of a second-order theorem, 
     between square brackets (in any order), 
     the function variables that the theorem depends on, 
     as in the examples in the SOFT documentation pages, 
     makes the dependency more explicit when referencing the theorem. 
     This naming convention may arise naturally 
     when the name of the theorem includes names of second-order functions that 
     follow the naming convention described in <a href="SOFT____SECOND-ORDER-FUNCTIONS.html">second-order-functions</a>, 
     or it may be explicitly followed when choosing the name of the theorem. 
     However, SOFT does not enforce this naming convention.</p>
