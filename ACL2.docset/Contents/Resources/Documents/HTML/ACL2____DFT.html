<p>Provide an explicit proof, for example chaining equalities</p><p><span class="v">Dft</span> is a proof-checking-like macro that allows you to chain 
 together equalities.  The name <span class="v">"dft"</span> is short for <span class="v">"defthm"</span>.  In 
 the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> see <span class="v">books/misc/dft-ex.lisp</span> for some 
 examples.</p> 
 
 <p>This tool has not been used in big proofs and probably can be improved 
 quite a bit.  The author encourages users to build improved versions.</p>
