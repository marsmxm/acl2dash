<p>Convention for packages of generated symbols</p><p>ACL2 utilities, whether defined in the ACL2 sources or in books, 
 will ideally provide the following default behavior when feasible: generated 
 symbols should be in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-PACKAGE.html">current-package</a></span>.  This is the ACL2 version of 
 the general principle enforced by almost all programming languages: names 
 introduced are, by default, in the current namespace.  We do not claim that 
 ACL2 currently adheres to this principle in all cases, but our hope that this 
 situation is improved over time.  Indeed, the utilities <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEQUIV.html">defequiv</a></span>, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFREFINEMENT.html">defrefinement</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></span> have been improved to conform to 
 this principle; see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-3.html">note-8-3</a>.  We hope that future utilities, not only 
 in ACL2 but also in the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>, will respect this principle 
 when feasible.  Conforming to this principle requires using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> 
 in a top level form to determine the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-PACKAGE.html">current-package</a></span> from <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> and then passing this package to functions that generate symbols.  The 
 section <span class="v">Symbol generation utilities</span> of ACL2 source file <span class="v">defthm.lisp</span> 
 contains utilities that are useful for generating symbols.  The code was 
 adapted from similar code in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2S.html">ACL2s</a></span>; see the community book 
 <span class="v">acl2s/utilities.lisp</span> which includes even more such utilities.  To see an 
 example of a utility that generates symbols in the current package, see 
 <span class="v">books/acl2s/defunc.lisp</span>, which contains the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2S____DEFUNC.html">ACL2s::defunc</a></span> 
 utility.  Other examples include <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEQUIV.html">defequiv</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFREFINEMENT.html">defrefinement</a></span> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></span> in <span class="v">defthm.lisp</span>.</p>
