<p>Simple check for self-assignments.</p><p>This is just a heuristic check that adds warnings if it sees 
assignments where some bit is on both the left- and right-hand sides.  For 
instance, it would warn about something like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign foo = a ? b : foo;</pre> 
 
<p>Such assignments might be combinational loops.  Of course, most 
combinational loops are not so simple, and this is just an extremely stupid 
check that will only catch the most obvious problems.</p> 
 
<p>I started by just seeing how bad it would be if I just gathered names on 
both side of the expression using vl-expr-names to gather up the names.  But 
that produced too much noise about assignments like <pre class="code">foo[1] =
foo[0]</pre>.</p> 
 
<p>So I now essentially collect up the bits of expressions, fudging for 
bit/part selects that aren't resolved.  If this is done only after ranges are 
resolved, it is still pretty good.  But it needs to be done before expressions 
are split, etc.</p> 
 
<p>This found only two things at Centaur, one of which was an assignment of an 
otherwise-unused wire to itself, and one which was not actually a problem because 
essentially it had the form:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign {foo, bar} = {baz, foo};</pre>
