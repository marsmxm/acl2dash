<p>Some contributors to the well-being of ACL2</p><p>The development of ACL2 was initially made possible by funding from 
 the U. S. Department of Defense, including ARPA and ONR.  We thank all the 
 organizations that have contributed support, including the following (in 
 alphabetical order).</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>AMD, for providing significant time over several years for Matt Kaufmann 
 to carry out ACL2 research, support, and development</li> 
 
 <li>Computational Logic, Inc. and its president, Don Good, where the first 
 eight years of ACL2 development occurred</li> 
 
 <li>Centaur Technology</li> 
 
 <li>DARPA</li> 
 
 <li>Digital Equipment Corporation</li> 
 
 <li>EDS, which provided some time for Matt Kaufmann's ACL2 work 1998-1999</li> 
 
 <li>ForrestHunt and, more generally, Warren A. Hunt, Jr. (see below)</li> 
 
 <li>IBM</li> 
 
 <li>Kestrel Institute</li> 
 
 <li>Kestrel Technology</li> 
 
 <li>NSF</li> 
 
 <li>ONR</li> 
 
 <li>Rockwell Collins</li> 
 
 <li>SRC</li> 
 
 <li>Sun Microsystems</li> 
 
 <li>University of Texas at Austin (in particular support to J Moore through the 
 Admiral B. R.  Inman Chair of Computing Theory)</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>We are especially grateful to Warren A. Hunt, Jr. for his unrivaled efforts 
 in securing support for the entire ACL2 research group at both Computational 
 Logic, Inc., and the University of Texas at Austin.  Without his efforts, we 
 would have spent less time working on the system and fewer students would have 
 been funded to apply it.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 was started in August, 1989 by Boyer and Moore working together.  They 
 co-authored the first versions of axioms.lisp and basis.lisp, with Boyer 
 taking the lead in the formalization of ``<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>'' and the most 
 primitive <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a> functions.  Boyer also had a significant hand in the 
 development of the early versions of the files interface-raw.lisp and 
 translate.lisp.  For several years, Moore alone was responsible for developing 
 the ACL2 system code, though he consulted often with both Boyer and Kaufmann. 
 In August, 1993, Kaufmann became jointly responsible with Moore for developing 
 the system.  Boyer has continued to provide valuable consulting on an informal 
 basis.</p> 
 
 <p>Bishop Brock was the heaviest early user of ACL2, and provided many 
 suggestions for improvements.  In particular, the <span class="v">:cases</span> and 
 <span class="v">:restrict</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> were his idea; he developed an early version of 
 congruence-based reasoning for Nqthm; and he helped in the development of some 
 early <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> about arithmetic.  In a demonstration of his courage and 
 faith in us, he pushed for Computational Logic, Inc., to agree to the Motorola 
 CAP contract — which required formalizing a commercial DSP in the 
 untested ACL2 — and moved to Scottsdale, AZ, to do the work with the 
 Motorola design team.  His demonstration of ACL2's utility was an inspiration, 
 even to those of us designing ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>John Cowles also helped in the development of some early <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> about 
 arithmetic, and also provided valuable feedback and bug reports.</p> 
 
 <p>Other early users of ACL2 at Computational Logic, Inc. helped influence its 
 development.  In particular, Warren Hunt helped with the port to Macintosh 
 Common Lisp, and Art Flatau and Mike Smith provided useful general 
 feedback.</p> 
 
 <p>Mike Smith helped develop the Emacs portion of the implementation of proof 
 trees.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 depends on the availability of robust Common Lisp implementations, so 
 we are grateful to the developers of those implementations.  Early in ACL2's 
 history, Bill Schelter made some enhancements to AKCL (now GCL) that helped to 
 enhance ACL2 performance in that Common Lisp implementation, and more 
 generally, responded helpfully to our bug reports.  Camm Maguire has since 
 provided wonderful GCL support, and has created a Debian package for ACL2 
 built on GCL.  Gary Byers and R. Matthew Emerson have continually improved 
 Clozure Common Lisp (CCL), often based on feedback from the ACL2 community. 
 We are also grateful to developers of other Common Lisp implementations.</p> 
 
 <p>Kent Pitman helped in our interaction with the ANSI Common Lisp 
 standardization committee, X3J13.</p> 
 
 <p>John Cowles helped with the port to Windows (98) by answering questions and 
 running tests.</p> 
 
 <p>Ruben Gamboa created a modification of ACL2 to allow reasoning about the 
 real numbers using non-standard analysis.  His work has been incorporated into 
 the ACL2 distribution; see <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Rob Sumners has made numerous useful suggestions.  In particular, he has 
 designed and implemented improvements for <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s and been key in our 
 development of locally-bound stobjs; see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-6.html">note-2-6</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Robert Krug has designed and implemented many changes in the vicinity of 
 the linear arithmetic package and its connection to type-set and rewrite.  He 
 was also instrumental in the development of <a href="ACL2____EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Pete Manolios has made numerous useful suggestions.  In particular, Pete 
 helped us to organize the first workshop and was a wonderful equal partner 
 with the two of us (Kaufmann and Moore) in producing the books that arose from 
 that workshop.  Pete and his student, Daron Vroon, provided the current 
 implementation of <a href="ACL2____ORDINALS.html">ordinals</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Jared Davis, Sol Swords, and David Rager have our gratitude for starting 
 the <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2+Books repository<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We thank David L. Rager for contributing an initial version of the support 
 for <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a> in an experimental extension of ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>Bob Boyer and Warren A. Hunt, Jr. developed a canonical representation for 
 ACL2 data objects, applicative hash tables, and a function memoization 
 mechanism to facilitate reuse of previously computed results.  Subsequently, 
 Jared Davis and Sol Swords made further contributions.  We thank them all for 
 this work, most of which has been incorporated into ACL2; see <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Other contributions to the ACL2 system continue to be made by members of the 
 ACL2 community.  In particular, following the first Developers Workshop in 
 May, 2017 through the time of this writing in November, 2019, such 
 contributors include Alessandro Coglio, Keshav Kini, Mihir Mehta, Pete 
 Manolios, and especially Sol Swords, while Eric Smith and many others have 
 suggested changes that we have implemented, often by providing helpful 
 examples.  The <a href="ACL2____RELEASE-NOTES.html">release-notes</a> detail such contributions as well as many 
 suggestions from the community for improvements that we ultimately 
 implemented.</p> 
 
 <p>We also thank the contributors to the ACL2 workshops for some suggested 
 improvements and for the extensive collection of publicly distributed 
 benchmark problems.  And we thank participants at the ACL2 seminar at the 
 University of Texas for useful feedback.  More generally, we thank the ACL2 
 community for feedback, contributed <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> (see <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>), 
 and their interest in the ACL2 project.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Regarding the documentation:</i></p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p>Bill Young wrote significant portions of the original 
 <span class="v">acl2-tutorial</span> section of the ACL2 documentation, including what is now 
 called <a href="ACL2____ALTERNATIVE-INTRODUCTION.html">alternative-introduction</a>.  This was an especially important task 
 in the early years when there was no guide for how to use ACL2 and we are very 
 grateful.  He, Bishop Brock, Rich Cohen, and Noah Friedman read over 
 considerable amounts of the documentation, and made many useful comments. 
 Others, particularly Bill Bevier and John Cowles, have also made useful 
 comments on the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Art Flatau helped develop the ACL2 markup language in which ACL2 <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> was originally developed, along with translators from that 
 language to Texinfo and HTML.  Michael ``Bogo'' Bogomolny created a search 
 engine, beginning with Version 2.6, and for that purpose modified the HTML 
 translator to create one file per topic (a good idea in any case).</p> 
 
 <p>Laura Lawless provided many hours of help in marking up appropriate parts 
 of the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> in typewriter font.</p> 
 
 <p>Noah Friedman developed an Emacs tool that helped us insert ``invisible 
 links'' into the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>, which improve the usability of that 
 documentation under HTML readers such as Mosaic.</p> 
 
 <p>Richard Stallman contributed a texinfo patch, to be found in the file 
 <span class="v">doc/texinfo.tex</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Jared Davis created the <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> system that is now the basis not only 
 for the ACL2 system <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> (file 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>), but also for the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> 
 documentation.</p>

 <p>We thank Blake Grugett for designing the current version of the ACL2 logo 
 (which for example appears on the ACL2 home page), based on an original design 
 created in the 1990s by Computational Logic, Inc.</p>
