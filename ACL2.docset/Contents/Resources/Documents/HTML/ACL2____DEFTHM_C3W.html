<p>Attempt to prove a theorem directly from previously-proved theorems.</p><p>The macro <span class="v">defthm&lt;w</span> takes the same arguments as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>: 
 a name, a form, and (optional) keyword arguments.  It also takes one additional 
 keyword argument, <span class="v">:prove</span>, discussed below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM_C3W.html">defthm&lt;w</a> name form
  :prove        p ; default :when-hints
  :rule-classes rule-classes
  :instructions instructions
  :hints        hints
  :otf-flg      otf-flg)</pre> 
 
 <p>More examples may be found in the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a>, 
 <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/auto-instance-tests.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The name ``<span class="v">defthm&lt;w</span>'' is intended to suggest using the world (w) to do 
 the proof: ``Prove this using input from the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.''</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Example Form:

; Prove car-cons by appealing to an already-proved theorem, car-cons:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM_C3W.html">defthm&lt;w</a> my-car-cons
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FIRST.html">first</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> a b)) a))</pre> 
 
 <p>The world is searched for previous theorems that, together, trivially imply 
 the given form.  If such theorems are found, then a <span class="v">defthm</span> event is 
 generated for the given form, with the given keyword arguments except for 
 <span class="v">:prove</span> and also excepting <span class="v">:hints</span>: rather, a value for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a></span> is generated that reference those previous theorems and that only allow 
 simplification in proofs of the subsequent goals, if any (so for example, not 
 destructor elimination or induction).  In this case, the supplied value of 
 <span class="v">:hints</span> (if any) is ignored.  Also see <a href="ACL2____PREVIOUS-SUBSUMER-HINTS.html">previous-subsumer-hints</a> 
 for documentation of the utility that generates the hints.</p> 
 
 <p>The behavior described above takes place with the default value of the 
 keyword argument, <span class="v">:prove</span>, which is <span class="v">:when-hints</span>.  With this default, 
 a call of <span class="v">defthm&lt;w</span> fails when suitable hints fail to be generated.  The 
 other two legal values for <span class="v">:prove</span> are <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">t</span>.  With 
 <span class="v">:prove nil</span>, no proof is attempted: instead, the event <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a>
 h)</span> is generated, where <span class="v">h</span> is the generated hints; note that <span class="v">h</span> is 
 nil when hints fail to be generated.  With <span class="v">:prove t</span>, the proof is 
 attempted even when no hints are generated; in that case, if <span class="v">:hints</span> are 
 supplied then they are used.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: This utility searches for previous <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> (including, of course, <span class="v">defthm</span> events generated 
 from macros such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFRULE.html">defrule</a></span>).  In particular, it does not search for 
 corollaries, termination or <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> theorems, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> 
 axioms.</p>
