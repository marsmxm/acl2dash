<p>For ACL2(p): using waterfall parallelism during book certification</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic relates to the experimental 
 extension of ACL2 supporting parallel execution and proof; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>There are books whose certification can be sped up significantly by using 
 waterfall parallelism.  (See <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>, including the caveat in its 
 "IMPORTANT NOTE".)  One such example in the ACL2 community books is 
 <span class="v">models/jvm/m5/apprentice.lisp</span>, which is typically excluded from 
 regressions because of how long it takes to certify.  In order to use 
 waterfall parallelism during certification of a book <span class="v">&lt;book-name&gt;.lisp</span> 
 using `make' (see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION.html">books-certification</a> and see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION-CLASSIC.html">books-certification-classic</a>), we recommend creating a file 
 <span class="v">&lt;book-name&gt;.acl2</span> that includes the following forms.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">#+acl2-par
(<a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a> t)

(<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> &lt;book-name&gt; ? t) ; other arguments may be preferable</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that there are books that will not certify when waterfall-parallelism 
 is enabled.  See file <span class="v">acl2-customization-files/README</span> for more 
 information, including how to certify essentially all books using waterfall 
 parallelism.</p>
