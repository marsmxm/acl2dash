<p>Define a function that is logically just NIL but has special extralogical behavior in FGL.</p><p> Because of FGL's <a href="FGL____BIND-VAR.html">bind-var</a> feature, it isn't always possible 
to define a function the way you want it to run in FGL: if you want to use 
<span class="v">bind-var</span>, then you must have a free variable in the RHS of the equation 
defining the function, which isn't allowed for ACL2 definitions.  Instead, you 
may provide a function definition without <span class="v">bind-var</span> calls, disable that 
definition for FGL (using <a href="FGL____DISABLE-DEFINITION.html">disable-definition</a>), and add an FGL rewrite 
rule with <a href="FGL____DEF-FGL-REWRITE.html">def-fgl-rewrite</a> that rewrites calls of the function to the body 
containing the bind-var calls.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">Def-fgl-program</span> provides a convenient macro for this. It wraps <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> such that all the usual arguments for define may be used.  It may also 
contain the additional keyword args <span class="v">:equiv</span>, giving the equivalence 
relation for the generated rewrite rule (defaulting to <span class="v">unequiv</span>), and 
<span class="v">:fgl-hints</span>, which allows hints to be passed to the proof for the rewrite 
rule.  Instead of providing the given function body as the body for the 
<span class="v">define</span>, it modifies it as follows: if <span class="v">:equiv</span> is provided, it searches 
the given body for calls of <span class="v">bind-var</span> and <span class="v">syntax-bind</span> and replaces 
them with their second arguments; otherwise, it just provides a body of <span class="v">nil</span>.</p>
