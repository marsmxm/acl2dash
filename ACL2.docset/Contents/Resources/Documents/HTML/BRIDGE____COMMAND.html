<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=BRIDGE____COMMAND">Click for Command in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Commands that the client sends to the bridge.</p><p>Each client is expected to send discrete <b>commands</b> that will 
be processed individually.</p> 
 
<p>The command format is identical to the <a href="BRIDGE____MESSAGE.html">message</a> format, and is meant 
to be very easy for the client to generate.  Clients should typically 
<span class="v">flush</span> the stream after printing their command to ensure that the server 
gets the input.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">type</span> of the command governs how the server should send the result 
back to the client.  The currently supported command types are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">LISP</span> -- send only the first return value, and just use <span class="v">prin1</span> to 
encode it.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">LISP_MV</span> -- send all of the return values, essentially by doing 
<span class="v">prin1</span> on the <span class="v">multiple-value-list</span> of the result.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">JSON</span> -- send the <a href="BRIDGE____JSON-ENCODING.html">json-encoding</a> of the first return value.  Note 
that this encoder only handles good ACL2 objects.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">JSON_MV</span> -- send the <a href="BRIDGE____JSON-ENCODING.html">json-encoding</a> of the 
<span class="v">multiple-value-list</span> of the result.  Note that this encoder only handles 
good ACL2 objects.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Adding other types would be trivial.  For instance, it might be useful to 
add pretty-printing.</p>
