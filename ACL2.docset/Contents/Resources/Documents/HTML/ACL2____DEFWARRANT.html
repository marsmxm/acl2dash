<p>Issue a warrant for a function so <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> can use it in proofs</p><p>It is best to be somewhat familiar with the documentation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> before reading this topic.</p> 
 
  <p>Before using <span class="v">defwarrant</span> or a utility like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a></span> that relies 
  on it:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "projects/apply/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
  <p>Several lemmas in that book are necessary for <span class="v">defwarrant</span> to prove 
  the theorems it must prove.</p> 
 
  <h3>Badges versus Warrants</h3> 
 
  <p>It is easy to confuse badges, which are issued by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFBADGE.html">defbadge</a></span>, with 
  warrants, which are issued by <span class="v">defwarrant</span>.  The thing to keep in mind is 
  that badges extend the syntax and evaluation capabilities of ACL2, while 
  warrants extend the proof theory.  Some user-defined function symbols may be 
  given badges even if they are in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode (see <a href="ACL2____MIXED-MODE-FUNCTIONS.html">mixed-mode-functions</a>).  If <span class="v">fn</span> has a badge, you are allowed to write 
  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a1 ... an))</span> and expect it evaluate ``correctly'' at 
  the top level of the ACL2 read-eval-print loop, just as you expect <span class="v">(fn a1
  ... an)</span> to evaluate.  But you cannot <i>prove</i> anything interesting 
  about <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a1 ... an))</span> without the warrant for <span class="v">fn</span>.  A 
  badged but unwarranted function symbol might as well be undefined as far as 
  the prover is concerned.  Warrants connect the quoted symbol to the axiomatic 
  behavior of <span class="v">apply$</span>, in particular, they constrain <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a>
  a1 ... an))</span> to be <span class="v">(fn a1 ... an)</span> under certain conditions.  Obviously, 
  the very first requirement on <span class="v">fn</span> to have a warrant is that <span class="v">fn</span> must 
  be in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.  But there are other requirements because 
  <span class="v">defwarrant</span> must make sure the extended proof theory is consistent.</p> 
 
  <h3>Requirements of <span class="v">Defwarrant</span>
</h3> 
 
  <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a> fn)</pre> 
 
  <p>where <span class="v">fn</span> is a defined function name.  This command analyzes the body 
  of <span class="v">fn</span> to determine whether it satisfies certain stringent syntactic and 
  semantic conditions that allow the ACL2 proof theory to be extended so that 
  the prover can simplify forms like <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn ...)</span>.  The syntactic 
  conditions are actually those of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFBADGE.html">defbadge</a></span>, which <span class="v">defwarrant</span> 
  essentially invokes if <span class="v">fn</span> is not already badged.  But below we describe 
  all the conditions  those enforced by <span class="v">defbadge</span> and those unique 
  to <span class="v">defwarrant</span>  since many users use <span class="v">defwarrant</span> to issue both 
  a badge and a warrant.</p> 
 
  <p>Basic conditions include that <span class="v">fn</span> is in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>-mode, does 
  not have <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> or any <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> in its signature, and that its 
  justification (i.e., the measure, well-founded relation, and domain predicate 
  used to admit <span class="v">fn</span>) be expressible without any reference to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EV_42.html">ev$</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42-USERFN.html">apply$-userfn</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <p><span class="v">Defwarrant</span> imposes some additional conditions on <span class="v">fn</span>, but exactly 
  what those conditions are depends on a certain ``reachability'' test detailed 
  in the section titled <b>The ``Reachability'' Test</b> in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFBADGE.html">defbadge</a></span>. 
  Roughly speaking the test is whether <span class="v">apply$</span> is ancestral in <span class="v">fn</span>, 
  meaning <span class="v">apply$</span> is somehow involved in the definition of <span class="v">fn</span> or the 
  functions it calls.</p> 
 
  <p>If the reachability test succeeds  colloquially, if <span class="v">fn</span> depends 
  on <span class="v">apply$</span>  then <span class="v">defwarrant</span> imposes the following additional 
  conditions in order to issue a warrant.</p> 
 
  <p><i>(a)</i> If <span class="v">fn</span> is recursive it must not be part of a mutually 
  recursive clique and its measure must be of type <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a></span> or be a 
  lexicographic combination of natural numbers as defined by the <span class="v">llist</span> 
  function in the Community Books at <span class="v">books/ordinals/</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><i>(b)</i> Every function called in the body of <span class="v">fn</span>, except <span class="v">fn</span> 
  itself, must already have a <a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a>.  If some subfunction doesn't 
  already have a badge, <span class="v">defwarrant</span> will signal an error and report the 
  unbadged function.  You will have to call <span class="v">defwarrant</span> on that function 
   and that call must succeed  before any function using it is 
  successfully warranted.</p> 
 
  <p><i>(c)</i> It must be possible for each formal of <span class="v">fn</span> to be assigned 
  one of three <a href="ACL2____ILK.html">ilk</a>s, <span class="v">:FN</span>, <span class="v">:EXPR</span>, or <span class="v">NIL</span>, as described 
  below.  The basic idea is that a formal can be assigned ilk <span class="v">:FN</span> (or ilk 
  <span class="v">:EXPR</span>) iff it is sometimes passed into a <span class="v">:FN</span> (or <span class="v">:EXPR</span>) slot 
  in the body of <span class="v">fn</span> and is never passed into any other kind of slot.  A 
  formal can be be assigned ilk <span class="v">NIL</span> iff it is never passed into a slot of 
  ilk <span class="v">:FN</span> or <span class="v">:EXPR</span>, i.e., if it is used as an ``ordinary'' object. 
  We are more precise below.</p> 
 
  <p><i>(d)</i> Every <span class="v">:FN</span> and <span class="v">:EXPR</span> slot of every function called in 
  the body of <span class="v">fn</span> is occupied either by a formal of <span class="v">fn</span> of the same ilk 
  or, in the case of calls of functions other than <span class="v">fn</span>, a quoted <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a> function symbol or quoted tame (preferably well-formed) <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
  object.</p> 
 
  <p>This completes the list of additional restrictions imposed by 
  <span class="v">defwarrant</span> on <span class="v">fn</span>, when <span class="v">apply$</span> is reachable from <span class="v">fn</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>If the reachability test fails  colloquially, if <span class="v">fn</span> does not 
  depend on <span class="v">apply$</span>  then <span class="v">defwarrant</span> just checks that <span class="v">fn</span> 
  does not call any of a few functions that <span class="v">apply$</span> is prohibited from 
  running.  Among those blacklisted functions are <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></span> and other 
  functions requiring a trust tag.  For a list of the blacklisted functions see 
  the value of <span class="v">*blacklisted-apply$-fns*</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>Note that the restrictions imposed on functions from which <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  cannot be reached are comparatively generous.  If <span class="v">fn</span> does not depend on 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> then <span class="v">fn</span> can be warranted despite (a) being defined mutually 
  recursively or with an arbitrary ordinal measure, or (b) calling unbadged or 
  unbadgeable functions  including for example, functions that use local 
  <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s (see <a href="ACL2____WITH-LOCAL-STOBJ.html">with-local-stobj</a>s).</p> 
 
  <p>Regardless of whether <span class="v">apply$</span> is reachable, if the requisite 
  conditions are not met, <span class="v">defwarrant</span> causes an error.</p> 
 
  <p>If the requisite conditions are met, <span class="v">defwarrant</span> obtains or constructs 
  the <a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> for <span class="v">fn</span>, setting the arity and out arity appropriately 
  and setting the ilks field to the list of computed ilks (or to <span class="v">T</span> if 
  every formal has ilk <span class="v">NIL</span>).  The generated badge is stored for the future 
  use of <span class="v">defwarrant</span>.  See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFBADGE.html">defbadge</a></span> for a brief discussion of how 
  ilks are computed.</p> 
 
  <p>Furthermore, <span class="v">defwarrant</span> generates the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a></span> for <span class="v">fn</span>. 
  The name of that 0-ary function will be <span class="v">APPLY$-WARRANT-fn</span>.  Calls of 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> on <span class="v">'fn</span> in proof attempts can only be simplified if the 
  warrant hypothesis, <span class="v">(APPLY$-WARRANT-fn)</span>, <i>aka</i> ``the warrant,'' is 
  among the hypotheses of the conjecture being proved.  The warrant specifies 
  the values of both <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> 'fn)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn ...)</span>, including the 
  tameness requirements imposed on <span class="v">apply$</span>.  (The warrant explicitly 
  specifies the values of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE-USERFN.html">badge-userfn</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42-USERFN.html">apply$-userfn</a></span> and 
  then <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span> proves rewrite rules to make calls of <span class="v">badge</span> and 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> simplify accordingly.)</p> 
 
  <p>If a warrant is issued for <span class="v">fn</span>, then <span class="v">defwarrant</span> also extends 
  ACL2's evaluation theory (but not its proof theory) so that the warrant 
  hypothesis is assumed true in that theory, allowing calls of <span class="v">badge</span> and 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> to be evaluated in the evaluation theory (but not in the proof 
  theory).  See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a></span> for details.</p> 
 
  <p>You might worry that theorems burdened by warrants are vacuously valid 
  because it might be impossible to satisfy all the warrant hypotheses.  You 
  needn't worry about this.  <i>There is a model of <span class="v">apply$</span> and all of its 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SCION.html">scion</a></span>s that makes every warrant issued by <span class="v">defwarrant</span> valid.</i> 
  The proof of this is sketched in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/papers/apply/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>``Limited 
  Second-Order Functionality in a First-Order Setting''<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/papers/apply/index.html"></nobr></a> by Matt Kaufmann 
  and J Strother Moore and fully fleshed out in the comment titled <span class="tt">Essay on 
  Admitting a Model for Apply$ and the Functions that Use It</span> in the ACL2 
  source file <span class="v">apply-raw.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><span class="v">Defwarrant</span> also proves that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FN-EQUAL.html">fn-equal</a></span> is a congruence 
  relation for each <span class="v">:FN</span> position of <span class="v">fn</span>.</p>
