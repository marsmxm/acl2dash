<p>Post-translation step: 
          remove calls of the array writing methods.</p><p>ATJ's ACL2-to-Java translation 
     turns calls of the ACL2 functions that model array writes 
     into calls of corresponding Java methods that make destructive writes. 
     This keeps the translation simple, 
     also because the array writing methods return the (modified) array, 
     thus maintaining a functional programming style.</p><p>However, in idiomatic Java, an array write should be an assignment, 
     whose returned value is normally discarded 
     by turning the assignment into a statement via an ending semicolon. 
     The goal of this post-translation step is to suitably replace 
     calls of the array writing methods (along with some surrounding code) 
     into assignment expression statements. 
     This is essentially ``inlining'' these method calls.</p><p>For now we make the following transformations 
    in this post-translation step:</p><ul>
<li>
<p>We turn assignment expression statements of the form</p>
<pre class="code">a = &lt;array-write-method&gt;(a, i, x);</pre>
<p>into assignment expressions statements of the form</p>
<pre class="code">a[i] = x;</pre>
<p>ATJ's ACL2-to-Java translation produces statements of the first kind, 
       when translating terms of the form</p>
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> (... (a (&lt;array-write-function&gt; a i x)) ...) ...)</pre>
<p>Since the array writing method makes the assignment, 
       the second kind of assignment is equivalent to the first one. 
       The first one just ends up assigning (the modified) a to itself. 
       Here `modified' refers to the content of the array, 
       not the immutable reference that is actually in <span class="v">a</span>.</p>
<p>Because of the single-threaded array analysis, 
       the Java variable <span class="v">a</span> on the left-hand side 
       should be the same as the first argument of the method call 
       (when this is a variable at all), 
       because the single-threadedness should ensure that 
       array variables can be reused.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We turn return statements of the form</p>
<pre class="code">return &lt;array-write-method&gt;(a, i, x);</pre>
<p>(where <span class="v">a</span> is a variable) into two-statement blocks of the form</p>
<pre class="code">a[i] = x;
return a;</pre>
<p>ATJ's ACL2-to-Java translation produces statements of the first kind, 
       when a function ends its execution 
       with a call of the form <span class="v">(&lt;array-write-function&gt; a i x)</span>. 
       The array write method destructively updates the array and returns it. 
       Thus, we can ``inline'' the method call here.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>The two cases above are not 
     the only kind of occurrences of the array writing methods 
     in the Java code produced by ATJ's ACL2-to-Java translation. 
     Other kinds of occurrences will be handled in the future.</p>
