<p>Adds a rule to the Adviser database</p><pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ADVISER____DEFADVICE.html">defadvice</a> rule-name term
  :rule-classes rule-classes)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">name</span> is a new symbolic name See <a href="ACL2____NAME.html">ACL2::name</a>, <span class="v">term</span> is a term 
 alleged to be a useful piece of advice, and <span class="v">rule-classes</span> describe the 
 type of advice being added and when to suggest hints of this nature.</p> 
 
 <p>When Adviser is first loaded, no rules are installed in its database, so it 
 will never suggest any hints.  To make Adviser useful, rules must be added to 
 it using defadvice.  In principle, many types of advice could be added to the 
 Adviser service, and in the future other classes of advice might be added. 
 But, for now, the only understood rule class is :pick-a-point.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ADVISER____PICK-A-POINT.html">pick-a-point</a> for documentation and examples about 
 :pick-a-point rules.</p>
