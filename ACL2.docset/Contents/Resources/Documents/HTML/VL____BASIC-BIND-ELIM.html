<p>Handling of basic SystemVerilog <span class="v">bind</span> constructs.</p><p>See SystemVerilog-2012 23.11, <i>Binding auxiliary code to scopes 
or instances</i>.  Bind constructs allow you to essentially inject module 
instances into other modules at run-time.</p> 
 
<p>This transform, as part of the initial <a href="VL____ANNOTATE.html">annotate</a> process, is meant to 
handle ``global'' (our word) <span class="v">bind</span> statements—those that add code to 
whole modules/interfaces—but not (most) ``local'' binds that tamper with 
a particular module instance.  For instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module wheelChecker (...); ... endmodule

module beetle (...); ... endmodule
module transAm (...); ... endmodule

module top ;

   beetle herbie1(...);
   beetle herbie2(...);

   transAm kit();
   transAm kat();

   // This is a 'global' bind because it affects all beetles
   // We support this here.
   bind beetle wheelChecker frontWheelCheck(...);

   // This is a 'local' bind because it only affects kit and not kat.
   // We don't support these kinds of binds.
   bind transAm: kit wheelChecker frontWheelCheck(...);

endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Global binds are easier (and perhaps more efficient) to support because we 
can add them without having to ``fork'' the definitions of modules.  That is, 
in the above example, adding the <span class="v">wheelChecker</span> to only <span class="v">kit</span> and not 
<span class="v">kat</span> means that we need to fork <span class="v">transAm</span> into two separate modules: one 
with the extra binding and one without.  It seems tricky to do this 
efficiently.</p> 
 
<p>We actually <i>do</i> support a very limited subset of local binds that may 
as well have been global.  That is, if some particular module <span class="v">foo</span> is only 
ever instantiated in a single place, then a local bind that adds submodules to 
that single instance may as well have been a global bind that adds its 
submodules to <span class="v">foo</span>.  Note that this is a very limited facility, mainly 
intended to support bind statements that are applied to very high-level 
modules.</p> 
 
<p>Ordering notes.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We should run this after preliminaries like <a href="VL____MAKE-IMPLICIT-WIRES.html">make-implicit-wires</a> so 
that scopes are correct.  We rely on scopes making sense in order to look up 
which instances a non-global <span class="v">bind</span> is referring to.</li> 
 
<li>We should run this before <a href="VL____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> so that any bindings we 
introduce will get resolved as per usual.  We should also run this before <a href="VL____BASICSANITY.html">basicsanity</a> so that we check namespaces correctly and to report unhandled 
<span class="v">bind</span> statements easily.</li> 
 
</ul>
