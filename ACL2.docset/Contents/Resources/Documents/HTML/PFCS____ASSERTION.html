<p>Fixtype of semantic assertions.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>asg — <a href="PFCS____ASSIGNMENT.html">assignment</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>constr — <a href="PFCS____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>These are the assertions mentioned in <a href="PFCS____SEMANTICS-DEEPLY-EMBEDDED.html">semantics-deeply-embedded</a>. 
     They are essentially logical formulas, 
     asserting that the mathematical semantic function 
     returns the boolean `true' on given inputs.</p><p>The components of the assertions defined here 
     correspond to the inputs of the mathematical semantic function 
     sketched in <a href="PFCS____SEMANTICS-DEEPLY-EMBEDDED.html">semantics-deeply-embedded</a>, 
     with the exception of the constraint system. 
     This is left implicit in the assertions, 
     because it would be the same in all of them, 
     and so it is provided externally; 
     see the definition of the semantic function 
     in terms of the proof system.</p>
