<p>Disambiguation page for <i>type</i>-related concepts.</p><p>The word <b>type</b> might mean many things in ACL2.</p> 
 
<dl> 
 
<dt>Built-in Types</dt> 
 
<dd>ACL2 can reason about and compute with certain different kinds of objects, 
such as <a href="ACL2____NUMBERS.html">numbers</a>, <a href="ACL2____STRINGS.html">strings</a>, <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>, and <a href="ACL2____CONSES.html">conses</a>. 
See <a href="ACL2____About_02Types.html">About Types</a> for basic background on the different kinds of ACL2 
objects.</dd> 
 
<dt>User-Defined Types</dt> 
 
<dd>When modeling systems with ACL2, you may often want to introduce certain 
concepts as new data types.  For instance, if you are modeling a network, you 
might want <span class="v">host</span> and <span class="v">connection</span> objects.  ACL2 does not directly 
support introducing new types.  Instead, such types are usually ``emulated'' by 
introducing a new <i>recognizer</i> function, say <span class="v">hostp</span>, and perhaps some 
related <i>constructor</i> and <i>accessor</i> functions, say <span class="v">make-host</span> 
and <span class="v">host-&gt;name</span>.  Macro libraries can help to assist with introducing 
common types.  See for instance <a href="ACL2____STD_F2UTIL.html">std/util</a>, <a href="ACL2____DEFDATA.html">defdata</a>, 
or <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a>.</dd> 
 
<dt>Type Declarations</dt> 
 
<dd>For more efficient Common Lisp execution, ACL2 functions can be annotated 
with Common Lisp type specifiers (see <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a>) that may boost 
performance by reducing run-time type checking.  This mechanism is integrated 
with ACL2's <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> mechanism, so you can prove your type declarations are 
correct.  See also <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a>, and also <a href="ACL2____PATBIND-THE.html">patbind-the</a>.</dd> 
 
<dt>Type Prescriptions</dt> 
 
<dd>ACL2 includes a limited but efficient ``<a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> reasoning engine 
for determining whether objects are of certain <b>built-in</b> types.  This 
engine can be extended with <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules.  Such rules are 
often inferred automatically when new functions are introduced with <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a>.  Type-set reasoning can assist other reasoning engines like <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a>, <a href="ACL2____LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">linear-arithmetic</a>, and rewriting.  Type-set 
information is stored in a <a href="ACL2____TYPE-ALIST.html">type-alist</a> data structure.</dd> 
 
<dt>Tau</dt> 
 
<dd>ACL2 includes another reasoning engine, the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>, for 
reasoning about type-like predicates.  Unlike <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a>, Tau can also be 
used for reasoning about <b>user-defined types</b>, and can also carry out 
certain interval arithmetic reasoning.  See the <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-TAU-SYSTEM.html">introduction-to-the-tau-system</a> for more information about Tau.</dd>
