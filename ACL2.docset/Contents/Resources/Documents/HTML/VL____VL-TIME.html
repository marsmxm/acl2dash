<p>Representation of time amounts like <span class="v">45.12ns</span>.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-VALUE.html">vl-value</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>quantity — <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>An ACL2 string with the amount.  In practice, the amount should 
               match either <span class="v">unsigned_number</span> or <span class="v">fixed_point_number</span>, 
               e.g., <span class="v">"3"</span> or <span class="v">"45.617"</span>.  We don't try to process 
               this further because (1) we don't expect it to matter for much, 
               and (2) ACL2 doesn't really support fixed point numbers.</dd> 
 
<dt>units — <a href="VL____VL-TIMEUNIT-P.html">vl-timeunit-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The kind of time unit this is, e.g., seconds, milliseconds, 
               microseconds, ...</dd> 
 
</dl><p>We barely support this.  You should probably not rely on our 
          current representation, since we will almost certainly want to change 
          it as soon as we do anything with time units.</p>
