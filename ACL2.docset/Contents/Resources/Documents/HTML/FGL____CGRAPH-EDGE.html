<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>match-vars — <a href="CMR____PSEUDO-VAR-LIST.html">pseudo-var-list</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The subset of variables bound in rule.match that we should try 
                to compute values for in order to apply the rule. When building 
                the cgraph, we always add a new edge with a single match var, but 
                if two edges are added with the same rule and compatible substitutions, 
                then we replace the two edges with a single edge with the union 
                of their match-vars.</dd>

<dt>subst — <a href="FGL____FGL-OBJECT-BINDINGS.html">fgl-object-bindings</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Substitution to be applied to match terms of the rule. This is a source 
           of confusion because the match itself is a substitution, but each term 
           within it usually contain references to variables: usually the assigned-var, 
           but also sometimes e.g. the key for an <span class="v">assoc</span>-like operation, array 
           index, etc.</dd>
