<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=C____ATC-PRETTY-PRINTER">Click for Atc-pretty-printer in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A pretty-printer of C abstract syntax for ATC.</p><p>This pretty-printer produces text 
     in the form of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSGP.html">msgp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSG-LISTP.html">msg-listp</a></span> values. 
     The latter generally consist of lines of text; 
     that is always the case at the top level, 
     i.e. a C translation unit is turned into a list of lines. 
     Some pretty-printing functions produce <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSGP.html">msgp</a></span> values 
     that other pretty-printing functions 
     incorporate into larger text. 
     In the pretty-printing functions, 
     we consistently use the result names 
     <span class="v">part</span> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSGP.html">msgp</a></span> values that are part of lines, 
     <span class="v">parts</span> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSG-LISTP.html">msg-listp</a></span> values that are lists of parts of lines, 
     <span class="v">line</span> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSGP.html">msgp</a></span> values that are individual lines, and 
     <span class="v">lines</span> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSG-LISTP.html">msg-listp</a></span> values that are multiple lines.</p><p>A separate function writes the lines for a C translation unit 
     to an output channel, which is associated to a file.</p><p>Currently in our abstract syntax there is no distinction between 
     translation units and preprocessing translation units. 
     However, it is the latter, not the former, 
     that must be pretty-printed to files 
     [C:5.1.1.2].</p><p>We use some <a href="C____ATC-PRETTY-PRINTING-OPTIONS.html">pretty-printing options</a> that influence some aspects of the pretty-printing. 
     For now only a simple option is supported, 
     but more options may be supported.</p>
