<p>Add name or list of names to the list of untouchable symbols</p><p>Untouchables are functions that cannot be called, as well as <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global variables (see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING-WITH-STATE.html">programming-with-state</a>) that cannot be 
 modified or unbound.  Macros can also be untouchable in some sense; see <a href="ACL2____DEFMACRO-UNTOUCHABLE.html">defmacro-untouchable</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a> my-var nil)
(<a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a> set-mem t)

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a> name{s} fn-p)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">name{s}</span> is a non-<span class="v">nil</span> symbol or a non-<span class="v">nil</span> true list of 
 symbols, and <span class="v">fn-p</span> is any value (but generally <span class="v">nil</span> or <span class="v">t</span>).  If 
 <span class="v">name{s}</span> is a symbol it is treated as the singleton list containing that 
 symbol.  The effect of this event is to union the given symbols into the list 
 of ``untouchable variables'' in the current world if <span class="v">fn-p</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
 else to union the symbols into the list of ``untouchable functions''.  This 
 event is redundant if every symbol listed is already a member of the 
 appropriate untouchables list (variables or functions).</p> 
 
 <p>There is a further restriction on which function names may be made 
 untouchable: If a function symbol, <span class="v">g</span>, may be introduced into a proof by a 
 metatheorem (via the metafunction or the hypothesis metafunction) or by a 
 clause processor and the metatheorem or clause processor has a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WELL-FORMEDNESS-GUARANTEE.html">well-formedness-guarantee</a></span> then <span class="v">g</span> may not be made untouchable.</p> 
 
 <p>As noted above, macros may not be made directly untouchable; the macro 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFMACRO-UNTOUCHABLE.html">defmacro-untouchable</a></span> is provided for that purpose.  Thus, it is an 
 error to evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a> F t)</span> if <span class="v">F</span> is already a macro 
 name, and it is also an error to define <span class="v">F</span> as a macro when <span class="v">F</span> has been 
 made an untouchable function using <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a> F t)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>When a symbol is on the untouchables list it is syntactically illegal for 
 any event to call a function of that name, if <span class="v">fn-p</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>, or to 
 change the value of a state global variable of that name, if <span class="v">fn-p</span> is 
 <span class="v">nil</span>.  Thus, the effect of pushing a function symbol, <span class="v">name</span>, onto 
 untouchables is to prevent any future event from using that symbol as a 
 function, or as a state global variable (according to <span class="v">fn-p</span>).  This is 
 generally done to ``fence off'' some primitive function symbol from ``users'' 
 after the developer has used the symbol freely in the development of some 
 higher level mechanism.</p>
