<p>Popping out of an Inductive Proof</p><p>Recall that our induction scheme (click <a href="ACL2____The_02Proof_02of_02the_02Associativity_02of_02App.html">here</a> to revisit it) had two 
 cases, the induction step (<span class="v">Subgoal *1/2</span>) and the base case (<span class="v">Subgoal
 *1/1</span>).  Both have been proved!</p>
