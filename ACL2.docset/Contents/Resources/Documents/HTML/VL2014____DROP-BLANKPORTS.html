<p>Eliminate "blank ports" from modules and delete all corresponding 
arguments from module instances.</p><p>For background on blank ports and argument see <a href="VL2014____VL-PORT-P.html">vl-port-p</a> and 
<a href="VL2014____VL-PLAINARG-P.html">vl-plainarg-p</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Blank ports are completely useless.  This transform removes blank ports from 
all modules and simultaneously removes all arguments given to blank ports from 
all instances of all modules.</p> 
 
<p>Prerequisites.  We expect to only see plain argument lists, i.e., <a href="VL2014____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> should have already been run.  There are no other requirements. 
However, note that we do not respect <a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-_E3HANDS-OFFP.html">vl-module-&gt;hands-offp</a> since it does 
not seem legitimate to do so: the correctness of this transformation requires 
that the instances throughout every module be updated.</p> 
 
<p>We may add fatal warnings if we find instances of undefined modules or arity 
mismatches.  But we do <i>not</i> add any warnings about connections to blank 
ports because we expect <a href="VL2014____ARGRESOLVE.html">argresolve</a> to have done that.</p>
