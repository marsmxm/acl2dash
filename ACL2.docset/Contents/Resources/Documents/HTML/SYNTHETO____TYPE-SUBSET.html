<p>Fixtype of Syntheto type subsets.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>supertype — <a href="SYNTHETO____TYPE.html">type</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>variable — <a href="SYNTHETO____IDENTIFIER.html">identifier</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>restriction — <a href="SYNTHETO____EXPRESSION.html">expression</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>witness — <a href="SYNTHETO____MAYBE-EXPRESSION.html">maybe-expression</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>This is a subset of another type. 
     It consists, syntactically, of the supertype 
     and an expression that must be boolean-valued 
     and must have a single free variable of the supertype.</p><p>This is related to the invariants of type products, 
     but it is convenient to have (optional) invariants in the type products, 
     rather than forcing the user to 
     give a name to the product without invariant 
     and then define the subtype of the product type.</p><p>The field <span class="v">variable</span> must match the free variable in <span class="v">restriction</span>.</p><p>A type subset also includes an optional witness expression. 
     If present, this must be a ground expression 
     that evaluates to a value satisfying the restriction. 
     If absent, such an expression must be inferred in some way. 
     This witness is needed to show that the subtype is inhabited, 
     which is used to defined the fixer of the ACL2 fixtype 
     generated for the Syntheto fixtype.</p>
