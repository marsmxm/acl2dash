<p>Make a rule to restrict generalizations</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a general discussion of rule classes, 
 including how they are used to build rules from formulas and a discussion of 
 the various keywords in a rule class description.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Example:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> integer-listp-rev
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____INTEGER-LISTP.html">integer-listp</a> x)
           (<a href="ACL2____INTEGER-LISTP.html">integer-listp</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x)))

General Form:
any theorem</pre> 
 
 <p>To use a <span class="v">:generalize</span> rule, the system waits until it has decided to 
 generalize some term, <span class="v">term</span>, by replacing it with some new variable 
 <span class="v">v</span>.  If any <span class="v">:generalize</span> formula can be instantiated so that some 
 non-variable subterm becomes <span class="v">term</span>, then that instance of the formula is 
 added as a hypothesis.  Thus for the example above, if the term <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x2)</span> 
 is generalized to the variable <span class="v">rv</span> during a proof, then the following is 
 added as a hypothesis when generalizing to a new goal.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____INTEGER-LISTP.html">integer-listp</a> x2)
         (<a href="ACL2____INTEGER-LISTP.html">integer-listp</a> rv))</pre> 
 
 <p>At the moment, the best description of how ACL2 <span class="v">:generalize</span> rules are 
 used may be found in the discussion of ``Generalize Rules,'' page 248 of A 
 Computational Logic Handbook, or ``Generalization,'' page 132 of 
 ``Computer-Aided Reasoning: An Approach.''  Also see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a> for detailed tutorial on using ACL2 to 
 prove theorems, which includes some discussion of generalization.</p>
