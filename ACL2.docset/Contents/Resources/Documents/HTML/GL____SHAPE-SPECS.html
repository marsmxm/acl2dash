<p>Simplified symbolic objects useful for coverage proofs in GL.</p><p>Shape specifiers are a simplified format of GL symbolic objects, 
capable of representing Booleans, numbers, conses, free variables, and function 
calls.  While less expressive than full-fledged symbolic objects, shape spec 
objects make it easier to prove coverage lemmas necessary for proving theorems 
by symbolic simulation.  Here, we document common constructions of shape-spec 
objects and what it means to prove coverage.</p> 
 
<h3>Creating Shape Spec Objects</h3> 
 
<p>Shape spec objects are analogues of <a href="GL____SYMBOLIC-OBJECTS.html">symbolic objects</a>, but with several tweaks that make 
it more straightforward to prove that a given concrete object is covered:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Symbolic objects contain arbitrary Boolean formulas (BDDs or AIGs), whereas 
shape specifiers are restricted to contain only independent Boolean variables. 
Therefore, every bit in a shape specifier is independent from every other 
bit.</li> 
<li>The <span class="v">:g-apply</span> symbolic object construct is replaced by the <span class="v">:g-call</span> 
shape specifier construct.  The <span class="v">:g-call</span> object has an additional field that holds a 
user-provided inverse function, which is useful for proving coverage; see <a href="GL____G-CALL.html">g-call</a>.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Shape spec objects may be created using the following constructors 
 (roughly in order of usefulness).  Additionally, a non-keyword atom is a shape 
spec representing itself:</p> 
 
<dl> 
 
<dt><span class="v">(G-BOOLEAN &lt;num&gt;)</span></dt> 
 
<dd>Represents a Boolean.  <span class="v">num</span> (a natural number) may not be repeated in 
any other <span class="v">:G-BOOLEAN</span> or <span class="v">:G-NUMBER</span> construct in the shape-spec.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">(G-INTEGER &lt;list-of-nums&gt;)</span></dt> 
 
<dd>Represents a two's-complement integer with bits corresponding to the list, 
least significant bit first.  Rationals and complex rationals are also 
available; see <a href="GL____SYMBOLIC-OBJECTS.html">symbolic-objects</a>.  A :G-INTEGER construct with a list of 
length <span class="v">N</span> represents integers <span class="v">X</span> where <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 n))) x)</span> and 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> -1 n)))</span>.  The <span class="v">list-of-nums</span> must be natural numbers, may not 
repeat, and may not occur in any other <span class="v">:G-BOOLEAN</span> or <span class="v">:G-INTEGER</span>/ 
<span class="v">:G-NUMBER</span> construct.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">(G-NUMBER (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> &lt;list-of-nums&gt;))</span></dt> 
<dd>Same as the <span class="v">G-INTEGER</span> form above, for backward compatibility.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> &lt;Car&gt; &lt;Cdr&gt;)</span></dt> 
 
<dd>Represents a cons; Car and Cdr should be well-formed shape specifiers.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">(G-VAR &lt;name&gt;)</span></dt> 
 
<dd>A free variable that may represent any object.  This is primarily useful 
when using GL's term-level capabilities; see <a href="GL____TERM-LEVEL-REASONING.html">term-level-reasoning</a>.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">(<a href="GL____G-CALL.html">G-CALL</a> &lt;fnname&gt; &lt;arglist&gt; &lt;inverse&gt;)</span></dt> 
 
<dd>Represents a call of the named function applied to the given arguments. 
The <span class="v">inverse</span> does not affect the symbolic object generated, which is 
<span class="v">(:G-APPLY &lt;fnname&gt; . &lt;arglist&gt;)</span>, but is used in the coverage proof; see 
<a href="GL____G-CALL.html">g-call</a>. This construct is primarily useful when using GL's term-level 
capabilities; see <a href="GL____TERM-LEVEL-REASONING.html">term-level-reasoning</a>.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">(G-ITE &lt;test&gt; &lt;then&gt; &lt;else&gt;)</span></dt> 
<dd>Represents an if/then/else, where <span class="v">test</span>, <span class="v">then</span>, and <span class="v">else</span> are 
shape specs.</dd> 
 
</dl> 
 
 
<h3>What is a Coverage Proof?</h3> 
 
<p>In order to prove a theorem by symbolic simulation, one binds each variable 
mentioned in the theorem to a symbolic object and then symbolically simulates 
the conclusion of the theorem on these symbolic objects.  If the result is 
true, what can we conclude?  It depends on the coverage of the symbolic inputs. 
For example, one might symbolically simulate the term <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> A B) 7)</span> with 
<span class="v">A</span> and <span class="v">B</span> bound to symbolic objects representing two-bit natural 
numbers and recieve a result of <span class="v">T</span>.  From this, it would be fallacious to 
conclude <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 6 8) 7)</span>, because the symbolic simulation didn't cover the 
case where <span class="v">A</span> was 6 and <span class="v">B</span> 7.  In fact, it isn't certain that we can 
conclude <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 2 2) 7)</span> from our symbolic simulation, because the symbolic 
object bindings for <span class="v">A</span> and <span class="v">B</span> might have interedependencies such that 
<span class="v">A</span> and <span class="v">B</span> can't simultaneously represent 2.  (For example, the bindings 
could be such that bit 0 of <span class="v">A</span> and <span class="v">B</span> are always opposite.)  In order 
to prove a useful theorem from the result of such a symbolic simulation, we 
must show that some set of concrete input vectors is covered by the symbolic 
objects bound to <span class="v">A</span> and <span class="v">B</span>.  But in general, it is a tough 
computational problem to determine the set of concrete input vectors that are 
covered by a given symbolic input vector.</p> 
 
<p>To make these determinations easier, shape spec objects are somewhat 
restricted.  Whereas symbolic objects generally use BDDs (or AIGs, depending on 
the <a href="GL____MODES.html">mode</a>) to represent 
individual Booleans or bits of numeric values (see <a href="GL____SYMBOLIC-OBJECTS.html">symbolic-objects</a>), 
shape specs instead use natural numbers representing Boolean variables. 
Additionally, shape specs are restricted such that no Boolean variable number may 
be used more than once among the bindings for the variables of a theorem; this 
prevents interdependencies among them.</p> 
 
<p>While in general it is a difficult problem to determine whether a symbolic 
object can evaluate to a given concrete object, a function 
<span class="v">SHAPE-SPEC-OBJ-IN-RANGE</span> can make that determination about shape specs. 
<span class="v">SHAPE-SPEC-OBJ-IN-RANGE</span> takes two arguments, a shape spec and some object, 
and returns T if that object is in the coverage set of the shape spec, and NIL 
otherwise.  Therefore, if we wish to conclude that shape specs bound to <span class="v">A</span> 
and <span class="v">B</span> cover all two-bit natural numbers, we may prove the following 
theorem:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> a) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> a 4)
              (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> b) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> b 4))
         (shape-spec-obj-in-range (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a-binding b-binding)
                                  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a b)))</pre> 
 
<p>When proving a theorem using the GL clause processor, variable bindings are 
given as shape specs so that coverage obligations may be stated in terms of 
<span class="v">SHAPE-SPEC-OBJ-IN-RANGE</span>.  The shape specs are converted to symbolic 
objects and may be parametrized based on some restrictions from the hypotheses, 
restricting their range further.  Thus, in order to prove a theorem about 
fixed-length natural numbers, for example, one may provide a shape specifier 
that additionally covers negative integers of the given length; parametrization 
can then restrict the symbolic inputs used in the simulation to only cover the 
naturals, while the coverage proof may still be done using the simpler, 
unparametrized shape spec.</p>
