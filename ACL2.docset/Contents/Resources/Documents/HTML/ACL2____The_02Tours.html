<p>The Tours</p><p>ACL2 is a very large, multipurpose system.  You can use it as a 
 programming language, a specification language, a modeling language, a formal 
 mathematical logic, or a semi-automatic theorem prover, just to name its most 
 common uses.  It has been used on a number of <a href="ACL2____INTERESTING-APPLICATIONS.html">industrial applications</a>.  If you're uncertain 
 as to whether your project is appropriate for ACL2 we urge you to look over 
 this list or contact the ACL2 developers.</p> 
 
 <p>This home page includes all of ACL2's online documentation, which is quite 
 extensive (over 4 megabytes).  To help ease your introduction to ACL2, we have 
 built two tours through this documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>If you are familiar with at least some of the <a href="ACL2____INTERESTING-APPLICATIONS.html">industrial applications</a> of ACL2, then you 
 will understand the distance between the simple examples we talk about in 
 these tours and the kinds of things ACL2 users do with the system.</p> 
 
 <p>Newcomers to ACL2 should first take the ``Flying Tour.''  Then, if you want 
 to know more, take the ``Walking Tour.''  On your first reading, follow the 
 two Tours linearly, clicking only on the icon of the Tour you're on.  Beware 
 of other links, which might jump you from one tour to the other or into the 
 ACL2 User's Manual!  Once you've had a coherent overview of the system, you 
 might quickly repeat both Tours to see if there are unvisited links you're 
 interested in, using your browser's Back Button to return to your starting 
 points.</p> 
 
 <p>If after all this you want to learn how to use the theorem prover (!), see 
 <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>To start a tour, click on the appropriate icon below.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____A_02Flying_02Tour_02of_02ACL2.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/flying.gif"></div></a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Walking_02Tour_02of_02ACL2.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/walking.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>If you take the tours in a text-based format (such as using the :DOC 
 command in Emacs), they will probably be unsatisfying because we use gif files 
 and assume you can navigate ``back.''</p>
