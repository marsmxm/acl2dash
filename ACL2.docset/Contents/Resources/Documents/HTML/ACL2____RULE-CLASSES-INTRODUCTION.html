<p>Selecting which kind of rule to create</p><p>Successful ACL2 users generally direct many of their proved 
 theorems to be stored as rules, which can be applied automatically in 
 subsequent proof attempts.  See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a detailed discussion 
 of the kinds of rules that can be created.  Here, we give a brief introduction 
 to rule-classes that may suffice for most ACL2 users.</p> 
 
 <p>The workhorse for ACL2 proof attempts is generally the application of <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules.  When you prove a theorem stated with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, ACL2 
 stores it as a rewrite rule unless either the <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> keyword is 
 supplied explicitly or an error occurs because the theorem is not in a form 
 that ACL2 knows how to store as a rewrite rule.  See <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> for an 
 introduction to rewrite rules in ACL2.  That topic also has links to useful 
 introductory material as well as a notion of <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a>, which allows 
 the rewriting of one term to another when the two are merely equivalent in 
 some suitable sense, but not necessarily equal.</p> 
 
 <p>Most successful ACL2 users make only sparing use of other kinds of rules 
 besides rewrite rules.  When in doubt, the default is probably best: the 
 absence of any <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> keyword in a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event, which 
 is equivalent to <span class="v">:rule-classes :rewrite</span>.  Below are some suggestions for 
 when other kinds of rules might be appropriate.  Of course, you are welcome to 
 scan the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> for examples.  One can for example find many 
 examples (apparently more than 15,000) of <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rules by 
 standing in the <span class="v">books/</span> directory and issuing the following shell 
 command (Linux or MacOS):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">time egrep -e ':rule-classes .*type-prescription' --include='*.l*sp' -ri .</pre> 
 
 <p>Below, we sometimes speak of the ``conclusion'' of a formula.  For many 
 rule classes, this is simply the formula itself unless the formula is of the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> hyp concl)</span>, in which case it is recursively the conclusion 
 of <span class="v">concl</span>.  See the subtopics of <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for detailed 
 documentation.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>If the conclusion is a call of a primitive recognizer or a compound 
 recognizer, or the negation of such — for example, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> (f x
 y))</span> — consider making a <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rule.  (For relevant 
 background on recognizers, see <a href="ACL2____COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a>, which also 
 describes how to make a rule that designates a function as a 
 compound-recognizer.)  But note that hypotheses of such a rule are 
 proved (``relieved'') by ACL2 only using <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> reasoning.  If you 
 want rewriting to be used for relieving the hypotheses, you can wrap them in 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a></span>.</li> 
 
 <li>If the conclusion is an inequality or negated inequality, consider making 
 a <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> rule, but generally only if you can identify a reasonable 
 maximal term, which very roughly is a syntactially largest term that binds all 
 the variables.  For example, the formula <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> (f x y) (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> y z))</span> might not 
 make a good linear rule.  For a more careful discussion of maximal terms, see 
 <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>If the formula is a term in normal form (not simplifiable by your rewrite 
 rules) that tends to be an explicit hypothesis in some of your theorems, 
 consider making it a <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rule.  For example, if you are 
 reasoning about a finite state machine (such as an interpreter) and your 
 theorems tend to have the hypothesis <span class="v">(good-state-p st)</span>, and your formula 
 is <span class="v">(good-state-p (foo st))</span>, then that formula is a good candidate for a 
 <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rule.</li> 
 
 <li>If the rule looks like a recursive definition <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f x1 x2 ..)
 (... (f ...) ...))</span>, consider making a <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> rule.</li> 
 
 <li>When you want to control the simplifier rather than just turning rules 
 (especially rewrite rules) loose on your terms, consider using <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> 
 rules or <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a> rules.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>There are other rule classes that can be useful.  See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> 
 for a complete list.</p>
