 <p>This doc topic discusses the rule-class <span class="v">:rewrite</span>.  If you want a 
 general discussion of how rewriting works in ACL2 and some guidance on how to 
 construct effective rewrite rules, see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-REWRITE-RULES-PART-1.html">introduction-to-rewrite-rules-part-1</a> and then see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-REWRITE-RULES-PART-2.html">introduction-to-rewrite-rules-part-2</a>.  If you want a flexible, convenient 
 interface to the ACL2 rewriter that can be called programmatically, see <a href="ACL2____REWRITE_42.html">rewrite$</a>.</p>

 <p>Note: One <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule class object might create many rewrite rules 
 from the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> formula.  To create the rules, we first 
 translate the formula, expanding all macros (see <a href="ACL2____TRANS.html">trans</a>) and also 
 removing <a href="ACL2____GUARD-HOLDERS.html">guard-holders</a>.  Next, we then flatten the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a></span> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> structure of the formula; for example, if the hypothesis or 
 conclusion is of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> term1 term2) term3)</span>, then we replace 
 that by the ``flat'' term <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> term1 term2 term3)</span>.  (The latter is 
 actually an abbreviation for the right-associated term <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> term1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a>
 term2 term3))</span>.)  During this flattening process, we eliminate <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span>s as necessary in order to continue flattening; one may think of this 
 step as simply substituting to eliminate <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> in order to expose more calls of <span class="v">implies</span> and <span class="v">and</span>.  The 
 result is a conjunction of formulas, each of the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> h1 ... hn) concl)</pre> 
 
 <p>where no hypothesis is a conjunction and <span class="v">concl</span> is neither a 
 conjunction nor an implication.  If necessary, the hypothesis of such a 
 conjunct may be vacuous.  We then further coerce each <span class="v">concl</span> into the form 
 <span class="v">(equiv lhs rhs)</span>, where we continue to eliminate <span class="v">lambdas</span> until we 
 reach this form, and then we eliminate <span class="v">lambdas</span> from the first argument of 
 <span class="v">equiv</span> but not the second argument.  Here <span class="v">equiv</span> is a known <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation.  If we do not reach an equivalence relation, even after 
 eliminating <span class="v">lamdas</span>, then we replace the resulting term, <span class="v">term</span> by 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> term t)</span>, except that we replace <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> term)</span> by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> term
 nil)</span>.  By these steps we reduce the given <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a></span> to a 
 sequence of conjuncts, each of which is of the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> h1 ... hn)
         (equiv lhs rhs))</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">equiv</span> is a known <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation and <span class="v">lhs</span> has no 
 <span class="v">lambda</span>s.  See <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> for a general discussion of the 
 introduction of new <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relations.  At this point, we check 
 whether <span class="v">lhs</span> and <span class="v">rhs</span> are the same term; if so, we cause an error, 
 since this rule will loop.  (But this is just a basic check; the rule could 
 loop in other cases, for example if <span class="v">rhs</span> is an instance of <span class="v">lhs</span>; see 
 <a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p>You can experiment by creating some rewrite rules using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> and 
 then using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span> to see how the rule was stored.</p> 
 
 <p>We create a <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule for each such conjunct, if possible, and 
 otherwise cause an error.  It is possible to create a rewrite rule from such a 
 conjunct provided <span class="v">lhs</span> is not a variable, a quoted constant, a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>-expression, or a <span class="v">lambda</span> application.  Although it is legal to create 
 a rewrite rule from an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>-expression <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> tst tbr fbr)</span>, note that 
 the rewriter uses the truth or falsity of the test, <span class="v">tst</span>, when rewriting 
 the true and false branches <span class="v">tbr</span> and <span class="v">fbr</span>, respectively; so rewrite 
 rules are most often unnecessary for <span class="v">if</span>-expressions.</p> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule is used when any instance of the <span class="v">lhs</span> occurs in a 
 context in which the <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation is an admissible <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> relation.  First, we find a substitution that makes <span class="v">lhs</span> equal 
 to the target term.  Then we attempt to relieve the instantiated hypotheses of 
 the rule.  Hypotheses that are fully instantiated are relieved by recursive 
 rewriting.  Hypotheses that contain ``free variables'' (variables not assigned 
 by the unifying substitution) are relieved by attempting to guess a suitable 
 instance so as to make the hypothesis equal to some known assumption in the 
 context of the target.  If the hypotheses are relieved, and certain 
 restrictions that prevent some forms of infinite regress are met (see <a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a>), the target is replaced by the instantiated <span class="v">rhs</span>, which is 
 then recursively rewritten.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2's rewriting process has some optimizations, including the 
 following.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The suggestion, above, that the rewriter looks through the goal clause for 
 ``any instance of the <span class="v">lhs</span>'' is not quite true.  <span class="v">:Rewrite</span> rules are 
 never applied to quoted constants or any term inside a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a></span>. 
 If you want to rewrite a quoted constant use a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE-QUOTED-CONSTANT.html">rewrite-quoted-constant</a></span> rule.</li> 
 
 <li>The notion of ``a substitution that makes <span class="v">lhs</span> equal to the target 
 term'' is a bit more generous than the most straightforward such notion. 
 Suppose for example that <span class="v">lhs</span> is <span class="v">(f (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 3 x))</span> and the target term is 
 <span class="v">(f (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 3 (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> y))</span>.  (Aside: ACL2 deals in so-called translated terms, so 
 since <span class="v">+</span> is a macro, <span class="v">lhs</span> and term would actually be <span class="v">(f (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a>
 '3 x))</span> and <span class="v">(f (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a> '3 (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> y)))</span>; we will ignore this distinction, 
 but if you want more information, see <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>.)  Then of course, that 
 substitution binds <span class="v">x</span> to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> y)</span>.  But now suppose that instead the 
 target term is <span class="v">(f 10)</span>.  You may be surprised to learn that the 
 substitution binding <span class="v">x</span> to <span class="v">7</span> makes <span class="v">(f (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 3 x))</span> equal to <span class="v">(f
 10)</span>; for example, the rewrite rule <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x 3)) (h x)))</span> would 
 rewrite <span class="v">(f 10)</span> to <span class="v">(h 7)</span>.  This would also be the case if <span class="v">lhs</span> 
 were instead <span class="v">(f (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x 3))</span>.  This sort of optimization occurs when the new 
 constant has <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a></span> no greater than the old constant.  There are 
 similar optimizations for <span class="v">*</span>, <span class="v">/</span>, <span class="v">-</span>, strings, symbols, and 
 conses (for details see ACL2 source function 
 <span class="v">one-way-unify1-quotep-subproblems</span>).</li> 
 
 <li>When a term <span class="v">t1</span> is rewritten to a new term <span class="v">t2</span>, the rewriter is 
 then immediately applied to <span class="v">t2</span>.  On rare occasions you may find that you 
 do not want this behavior, in which case you may wish to use a trick involving 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a></span>; see <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>, near the end of that documentation.</li> 
 
 <li>When the hypotheses and right-hand side are rewritten, ACL2 does not 
 really first apply the substitution and then rewrite; instead, as it 
 rewrites those terms it looks up the <i>already rewritten</i> values of the 
 bound variables.  Sometimes you may want those bindings rewritten again, e.g., 
 because the variables occur in slots that admit additional equivalence 
 relations.  See <a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a>.</li>
