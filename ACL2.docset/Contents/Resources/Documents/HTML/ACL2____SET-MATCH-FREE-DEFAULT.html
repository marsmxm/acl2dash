<p>Provide default for <span class="v">:match-free</span> in future rules</p><pre class="code">General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-DEFAULT.html">set-match-free-default</a> :once)
(<a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-DEFAULT.html">set-match-free-default</a> :all)

 <p>Note: This utility does not apply to <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules; for a 
 related topic pertinent to such rules, see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES-TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">free-variables-type-prescription</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>As described elsewhere (see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>), a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, or <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rule may have free variables in its 
 hypotheses, and ACL2 can be directed either to try all bindings 
 (``<span class="v">:all</span>'') or just the first (``<span class="v">:once</span>'') when relieving that 
 hypothesis, as a basis for relieving subsequent hypotheses.  This directing of 
 <span class="v">:all</span> or <span class="v">:once</span> is generally provided by specifying either 
 <span class="v">:match-free :once</span> or <span class="v">:match-free :all</span> in the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> of the rule.  If neither of these is specified, then the most 
 recent <span class="v">set-match-free-default</span> is used by ACL2 to fill in this missing 
 <span class="v">:match-free</span> field.  See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.  Except: If the last 
 <span class="v">set-match-free-default</span> specifies <span class="v">nil</span>, then ACL2 reverts to the 
 behavior it had at start-up, as described in Remarks (2) and (3) below.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> 
 but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded.  It 
 uses the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, and hence its effect is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to 
 the book or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form in which it occurs.</p> 
 
 <p>Remarks.</p> 
 
 <p>(1) The use of <span class="v">set-match-free-default</span> has no effect on existing rules. 
 In order to change the behavior of existing rules with respect to 
 free-variable matching, see <a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) If you submit a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, or <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rule with a free variable in a hypothesis, and no default 
 setting was previously specified with <span class="v">set-match-free-default</span> or the 
 default setting is <span class="v">nil</span>, and the rule is not within a book being processed 
 with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REBUILD.html">rebuild</a></span>, then a 
 warning or error is caused.  In order to make this an error instead of a 
 warning, see <a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-ERROR.html">set-match-free-error</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(3) If you submit a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, or <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rule with a free variable in a hypothesis, and no default 
 setting has been previously specified with <span class="v">set-match-free-default</span> or the 
 default setting is <span class="v">nil</span>, and no error is caused (see (2) above), then the 
 default <span class="v">:all</span> is used.</p>
