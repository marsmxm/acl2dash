<p>An abstraction of the <b>B</b>oolean <b>F</b>unction 
<b>R</b>epresentation used by GL.</p><p>GL was originally designed to operate on <a href="ACL2____UBDDS.html">ubdds</a>, with 
support for <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">aig</a>s being added later.  To avoid redoing a lot of proof 
work, a small level of indirection was added.</p> 
 
<p>The particular Boolean function representation that we are using at any 
particular time is governed by <a href="GL____BFR-MODE.html">bfr-mode</a>, and operations like <a href="ACL2____BFR-AND.html">bfr-and</a> allow us to construct new function nodes using whatever the current 
representation is.</p>
