<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____DEFTHM-DOMAIN">Click for Defthm-domain in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Prove termination on a given domain</p><p>This utility can be useful after executing a call of <span class="v">defpm</span>; 
 see <a href="ACL2____DEF-PARTIAL-MEASURE.html">def-partial-measure</a>.  Indeed, we assume that you have read the 
 example in that <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic describing this call:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFPM.html">defpm</a> fact-test fact-step
  fact-measure fact-terminates fact-theory)</pre> 
 
 <h3>Introduction By Way of an Example</h3> 
 
 <p>Consider the following form.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM-DOMAIN.html">defthm-domain</a> trfact-terminates-holds-on-natp
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> x)
           (trfact-terminates x acc))
  :test trfact-test ; optional test name: can be deduced by the tool ;
  :step trfact-step ; optional step name: can be deduced by the tool ;
  :measure (<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> x) ; required argument ;
  )</pre> 
 
 <p>This call produces a proof of the indicated formula, where the first 
 argument of <span class="v">implies</span>, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> x)</span>, provides a ``domain hypothesis.'' 
 You can use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS1.html">trans1</a></span> to see the macroexpansion of this 
 <span class="v">defthm-domain</span> call.  In short, <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> are supplied to automate all 
 ``boilerplate'' reasoning.  The <span class="v">:measure</span> is used to guide a proof by 
 induction.  At this stage of development, the best way to use this macro is 
 probably to submit the form in the hope that the proof will complete 
 automatically; but if it doesn't, then use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS1.html">trans1</a></span> to see what 
 the form generates, and modify that event manually in order to fix the failed 
 proofs.</p> 
 
 <h3>Detailed Documentation</h3> 
 
 <p>General form:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM-DOMAIN.html">defthm-domain</a> NAME
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> DOMAIN-TERM
           (TERMINATES FORMAL-1 ... FORMAL-K))
  :test TEST
  :step STEP
  :measure MEASURE
  :verbose VERBOSE
  :root ROOT
  )</pre> 
 
 <p>where there is no output unless <span class="v">VERBOSE</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  It is 
 allowed to replace the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> call above by its second argument (the 
 <span class="v">TERMINATES</span> call) if <span class="v">DOMAIN-TERM</span> is <span class="v">t</span>.  The remaining arguments 
 are as follows.</p> 
 
 <p>The keywords <span class="v">:test</span> and <span class="v">:step</span> both have value <span class="v">nil</span> by default. 
 So does <span class="v">:root</span>, unless <span class="v">TERMINATES</span> has a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> of the 
 form <span class="v">"root-TERMINATES"</span>, in which case :root is the symbol in the 
 package of <span class="v">TERMINATES</span> whose name is that string, <span class="v">root</span>.  If 
 <span class="v">:root</span> has a value of <span class="v">nil</span>, even after taking this default into 
 account, then both <span class="v">:test</span> and <span class="v">:step</span> must have a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value. 
 The reason for this requirement is that when <span class="v">:test</span> and/or <span class="v">:step</span> is 
 omitted, the value is computed from the root by adding the suffix 
 <span class="v">"-TEST"</span> or <span class="v">"-STEP"</span> to the root (respectively).  The functions 
 introduced for <span class="v">:test</span> and <span class="v">:step</span> are exactly as for <span class="v">defpm</span>; see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEF-PARTIAL-MEASURE.html">def-partial-measure</a>.  Note however that the formals are those from the 
 call of <span class="v">TERMINATES</span>.</p>

 to deal with failures of <span class="v">defthm-domain</span> calls.</p> 
 
 <h3>More Information</h3> 
 
 <p>The community book <span class="v">misc/defpm.lisp</span> illustrates how to use <span class="v">defpm</span> 
 and <span class="v">defthm-domain</span> to define ``partial'' functions.  Search for calls of 
 <span class="v">my-test</span> in that book to see examples.</p>
