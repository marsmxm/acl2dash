<p>Table-based alternative to ACL2's named theories.</p><p>Rulesets are like <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>, but can be extended with 
additional rules after first being defined.  That is, you can build up a 
ruleset incrementally, across many books, instead of having to define it all at 
once and having it be forever fixed.</p> 
 
<p>Basic usage of rulesets is just like theories.  You can:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Introduce rulesets with <a href="ACL2____DEF-RULESET.html">def-ruleset</a>
</li> 
<li>Extend existing rulesets with <a href="ACL2____ADD-TO-RULESET.html">add-to-ruleset</a>.</li> 
<li>Enable/disable rulesets with <a href="ACL2____ENABLE_A2.html">enable*</a>, <a href="ACL2____DISABLE_A2.html">disable*</a>, and <a href="ACL2____E_F2D_A2.html">e/d*</a>
</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>When we define a new package <span class="v">FOO</span>, we often set up <span class="v">FOO::enable</span> as 
an alias for <span class="v">enable*</span>, to make using rulesets more convenient.</p> 
 
<p>Advanced users can do some nifty things with rulesets, e.g., you can have a 
superior ruleset that contains other rulesets, and it will grow as you add 
rules to the contained rulesets.</p> 
 
<p>A ruleset is actually a list of so-called <i>ruleset designators</i>.  All 
ruleset operators, such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____E_F2D_A2.html">e/d*</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEF-RULESET.html">def-ruleset</a></span>, take arguments 
that are rulesets.  See <a href="ACL2____EXPAND-RULESET.html">expand-ruleset</a> for a discussion of ruleset 
designators and the corresponding <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a> that they represent.</p>
