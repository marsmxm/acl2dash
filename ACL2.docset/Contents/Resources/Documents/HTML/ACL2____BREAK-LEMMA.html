<p>A quick introduction to breaking rewrite rules in ACL2</p><pre class="code">Example:
:brr t                          ; if you haven't done that yet
:monitor (:rewrite lemma12) t   ; to install a break point on the
                                ;   rule named (:rewrite lemma12)
:monitor! (:rewrite lemma12) t  ; quiet version of :monitor that
                                ;   invokes :brr t</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 does not support Nqthm's <span class="v">break-lemma</span> but supports a very similar 
 and more powerful break facility.  Suppose some proof is failing; apparently 
 some particular rule is not being used and you wish to learn why.  Then you 
 need the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> facility.  See <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> and all 
 of its associated <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> topics for details.  The following basic 
 steps are required.</p> 
 
 <p>(1) To enable the ``break rewrite'' feature, you must first execute</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:brr t</pre> 
 
 <p>at the top-level of ACL2.  Equivalently, evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a> t)</span>.  <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">Break-rewrite</a> stays enabled until you disable it with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a> nil)</span>.  When 
 <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> is enabled the ACL2 rewriter will run slower than normal 
 but you will be able to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> the attempts to apply specified 
 rules.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) Decide what <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s (see <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>) you wish to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>. 
 For example, you might want to know why <span class="v">(:rewrite lemma12 . 2)</span> is not 
 being used in the attempted proof.  That, by the way, is the name of the 
 second rewrite rule generated from the event named <span class="v">lemma12</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The command</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:monitor (:rewrite lemma12 . 2) t</pre> 
 
 <p>will install an ``unconditional'' break point on that rule.  The ``<span class="v">t</span>'' 
 at the end of the command means it is unconditional, i.e., a break will occur 
 every time the rule is tried.  ACL2 supports conditional breaks also, in which 
 case the <span class="v">t</span> is replaced by an expression that evaluates to non-<span class="v">nil</span> 
 when you wish for a break to occur.  See <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>.  The above keyword 
 command is, of course, equivalent to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> '(:rewrite lemma12 . 2) t)</pre> 
 
 <p>which you may also type.  You may install breaks on as many rules as you 
 wish.  You must use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a></span> on each rule.  You may also change the 
 break condition on a rule with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a></span>.  Use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a></span> (see 
 <a href="ACL2____UNMONITOR.html">unmonitor</a>) to remove a rule from the list of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed 
 rules.</p> 
 
 <p>(3) Then try the proof again.  When a <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rule is tried by the 
 rewriter you will enter an interactive break, called <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>. 
 See <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> for a detailed description.  Very simply, <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> lets you inspect the context of the attempted application both 
 before and after the attempt.  When <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> is entered it will 
 print out the ``target'' term being rewritten.  If you type <span class="v">:go</span> <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> will try the rule and then exit, telling you (a) whether the 
 rule was applied, (b) if so, how the target was rewritten, and (c) if not, why 
 the rule failed.  There are many other commands.  See <a href="ACL2____BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(4) When you have finished using the <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> feature you 
 should disable it to speed up the rewriter.  You can disable it with</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:brr nil</pre> 
 
 <p>The list of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules and their break conditions persists but 
 is ignored.  If you enable <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> later, the list of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules will be displayed and will be used again by rewrite.</p> 
 
 <p>You should disable the <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> feature whenever you are not 
 intending to use it, even if the list of <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed rules is empty, 
 because the rewriter is slowed down as long as <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> is 
 enabled.</p>
