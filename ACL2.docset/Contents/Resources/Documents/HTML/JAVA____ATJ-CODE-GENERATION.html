<p>Code generation performed by ATJ.</p><p>We generate Java abstract syntax, 
     which we then pretty-print to files.</p><p>We translate ACL2 values, terms, and lambda expressions 
     to Java expressions ``preceded by'' Java blocks. 
     By this we mean that the relevant code generation functions 
     generally return a Java block and a Java expression, 
     such that the block must be executed before the expression. 
     That is, the Java block provides the necessary code 
     to ``prepare'' the evaluation of the Java expression. 
     The Java block may include Java expressions and blocks 
     that are recursively generated.</p><p>To illustrate this concept, 
     consider the generation of a Java expression to build 
     the Java representation of an ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span> pair. 
     In some circumstances, 
     since the pair may be a large binary tree, 
     we prefer not to generate a large Java expression. 
     Instead, we generate 
     a Java block that sets a local variable to the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>, 
     a Java block that sets another local variable to the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span>, 
     and then a Java expression that builds the pair 
     from those two variables. 
     The two blocks are concatenated, 
     resulting in a block and an expression 
     for the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span> pair in question. 
     But the expressions assigned to the two local variables 
     may in turn need to be built that way, recursively. 
     This recursion ends when an atom value is reached. 
     A similar strategy is used to build 
     Java representations of ACL2 terms and lambda expressions, 
     which have a recursive structure analogously to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span> pairs.</p><p>As special cases, some of these code generation functions 
     may return just Java expressions and no blocks, 
     since they would always return empty blocks.</p><p>These code generation functions keep track 
     of the next local variables to use 
     via numeric indices that are threaded through the functions. 
     The indices are appended to the base names for the local variables 
     in order to guarantee the uniqueness of the local variables.</p><p>The <span class="v">atj-gen-deep-...</span> functions are used 
     for the deep embedding approach. 
     The <span class="v">atj-gen-shallow-...</span> functions are used 
     for the shallow embedding approach. 
     The other functions are generally used for both approaches.</p><p>The code generation process consists of <a href="JAVA____ATJ-PRE-TRANSLATION.html">a pre-translation from ACL2 to ACL2</a>, followed by a translation from ACL2 to Java, 
     followed by <a href="JAVA____ATJ-POST-TRANSLATION.html">a post-translation from Java to Java</a>. The pre-translation turns the ACL2 code into a form 
     that is closer to the target Java code, 
     thus making the translation simpler. 
     The correctness of the pre-translation can be formally proved within ACL2, 
     without involving (the semantics of) Java. 
     The post-translation makes some improvements directly on the Java code.</p>
