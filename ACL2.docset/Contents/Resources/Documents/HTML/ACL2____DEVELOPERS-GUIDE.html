<p>Guide for ACL2 developers</p><p>This guide is <b>NOT</b> intended for the full ACL2 user community. 
 Rather, it is intended for <i>experienced</i> ACL2 users who may wish to 
 become ACL2 <i>developers</i>, that is, to contribute to the maintenance and 
 enhancement of the ACL2 source code.  Don't waste your time here unless you're 
 an ACL2 developer, or intending to become one!</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 is maintained solely by Matt Kaufmann and J Moore, although for some 
 time they have occasionally vetted code written by others, ultimately 
 incorporating it into the system.  Although this is anticipated to remain the 
 case for some time, a process is underway towards gradually turning 
 maintenance over to some other small group of trusted, reliable, responsible 
 people.  This guide was motivated by the desire to begin to support the 
 eventual development of such a group.</p> 
 
 <p>(Of course, given the permissive license of ACL2, anyone is allowed to 
 modify a copy of its source code.  Here we are talking about what is generally 
 called ``ACL2'', which is distributed from github and from the University of 
 Texas at Austin.)</p> 
 
 <p>The first step towards contributing to ACL2 development is to join the 
 <span class="v">acl2-devel</span> mailing list by <a href="mailto:kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu" target="_blank"><nobr>emailing Matt Kaufmann<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to mailto:kaufmann@cs.utexas.edu"></nobr></a> with a request 
 to be added.</p> 
 
 <p>The website for the (first) Developer's Workshop has quite a bit of useful 
 information.  It is at: <pre class="code"><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-devel-2017/" target="_blank"><nobr>http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-devel-2017/<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-devel-2017/"></nobr></a></pre></p> 
 
 <p>Note that for the second Developer's Workshop, some colors were added to 
 this Guide to help guide the discussion.  (Colors show up in the web version 
 but not in the <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> browser.)  This <font color="#c00000">red 
 color</font> highlights passages that were to be given some emphasis.  Also, 
 in some cases there is a note of the following form, for use in the 
 workshop:</p> 
 
 <font color="#800080"><p>[...SOME NOTE FOR THE WORKSHOP...]</p></font> 
 
 <font color="#c00000"> 
 <p>For a small list of potential ACL2 development tasks, see community books 
 file <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/blob/master/books/system/to-do.txt" target="_blank"><nobr>books/system/to-do.txt<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/blob/master/books/system/to-do.txt"></nobr></a>. 
 If you decide to work on one of these tasks, please make a note (just below 
 the one-line header at the top of the tasks's item) saying that you are doing 
 so.  Before you start, ask Matt Kaufmann to commit to incorporating your 
 changes; without a commitment from Matt, he reserves the right not to consider 
 doing so.</p> </font> 
 
 <p>The subtopics listed below are sometimes referred to as ``chapters'' of 
 this (Developer's) Guide.  They can be read in any order, but on a first read, 
 you may find it helpful to read them in the order in which they appear 
 below.</p>
