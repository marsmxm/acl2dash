<p>About the Admission of Recursive Definitions</p><p>You can't just add any formula as an axiom or definition and expect 
 the logic to stay sound!  For example, if we were permitted to define <span class="v">(APP
 X Y)</span> so that it was equal to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (APP X Y))</span> then we could prove 
 anything.  The purported ``definition'' of <span class="v">APP</span> must have several 
 properties to be admitted to the logic as a new axiom.</p> 
 
 <p>The key property a recursive definition must have is that the recursion 
 terminate.  This, along with some syntactic criteria, ensures us that there 
 exists a function satisfying the definition.</p> 
 
 <p>Termination must be proved before the definition is admitted.  This is done 
 in general by finding a measure of the arguments of the function and a 
 well-founded relation such that the arguments ``get smaller'' every time a 
 recursive branch is taken.</p> 
 
 <p>For <span class="v">app</span> the measure is the ``size'' of the first argument, <span class="v">x</span>, as 
 determined by the primitive function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>. 
 The well-founded relation used in this example is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O-P.html">o-p</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>, 
 which is the standard ordering on the ordinals less than ``epsilon naught.'' 
 These particular choices for <span class="v">app</span> were made ``automatically'' by ACL2. 
 But they are in fact determined by various ``default'' settings.  The user of 
 ACL2 can change the defaults or specify a ``hint'' to the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 command to specify the measure and relation.</p>
