<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____ARRAY1">Click for Array1 in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A book of lemmas that characterize 1-dimensional arrays.</p><p>Because many of the functions characterized by this book are 
non-recursive, one should always <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> the theory 
<span class="v">ARRAY1-FUNCTIONS</span> after including this book, or the lemmas will not be 
applicable.</p> 
 
<p>The lemmas exported by this book should completely characterize 
1-dimensional arrays for most purposes.  Given the lemmas exported by this 
book, it should not be necessary to <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> any of the 1-dimensional 
array functions except under special circumstances.</p> 
 
<p>This book defines a function <a href="ACL2____RESET-ARRAY1.html">reset-array1</a> that clears an array, 
effectively resetting each element of the array to the default value.  This 
book also includes a macro, <a href="ACL2____DEFARRAY1TYPE.html">defarray1type</a>, which defines recognizers and 
supporting lemmas for 1-dimensional arrays whose elements are all of a fixed 
type.</p>
