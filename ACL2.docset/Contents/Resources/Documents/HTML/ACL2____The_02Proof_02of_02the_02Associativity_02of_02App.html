<p>The Proof of the Associativity of App</p><p><a href="ACL2____Overview_02of_02the_02Simplification_02of_02the_02Induction_02Step_02to_02T.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/walking.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>Here is the theorem prover's output when it processes the <b>defthm</b> 
 command for the associativity of <span class="v">app</span>.  We have highlighted text for which 
 we offer some explanation, and broken the presentation into several pages. 
 (The most recent version of ACL2 may print slightly different output but the 
 basics are the same.)  Just follow the Walking Tour after exploring the 
 explanations.</p> 
 
 <p>However, before exploring this output you should understand that ACL2 users 
 rarely read successful proofs!  Instead, they look at certain subgoals printed 
 in failed proofs, figure whether and how those subgoals can be proved, and 
 give ACL2 directions for proving them, usually by simply proving other lemmas. 
 Furthermore, to be a good user of ACL2 you do not have to understand how the 
 theorem prover works.  You just have to understand how to interact with it. 
 We explain this in great detail later.  But basically all new users are 
 curious to know how ACL2 works and this little tour attempts to give some 
 answers, just to satisfy your curiosity.  The first command below, 
 <span class="v">:set-gag-mode nil</span>, instructs ACL2 to supply its full prover output; 
 normally that output is restricted considerably (``gagged''), but we include 
 it all below in support of the associated explanations.</p>

Name the formula above <a href="ACL2____Name_02the_02Formula_02Above.html">*1</a>. 
 
<a href="ACL2____Perhaps.html">Perhaps</a> we can prove *1 by induction.  Three induction schemes are 
<a href="ACL2____Suggested_02Inductions_02in_02the_02Associativity_02of_02App_02Example.html">suggested</a> by this conjecture.  <a href="ACL2____Subsumption_02of_02Induction_02Candidates_02in_02App_02Example.html">Subsumption</a> reduces that number to two. 
However, one of these is <a href="ACL2____Flawed_02Induction_02Candidates_02in_02App_02Example.html">flawed</a> and so we are left with one viable 
candidate. 
 
We will induct according to a scheme suggested by (APP A B).  If we 
let  (:P A B C) denote *1 above then the induction scheme we'll use 
is 
<a href="ACL2____The_02Induction_02Scheme_02Selected_02for_02the_02App_02Example.html">(</a>AND 
   <a href="ACL2____The_02Induction_02Step_02in_02the_02App_02Example.html">(</a>IMPLIES (AND (NOT (ENDP A)) 
                 (:P (CDR A) B C)) 
            (:P A B C)) 
   <a href="ACL2____The_02Base_02Case_02in_02the_02App_02Example.html">(</a>IMPLIES (ENDP A) (:P A B C))). 
This induction is <a href="ACL2____The_02Justification_02of_02the_02Induction_02Scheme.html">justified</a> by the same argument used to admit APP, 
namely, the measure (ACL2-COUNT A) is decreasing according to the relation 
O&lt; (which is known to be well-founded on the domain recognized 
by O-P).  When <a href="ACL2____The_02Instantiation_02of_02the_02Induction_02Scheme.html">applied</a> to the goal at hand the above induction 
scheme produces the following two <a href="ACL2____Nontautological_02Subgoals.html">nontautological subgoals</a>.
