<p>ACL2(r) recognizer for standard objects</p><p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____STANDARDP.html">Standardp</a> x)</span> is true if and only if <span class="v">x</span> is a ``standard'' 
 object.  This notion of ``standard'' comes from non-standard analysis and is 
 discussed in Ruben Gamboa's dissertation.  In brief, all the familiar objects 
 are standard: e.g., the familiar real numbers are standard, but non-zero 
 infinitesimals are not standard, and the familiar integers are standard, but 
 not those that exceed every integer that you can express in the usual way (1, 
 2, 3, and so on).  Similarly, the familiar lists are standard, but not so a 
 list that contains a large number of integers, where ``large'' means more than 
 the standard integers.  The set of standard numbers is closed under the usual 
 arithmetic operations, hence the sum of a standard number and a non-zero 
 infinitesimal is not standard, though it is what is called ``limited'' (see 
 <a href="ACL2____I-LIMITED.html">i-limited</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>This predicate is only defined in ACL2(r) (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>).</p>
