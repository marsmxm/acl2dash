<p>Carry out basic expression simplification. (UNSOUND)</p><p>This transform does a lot of basic rewriting of expressions, e.g., 
it will eliminate double negations, propagate constants through ANDs, use 
Demorgan's rule to simplify negated ANDs, pushing nots down into the branches 
of ?: expressions, and so forth.</p> 
 
<p><b>WARNING</b>: These transforms are almost certainly unsound in general. 
For instance, even something as simple as removing double negatives isn't 
stricly correct, <span class="v">~~A</span> will produce <span class="v">X</span> when <span class="v">A</span> is <span class="v">Z</span>.  On the 
other hand, these rewrites are <i>probably</i> okay if we only care about the 
Boolean values of expressions.</p> 
 
<p><b>BUT FOR SERIOUSLY -- WARNING</b>: I am really not too concerned with 
soundness here.  There are probably many things that could go wrong 
w.r.t. expression sizes, etc.  You should check that this produces reasonable 
output using an equivalence checker.</p>
