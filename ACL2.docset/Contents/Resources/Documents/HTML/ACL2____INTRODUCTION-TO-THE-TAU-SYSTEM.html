<p>A decision procedure for runtime types</p><p>This doc topic is the main source of information about the tau 
 system and discusses the general idea behind the procedure and how to exploit 
 it.</p> 
 
 <p><i>A ``Type-Checker'' for an Untyped Language</i></p> 
 
 <p>Because ACL2 is an untyped language it is impossible to type check it.  All 
 functions are total.  An <i>n</i>-ary function may be applied to any 
 combination of <i>n</i> ACL2 objects.  The syntax of ACL2 stipulates that 
 <span class="v">(</span><i>fn a1...an</i><span class="v">)</span> is a well-formed term if <i>fn</i> is a function 
 symbol of <i>n</i> arguments and the <i>ai</i> are well-formed terms.  No 
 mention is made of the ``types'' of terms.  That is what is meant by saying 
 ACL2 is an untyped language.</p> 
 
 <p>Nevertheless, the system provides a variety of monadic Boolean function 
 symbols, like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a></span>, etc., that 
 recognize different ``types'' of objects at runtime.  Users typically define 
 many more such recognizers for domain-specific ``types.''  Because of the 
 prevalence of such ``types,'' ACL2 must frequently reason about the inclusion 
 of one ``type'' in another.  It must also reason about the consequences of 
 functions being defined so as to produce objects of certain ``types'' when 
 given arguments of certain other ``types.''</p> 
 
 <p>Because the word ``type'' in computer science tends to imply syntactic or 
 semantic restrictions on functions, we avoid using that word henceforth. 
 Instead, we just reason about monadic Boolean predicates.  You may wish to 
 think of ``tau'' as synonymous with ``type'' but without any suggestion of 
 syntactic or semantic restrictions.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Design Philosophy</i></p> 
 
 <p>The following basic principles were kept in mind when developing tau 
 checker and may help you exploit it.</p> 
 
 <p>(1) The tau system is supposed to be a lightweight, fast, and helpful 
 decision procedure for an elementary subset of the logic focused on monadic 
 predicates and function signatures.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) Most subgoals produced by the theorem prover are not in any decidable 
 subset of the logic!  Thus, decision procedures fail to prove the vast 
 majority of the formulas they see and will be net time-sinks if tried too 
 often no matter how fast they are.</p> 
 
 <p>Tau reasoning is used by the prover as part of <span class="v">preprocess-clause</span>, one 
 of the first proof techniques the system tries.  The tau system filters out 
 ``obvious'' subgoals.  The tau system is only tried when subgoals first enter 
 the waterfall and when they are stable under simplification.</p> 
 
 <p>(3) The tau system is ``benign'' in the sense that the only way it 
 contributes to a proof is to eliminate (prove!) subgoals.  It does not 
 rewrite, simplify, or change formulas.  Tau reasoning is not used by the 
 rewriter.  The tau system either eliminates a subgoal by proving it or leaves 
 it unchanged.</p> 
 
 <p>(4) It is impossible to infer automatically the relations between arbitrary 
 recursively defined predicates and functions.  Thus, the tau system's 
 knowledge of tau relationships and function signatures is gleaned from 
 theorems stated by the user and proved by the system.</p> 
 
 <p>(5) Users wishing to build effective ``type-checkers'' for their models 
 must learn how rules affect the tau system's behavior.  There are two main 
 forms of tau rules: those that reveal inclusion/exclusion relations between 
 named tau predicates, e.g., that 16-bit naturals are also 32-bit naturals,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (n16p x) (n32p x)),</pre> 
 
 <p>and signatures for all relevant functions, e.g., writing a 32-bit natural 
 to a legal slot in a register file produces a register file:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> n)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> n 16)
              (n32p val)
              (register-filep regs))
         (register-filep (<a href="ACL2____UPDATE-NTH.html">update-nth</a> n val regs))).</pre> 
 
 <p>For a complete description of acceptable forms see <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>(6) The tau system is ``greedy'' in its efforts to augment its database. 
 Its database is potentially augmented when rules of <i>any</i> 
 <span class="v">:rule-class</span> (see <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span>) are proved.  For example, if 
 you make a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule which 
 expresses a relationship between one tau and another (e.g., that <span class="v">(P x)</span> 
 implies <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____Q.html">Q</a> x)</span>), ACL2 will build it into the tau database.  The rule-class 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a></span> can be used to add a rule to the tau database without 
 adding any other kind of rule.</p> 
 
 <p>(7) Greediness is forced into the design by benignity: the tau system may 
 ``know'' some fact that the rewriter does not, and because tau reasoning is 
 not used in rewriting, that missing fact must be conveyed to the rewriter 
 through some other class of rule, e.g., a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> or 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span> rule.  By 
 making the tau system greedy, we allow the user to program the rewriter and 
 the tau system simultaneously while keeping them separate.  However, this 
 means you must keep in mind the effects of a rule on <i>both</i> the rewriter 
 and the tau system and use <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a></span> rules explicitly when you 
 want to ``talk'' just to the tau system.</p> 
 
 <p>(8) Tau rules are built into the database with as much preprocessing as 
 possible (e.g., the system transitively closes inclusion/exclusion 
 relationships at rule-storage time) so the checker can be fast.</p> 
 
 <p>(9) For speed, tau does not track dependencies and is not sensitive to the 
 enabled/disabled status (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a></span>) of rules, 
 other than <a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> rules.  Once a fact has been built 
 into the tau database, the only way to prevent that fact from being used is by 
 disabling the entire tau system, by disabling <span class="v">(:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span><span class="v"> tau-system)</span>.  If any tau reasoning is used in a 
 proof, the rune <span class="v">(:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span><span class="v"> tau-system)</span> is 
 reported in the <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>.  For a complete list of all the runes in the 
 tau database, evaluate <span class="v">(get-tau-runes (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span>.  Any of these 
 associated theorems could have been used.</p> 
 
 <p>These design criteria are not always achieved!  For example, the tau 
 system's ``greediness'' can be turned off (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-TAU-AUTO-MODE.html">set-tau-auto-mode</a></span>), the 
 tau database can be regenerated from scratch to ignore disabled rules (see 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REGENERATE-TAU-DATABASE.html">regenerate-tau-database</a></span>), and disabling the <a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> of a tau predicate symbol will prevent the tau system 
 from trying to run the predicate on constants.  The tau system's benignity can 
 be frustrating since it might ``know'' something the rewriter does not.  More 
 problematically, the tau system is not always ``fast'' and not always 
 ``benign!''  The typical way tau reasoning can slow a proof down is by 
 evaluating expensive tau predicates on constants.  The typical way tau 
 reasoning can hurt a previously successful proof is by proving some subgoals 
 (!) and thus causing the remaining subgoals to have different <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-IDENTIFIER.html">clause-identifier</a>s, thus making explicit hints no longer applicable.  We deal 
 with such problems in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEALING-WITH-TAU-PROBLEMS.html">dealing-with-tau-problems</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Technical Details</i></p> 
 
 <p>The tau system consists of both a database and an algorithm for using the 
 database.  The database contains theorems that match certain schemas allowing 
 them to be stored in the tau database.  Roughly speaking the schemas encode 
 ``inclusion'' and ``exclusion'' relations, e.g., that <span class="v">natp</span> implies 
 <span class="v">integerp</span> and that <span class="v">integerp</span> implies not <span class="v">consp</span>, and they encode 
 ``signatures'' of functions, e.g., theorems that relate the output of a 
 function to the input, provided only tau predicates are involved.</p> 
 
 <p>By ``tau predicates'' we mean the application of a monadic Boolean-valued 
 function symbol, the equality of something to a quoted constant, an arithmetic 
 ordering relation between something and a rational constant, or the logical 
 negation of such a term.  Here are some examples of tau predicates:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> i)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> y 'MONDAY)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a> 23 k))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> 8 max)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> max 24)</pre> 
 
 <p>Synonyms for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> include <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span>. 
 Note that negated equalities are also allowed.  The arithmetic ordering 
 relations that may be used are <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____E3_D3.html">&gt;=</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____E3.html">&gt;</a></span>.  One of the arguments to every arithmetic ordering relation must be an 
 integer or rational constant for the term to be treated as a tau 
 predicate.</p> 
 
 <p>A ``tau'' is a data object representing a set of signed (positive or 
 negative) tau predicates whose meaning is the conjunction of the literals in 
 the set.</p> 
 
 <p>When we say that a term ``has'' a given tau we mean the term satisfies all 
 of the recognizers in that tau.</p> 
 
 <p>The tau algorithm is a decision procedure for the logical theory described 
 (only) by the rules in the database.  The algorithm takes a term and a list of 
 assumptions mapping subterms (typically variable symbols) to tau, and returns 
 the tau of the given term.</p> 
 
 <p>When the system is called upon to decide whether a term satisfies a given 
 monadic predicate, it computes the tau of the term and asks whether the 
 predicate is in that set.  More generally, to determine if a term satisfies a 
 tau, <i>s</i>, we compute a tau, <i>r</i>, for the term and ask whether 
 <i>s</i> is a subset of <i>r</i>.  To determine whether a constant, <i>c</i>, 
 satisfies tau <i>s</i> we apply each of the literals in <i>s</i> to <i>c</i>. 
 Evaluation might, of course, be time-consuming for complex user-defined 
 predicates.</p> 
 
 <p>The tau database contains rules derived from definitions and theorems 
 stated by the user.  See <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a></span> for a description of the 
 acceptable forms of tau rules.</p> 
 
 <p>To shut off the greedy augmentation of the tau database, see <a href="ACL2____SET-TAU-AUTO-MODE.html">set-tau-auto-mode</a>.  This may be of use to users who wish to tightly control 
 the rules in the tau database.  To add a rule to the tau database without 
 adding any other kind of rule, use the rule class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>There are some slight complexities in the design related to how we handle 
 events with both <span class="v">:tau-system</span> corollaries and corollaries of other 
 <span class="v">:rule-classes</span>, see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-TAU-AUTO-MODE.html">set-tau-auto-mode</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>To prevent tau reasoning from being used, disable the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span> of <span class="v">tau-system</span>, i.e., execute</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> (:executable-counterpart tau-system)))</pre> 
 
 <p>or, equivalently,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> (<a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>)))</pre> 
 
 <p>To prevent tau from being used in the proof of a particular subgoal, 
 locally disable the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span> of <span class="v">tau-system</span> 
 with a local <span class="v">:in-theory</span> hint (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>The event command <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAU-STATUS.html">tau-status</a></span> is a macro that can be used to toggle 
 both whether tau reasoning is globally enabled and whether the tau database is 
 augmented greedily.  For example, the event</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TAU-STATUS.html">tau-status</a> :system nil :auto-mode nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>prevents the tau system from being used in proofs and prevents the 
 augmentation of the tau database by rules other than those explicitly labeled 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a></span>.</p>
