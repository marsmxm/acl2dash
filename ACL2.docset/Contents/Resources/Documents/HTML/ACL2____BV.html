<p>The BV library for reasoning about bit-vectors</p><p>See books/kestrel/bv/.</p><p>The BV library deals with "bit vectors" which are, conceptually, 
finite sequences of bits (0s and 1s).  The library includes many 
operations on bit vectors, including operations which interpret bit 
vectors as unsigned or signed integers.</p><p>Bit vectors of size M are represented as natural numbers less than 2^M 
in a straightforward way: The bits in a bit vector are numbered 
starting at 0 (the least significant bit) and correspond to the bits 
in the binary representation of the number.  A 1 bit in position N 
contributes 2^N to the value of the number.</p><p>We usually visualize a bit vector with bit position 0 at the far 
right.  For example, here is how we visualize the bit vector 
represented by the number 17 (= 2^4 + 2^0): 
<pre class="code">value    1   0   0   0   1
index: | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |</pre> 
We say that a bit vector has size M if its most significant (highest 
indexed) 1 bit has index at most M-1. Note that the size of a bit 
vector is not unique; any bit vector of size M is also a bit vector of 
size M+1 and of any larger size.  However, the operators in the BV 
library take explicit size arguments.  Bit vector arguments that do 
not fit into the indicated sizes are chopped down to the indicated 
sizes, and the result is also chopped down (if needed) so that a bit 
vector of the indicated size is always returned.</p><p>The connection between bit vectors and natural numbers is a deep one. 
Indeed we use constants such as 0 and 17 to represent particular bit 
vectors.  But it is sometimes helpful to view BVs and natural numbers 
as two distinct types.</p><p>The standard recognizer for a bit vector is the built-in ACL2 predicate 
unsigned-byte-p.</p><p>Bit vectors can also be interpreted as signed numbers using a standard 
twos-complement representation.  A bit vector of size M is taken to 
represent numbers in the range [-2^(M-1), 2^(M-1)-1].  This matches 
the behavior of the ACL2 predicate signed-byte-p.)</p>
