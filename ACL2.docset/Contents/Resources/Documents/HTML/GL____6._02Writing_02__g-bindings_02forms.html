<p></p> 
 
<p>In a typical <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a> command, the <span class="v">:g-bindings</span> should have an 
entry for every free variable in the theorem.  Here is an example that shows 
some typical bindings.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">:g-bindings '((flag   (:g-boolean . 0))
              (a-bus  (:g-integer 1 3 5 7 9))
              (b-bus  (:g-integer 2 4 6 8 10))
              (mode   (:g-ite (:g-boolean . 11) exact . fast))
              (opcode #b0010100))</pre> 
 
<p>These bindings allow <span class="v">flag</span> to take an arbitrary Boolean value, 
<span class="v">a-bus</span> and <span class="v">b-bus</span> any five-bit signed integer values, <span class="v">mode</span> either 
the symbol <span class="v">exact</span> or <span class="v">fast</span>, and <span class="v">opcode</span> only the value 20.</p> 
 
<p>(Aside: Note that since <span class="v">#b0010100</span> is not within a <span class="v">:g-boolean</span> or 
<span class="v">:g-integer</span> form, it is <b>not</b> the index of a Boolean variable. 
Instead, like the symbols <span class="v">exact</span> and <span class="v">fast</span>, it is just an ordinary ACL2 
constant that stands for itself, i.e., 20.)</p> 
 
<p>These <span class="v">:g-boolean</span> and <span class="v">:g-integer</span> are called <a href="GL____SHAPE-SPECS.html">shape-specs</a>. 
They are similar to the symbolic objects GL uses to compute with, except that 
natural number indices take the places of Boolean expressions.  The indices 
used throughout all of the bindings must be distinct, and represent free, 
independent Boolean variables.</p> 
 
<p>In BDD mode, these indices have additional meaning: they specify the BDD 
variable ordering, with smaller indices coming first in the order.  This 
ordering can greatly affect performance.  In AIG mode the choice of indices has 
no particular bearing on efficiency.</p> 
 
<p>How do you choose a good BDD ordering?  It is often good to interleave the 
bits of data buses that are going to be combined in some way.  It is also 
typically a good idea to put any important control signals such as opcodes and 
mode settings before the data buses.</p> 
 
<p>Often the same <span class="v">:g-bindings</span> can be used throughout several theorems, 
either verbatim or with only small changes.  In practice, we almost always 
generate the <span class="v">:g-bindings</span> forms by calling functions or macros.  One 
convenient function is</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="GL____G-INT.html">g-int</a> start by n)</pre> 
 
<p>which generates a <span class="v">:g-integer</span> form with <span class="v">n</span> bits, using 
indices that start at <span class="v">start</span> and increment by <span class="v">by</span>.  This is 
particularly useful for interleaving the bits of numbers, as we did for the 
<span class="v">a-bus</span> and <span class="v">b-bus</span> bindings above:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="GL____G-INT.html">g-int</a> 1 2 5)  ---&gt; (:g-integer 1 3 5 7 9)
(<a href="GL____G-INT.html">g-int</a> 2 2 5)  ---&gt; (:g-integer 2 4 6 8 10)</pre> 
 
<p>Writing out <span class="v">:g-bindings</span> and getting all the indices can be tedious. 
See <a href="GL____AUTO-BINDINGS.html">auto-bindings</a> for a convenient macro that helps ensure that all the 
indices are different.</p>
