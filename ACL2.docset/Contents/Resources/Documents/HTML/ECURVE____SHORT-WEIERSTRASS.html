<p>Fixtype of elliptic curves over prime fields 
          in short Weierstrass form.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>p — <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>a — <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>b — <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><h5>Additional Requirements</h5><p>The following invariant is enforced on the fields:</p><pre class="code">(and (&gt; p 3) 
     (fep a p) 
     (fep b p) 
     (posp (mod (+ (* 4 a a a) (* 27 b b)) p))) 
</pre><p>This kind of curve is specified by 
     the prime p and the coefficients a and b; 
     see <a href="ECURVE____SHORT-WEIERSTRASS-CURVES.html">short-weierstrass-curves</a>. 
     Thus, we formalize a curve as a triple of these numbers, 
     via a fixtype product.</p><p>Because <span class="v">primep</span> is slow on large numbers, 
     we do not include this requirement into the fixtype; 
     otherwise, it may take a long time to construct a value of this fixtype 
     for a practical curve. 
     We just require p to be greater than 3; 
     see <a href="ECURVE____SHORT-WEIERSTRASS-CURVES.html">short-weierstrass-curves</a>. 
     We express the primality of p separately.</p><p>We require a and b to be in the prime field of p. 
     We also require them to satisfy the condition ensuring that 
     the cubic equation has no multiple roots; 
     see <a href="ECURVE____SHORT-WEIERSTRASS-CURVES.html">short-weierstrass-curves</a>. 
     We express this condition by saying that 
     4 a^3 + 27 b^2 \mod p &gt; 0, 
     where the operations are not field operations: 
     this formulation is equivalent to requiring 4 a^3 + 27 b^2 
     with field operation to be different from 0.</p><p>To fix the three components to satisfy the requirements above, 
     we pick 5 for p, 0 for a, and 1 for b. 
     It would be fine to pick 4 for p as far as this fixtype is concerned 
     (since primality is not captured in the fixtype requirements), 
     but we pick a prime (the smallest one above 3) 
     since we know that this should be a prime.</p>
