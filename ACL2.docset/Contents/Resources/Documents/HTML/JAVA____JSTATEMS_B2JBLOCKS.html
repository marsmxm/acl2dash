<p>Java statements and blocks [JLS:14].</p><p>Unlike [JLS:14.2], 
     we do not distinguish between statements and block statements: 
     we just have block statements, and call them statements.</p><p>We do not capture 
     class declarations, 
     the empty statement, 
     labeled statements, 
     <span class="v">synchronized</span>, and 
     <span class="v">try</span>.</p><p>We only capture <span class="v">if</span> statements 
     whose <span class="v">then</span> (and <span class="v">else</span>, if present) parts are blocks. 
     (This is not a significant limitation.)</p><p>We only capture <span class="v">for</span> statements 
     with single initialization and update expressions, 
     and whose bodies are block. 
     (The latter is not a significant limitation.)</p><p>We only capture <span class="v">do</span> statements whose bodies are block. 
     (This is not a significant limitation.)</p><p>We only capture <span class="v">continue</span> and <span class="v">break</span> statements 
     without labels.</p>
