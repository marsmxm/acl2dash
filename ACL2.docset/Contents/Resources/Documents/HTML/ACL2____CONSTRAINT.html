<p>Restrictions on certain functions introduced in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a></p><p>Suppose that a given theorem, <span class="v">thm</span>, is to be functionally 
 instantiated using a given functional substitution, <span class="v">alist</span>.  (See <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>, or for an example, see <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION-EXAMPLE.html">functional-instantiation-example</a>.)  What is the set of proof obligations 
 generated?  It is the set obtained by applying <span class="v">alist</span> to all terms, 
 <span class="v">tm</span>, such that (a) <span class="v">tm</span> mentions some function symbol in the domain of 
 <span class="v">alist</span>, and (b) either (i) <span class="v">tm</span> is the ``constraint'' (see below) on a 
 function symbol ancestral in <span class="v">thm</span> or in some <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> or (ii) 
 <span class="v">tm</span> is the body of a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>.  Here, a function symbol is 
 ``ancestral'' in <span class="v">thm</span> if either it occurs in <span class="v">thm</span>, or it occurs in the 
 definition of some function symbol that occurs in <span class="v">thm</span>, and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>The remainder of this note explains what we mean by ``constraint'' in the 
 words above.  For a utility that obtains the constraint for a given function 
 symbol, see <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT-INFO.html">constraint-info</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>In a certain sense, function symbols are introduced in essentially two 
 ways.  The most common way is to use <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> (or when there is mutual 
 recursion, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUNS.html">defuns</a></span>).  There is also a 
 mechanism for introducing ``witness functions''; see <a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>.  The 
 documentation for these <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> describes the axioms they introduce, 
 which we will call here their ``definitional axioms.''  These definitional 
 axioms are generally the constraints on the function symbols that these axioms 
 introduce.</p> 
 
 <p>However, when a function symbol is introduced in the scope of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event, its constraints may differ from the definitional axioms 
 introduced for it.  For example, suppose that a function's definition is 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>; that is, suppose the function is 
 introduced in the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>.  Then its 
 constraints include, at the least, those non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> theorems and 
 definitions in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> that mention the function symbol.</p> 
 
 <p>Actually, it will follow from the discussion below that if the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> is empty for an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, then the constraint on each of 
 its new function symbols is exactly the definitional axiom introduced for it. 
 Intuitively, we view such <span class="v">encapsulates</span> just as we view <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  But the general case, where the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> 
 is not empty, is more complicated.</p> 
 
 <p>In the discussion that follows we describe in detail exactly which 
 constraints are associated with which function symbols that are introduced in 
 the scope of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event.  In order to simplify the 
 exposition we make two cuts at it.  In the first cut we present an 
 over-simplified explanation that nevertheless captures the main ideas.  In the 
 second cut we complete our explanation by explaining how we view certain <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> as being ``lifted'' out of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, resulting in a 
 possibly smaller <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, which becomes the target of the 
 algorithm described in the first cut.</p> 
 
 <p>At the end of this note we present an example showing why a more naive 
 approach is unsound.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, before we start our ``first cut,'' we note that any information 
 you want ``exported'' outside an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event must be there as an 
 explicit definition or theorem.  For example, even if a function <span class="v">foo</span> has 
 output type <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> t t)</span> in its <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>, the system will not know 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> (foo x))</span> merely on account of this information.  Thus, if you 
 are using functions like <span class="v">foo</span> (constrained <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> functions), then you 
 may find it useful to prove (inside the <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, to be exported) a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule for the constrained function, for 
 example, the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> (foo
 x))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><i>First cut at constraint-assigning algorithm.</i> Consider the set of 
 formulas introduced by all <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in the scope of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>for every <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> event, include its formula 
 as well as the formulas of all its corollaries;</li> 
 
 <li>for every <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> event, include the formula that equates the body 
 with the application of the function applied to the formals;</li> 
 
 <li>for every <span class="v">defchoose</span> event, include the axiom that it adds (see <a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a>);</li> 
 
 <li>and so on, including axioms added by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> and (recursively) any 
 subsidiary <span class="v">encapsulate</span> events.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Then quite simply, all such formulas are conjoined, and each function 
 symbol introduced by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> is assigned that conjunction as 
 its constraint.</p> 
 
 <p>Clearly this is a rather severe algorithm.  Let us consider two possible 
 optimizations in an informal manner before presenting our second cut.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider the (rather artificial) event below.  The function <span class="v">before1</span> 
 does not refer at all, even indirectly, to the locally-introduced function 
 <span class="v">sig-fn</span>, so it is unfortunate to saddle it with constraints about 
 <span class="v">sig-fn</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))

 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> before1 (x)
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
       (before1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))
     x))

 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sig-fn (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x)))

 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> sig-fn-prop
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (sig-fn x)))
 )</pre> 
 
 <p>We would like to imagine moving the definition of <span class="v">before1</span> to just in 
 front of this <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> before1 (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
      (before1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))
    x))

(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))

 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sig-fn (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x)))

 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> sig-fn-prop
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (sig-fn x)))
 )</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, we will only assign the constraint <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (sig-fn x))</span>, from the 
 theorem <span class="v">sig-fn-prop</span>, to the function <span class="v">sig-fn</span>, not to the function 
 <span class="v">before1</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>More generally, suppose an event in an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event does not 
 mention any function symbol in the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, nor any function symbol that mentions any such function symbol, 
 and so on.  (We might say that no function symbol from the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a> is 
 an ``ancestor'' of any function symbol occurring in the event.)  Then we 
 imagine moving the event, so that it appears in front of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>.  We don't actually move it, but we pretend we do when it comes 
 time to assign constraints.  Thus, such definitions only introduce 
 definitional axioms as the constraints on the function symbols being defined. 
 In the example above, the event <span class="v">sig-fn-prop</span> introduces no constraints on 
 function <span class="v">before1</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Once this first optimization is performed, we have in mind a set of 
 ``constrained functions.''  These are the functions introduced in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> that would remain after moving some of them in front, as 
 indicated above.  Consider the collection of all formulas introduced by the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, except the definitional axioms, that mention these 
 constrained functions.  So for example, in the event below, no such formula 
 mentions the function symbol <span class="v">after1</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))

 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sig-fn (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x)))

 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> sig-fn-prop
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (sig-fn x)))

 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> after1 (x)
   (sig-fn x))
 )</pre> 
 
 <p>We can see that there is really no harm in imagining that we move the 
 definition of <span class="v">after1</span> out of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, to just after the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Many subtle aspects of this rearrangement process have been omitted.  For 
 example, suppose the function <span class="v">fn</span> uses <span class="v">sig-fn</span>, the latter being a 
 function in the signature of the encapsulation.  Suppose a formula about 
 <span class="v">fn</span> is proved in the encapsulation.  Then from the discussion above 
 <span class="v">fn</span> is among the constrained functions of the encapsulate: it cannot be 
 moved before the encapsulate and it cannot be moved after the encapsulation. 
 But why is <span class="v">fn</span> constrained?  The reason is that the theorem proved about 
 <span class="v">fn</span> may impose or express constraints on <span class="v">sig-fn</span>.  That is, the 
 theorem proved about <span class="v">fn</span> may depend upon properties of the witness used 
 for <span class="v">sig-fn</span>.  Here is a simple example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))

 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sig-fn (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IGNORE.html">ignore</a> x)) 0))

 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> fn (lst)
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
       t
       (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> (sig-fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)))
            (fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst)))))

 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> fn-always-true
   (fn lst)))</pre> 
 
 <p>In this example, there are no <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> events that mention 
 <span class="v">sig-fn</span> explicitly.  One might therefore conclude that it is completely 
 unconstrained.  But the witness we chose for it always returns an integer. 
 The function <span class="v">fn</span> uses <span class="v">sig-fn</span> and we prove that <span class="v">fn</span> always returns 
 true.  Of course, the proof of this theorem depends upon the properties of the 
 witness for <span class="v">sig-fn</span>, even though those properties were not explicitly 
 ``called out'' in theorems proved about <span class="v">sig-fn</span>.  It would be unsound to 
 move <span class="v">fn-always-true</span> after the encapsulate.  It would also be unsound to 
 constrain <span class="v">sig-fn</span> to satisfy just <span class="v">fn-always-true</span> without including in 
 the constraint the relation between <span class="v">sig-fn</span> and <span class="v">fn</span>.  Hence both 
 <span class="v">sig-fn</span> and <span class="v">fn</span> are constrained by this encapsulation and the 
 constraint imposed on each is the same and states the relation between the two 
 as characterized by the equation defining <span class="v">fn</span> as well as the property that 
 <span class="v">fn</span> always returns true.  Suppose, later, one proved a theorem about 
 <span class="v">sig-fn</span> and wished to functionally instantiate it.  Then one must also 
 functionally instantiate <span class="v">fn</span>, even if it is not involved in the theorem, 
 because it is only through <span class="v">fn</span> that <span class="v">sig-fn</span> inherits its constrained 
 properties.</p> 
 
 <p>This is a pathological example that illustrate a trap into which one may 
 easily fall: rather than identify the key properties of the constrained 
 function the user has foreshadowed its intended application and constrained 
 those notions.  Clearly, the user wishing to introduce the <span class="v">sig-fn</span> above 
 would be well-advised to use the following instead:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 (((sig-fn *) =&gt; *))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sig-fn (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IGNORE.html">ignore</a> x)) 0))
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> integerp-sig-fn
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> (sig-fn x))))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> fn (lst)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      t
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> (sig-fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)))
         (fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst)))))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> fn-always-true
   (fn lst)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">sig-fn</span> is constrained merely to be an integer.  It is the 
 only constrained function.  Now <span class="v">fn</span> is introduced after the encapsulation, 
 as a simple function that uses <span class="v">sig-fn</span>.  We prove that <span class="v">fn</span> always 
 returns true, but this fact does not constrain <span class="v">sig-fn</span>.  Future uses of 
 <span class="v">sig-fn</span> do not have to consider <span class="v">fn</span> at all.</p> 
 
 <p>Sometimes it is necessary to introduce a function such as <span class="v">fn</span> within 
 the <span class="v">encapsulate</span> merely to state the key properties of the undefined 
 function <span class="v">sig-fn</span>.  But that is unusual and the user should understand that 
 both functions are being constrained.</p> 
 
 <p>Another subtle aspect of encapsulation that has been brushed over so far 
 has to do with exactly how functions defined within the encapsulation use the 
 signature functions.  For example, above we say ``Consider the collection of 
 all formulas introduced by the encapsulate, <i>except the definitional 
 axioms</i>, that mention these constrained functions.''  We seem to suggest 
 that a definitional axiom which mentions a constrained function can be moved 
 out of the encapsulation and considered part of the ``post-encapsulation'' 
 extension of the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, if the defined function is not used in 
 any non-definitional formula proved in the encapsulation.  For example, in the 
 encapsulation above that constrained <span class="v">sig-fn</span> and introduced <span class="v">fn</span> within 
 the encapsulation, <span class="v">fn</span> was constrained because we proved the formula 
 <span class="v">fn-always-true</span> within the encapsulation.  Had we not proved 
 <span class="v">fn-always-true</span> within the encapsulation, <span class="v">fn</span> could have been moved 
 after the encapsulation.  But this suggests an unsound rule because whether 
 such a function can be moved after the encapsulate depend on whether its 
 <i>admission</i> used properties of the witnesses!  In particular, we say a 
 function is ``subversive'' if any of its governing tests or the actuals in any 
 recursive call involve a function in which the signature functions are 
 ancestral.  See <a href="ACL2____INFECTED-CONSTRAINTS.html">infected-constraints</a> and see <a href="ACL2____SUBVERSIVE-RECURSIONS.html">subversive-recursions</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(Aside: The definition of <span class="v">fn</span> in the first encapsulation above that 
 defines <span class="v">fn</span>, i.e., the encapsulation with <span class="v">fn-always-true</span> inside, is 
 subversive because the call of the macro <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a></span> expands to a call of 
 <span class="v">IF</span> that governs a recursive call of <span class="v">fn</span>, in this case:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> fn (lst)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      t
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> (sig-fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)))
          (fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst))
        nil))).</pre> 
 
 <p>If we switch the order of conjuncts in <span class="v">fn</span>, then the definition of 
 <span class="v">fn</span> is no longer subversive, but it still ``infects'' the constraint 
 generated for the encapsulation, hence for <span class="v">sig-fn</span>, because 
 <span class="v">fn-always-true</span> blocks the definition of <span class="v">fn</span> from being moved back (to 
 after the encapsulation).  Also see <a href="ACL2____INFECTED-CONSTRAINTS.html">infected-constraints</a>.  If we both 
 switch the order of conjuncts and drop <span class="v">fn-always-true</span> from the 
 encapsulation, then the definition of <span class="v">fn</span> is in essence moved back to 
 after the encapsulation, and the constraint for <span class="v">sig-fn</span> no longer includes 
 the definition of <span class="v">fn</span>.  End of aside.)</p> 
 
 <p>Another aspect we have not discussed is what happens to nested 
 encapsulations when each introduces constrained functions.  We say an 
 <span class="v">encapsulate</span> event is ``trivial'' if it introduces no constrained 
 functions, i.e., if its signatures is <span class="v">nil</span>.  Trivial encapsulations are 
 just a way to wrap up a collection of events into a single event.</p> 
 
 <p>From the foregoing discussion we see we are interested in exactly how we 
 can ``rearrange'' the events in a non-trivial encapsulation — moving 
 some ``before'' the encapsulation and others ``after'' the encapsulation.  We 
 are also interested in which functions introduced by the encapsulation are 
 ``constrained'' and what the ``constraints'' on each are.  We may summarize 
 the observations above as follows, after which we conclude with a more 
 elaborate example.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Second cut at constraint-assigning algorithm.</i> First, we focus only 
 on non-trivial encapsulations that neither contain nor are contained in 
 non-trivial encapsulations.  (Nested non-trivial encapsulations are not 
 rearranged at all: do not put anything in such a nest unless you mean for it 
 to become part of the constraints generated.)  Second, in what follows we only 
 consider the non-<span class="v">local</span> events of such an <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, assuming that 
 they satisfy the restriction of using no locally defined function symbols 
 other than the signature functions.  Given such an <span class="v">encapsulate</span> event, 
 move, to just in front of it and in the same order, all definitions and 
 theorems for which none of the signature functions is ancestral.  Now collect 
 up all formulas (theorems) introduced in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> other than 
 definitional axioms.  Add to this set any of those definitional equations that 
 is either subversive or defines a function used in a formula in the set.  The 
 conjunction of the resulting set of formulas is called the ``constraint'' and 
 the set of all the signature functions of the <span class="v">encapsulate</span> together with 
 all function symbols defined in the <span class="v">encapsulate</span> and mentioned in the 
 constraint is called the ``constrained functions.''  Assign the constraint to 
 each of the constrained functions.  Move, to just after the <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, 
 the definitions of all function symbols defined in the <span class="v">encapsulate</span> that 
 have been omitted from the constraint.</p> 
 
 <p>Implementation note.  In the implementation we do not actually move <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, but we create constraints that pretend that we did.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is an example illustrating our constraint-assigning algorithm.  It 
 builds on the preceding examples.</p>

 <p>Only the functions <span class="v">sig-fn</span> and <span class="v">during</span> receive extra constraints. 
 The functions <span class="v">before1</span> and <span class="v">before2</span> are viewed as moving in front of 
 the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, as is the theorem <span class="v">before2-prop</span>.  The functions 
 <span class="v">after1</span> and <span class="v">after2</span> are viewed as being moved past the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>.  The implementation reports the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">In addition to SIG-FN, we export AFTER2, AFTER1, BEFORE2, DURING and
BEFORE1.

The following constraint is associated with both of the functions DURING and
SIG-FN:

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (DURING X)
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">IF</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)
                X (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> (SIG-FN X)) 17)))
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> (SIG-FN X))
     (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">ATOM</a> X) (BEFORE2 X))
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> (DURING X))
                     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> (SIG-FN X)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Notice that the formula <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (during x))</span> is not a conjunct of the 
 constraint.  During the first pass of the <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, this formula is 
 stored as a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule deduced during the definition 
 of the function <span class="v">during</span>.  However, the rule is not exported because of a 
 rather subtle soundness issue.  (If you are interested in details, see the 
 comments in source function <span class="v">putprop-type-prescription-lst</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude by asking (and to a certain extent, answering) the following 
 question: Isn't there an approach to assigning constraints that avoids 
 over-constraining more simply than our ``second cut'' above?  Perhaps it seems 
 that given an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, we should simply assign to each locally 
 defined function the theorems exported about that function.  If we adopted 
 that simple approach the events below would be admissible.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 (((foo *) =&gt; *))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) x))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> bar (x)
   (foo x))
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bar-prop
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (bar x) x)
   :rule-classes nil))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> foo-id
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (foo x) x)
  :hints (("Goal" :use bar-prop)))

; The following event is not admissible in ACL2.

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> ouch!
  nil
  :rule-classes nil
  :hints
  (("Goal" :use
    ((:functional-instance foo-id
                           (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x))))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Under the simple approach we have in mind, <span class="v">bar</span> is constrained to 
 satisfy both its definition and <span class="v">bar-prop</span> because <span class="v">bar</span> mentions a 
 function declared in the signature list of the encapsulation.  In fact, 
 <span class="v">bar</span> is so-constrained in the ACL2 semantics of encapsulation and the 
 first two events above (the <span class="v">encapsulate</span> and the consequence that <span class="v">foo</span> 
 must be the identity function) are actually admissible.  But under the simple 
 approach to assigning constraints, <span class="v">foo</span> is unconstrained because no 
 theorem about it is exported.  Under that approach, <span class="v">ouch!</span> is provable 
 because <span class="v">foo</span> can be instantiated in <span class="v">foo-id</span> to a function other than 
 the identity function.</p> 
 
 <p>It's tempting to think we can fix this by including definitions, not just 
 theorems, in constraints.  But consider the following slightly more elaborate 
 example.  The problem is that we need to include as a constraint on <span class="v">foo</span> 
 not only the definition of <span class="v">bar</span>, which mentions <span class="v">foo</span> explicitly, but 
 also <span class="v">abc</span>, which has <span class="v">foo</span> as an ancestor.</p>
