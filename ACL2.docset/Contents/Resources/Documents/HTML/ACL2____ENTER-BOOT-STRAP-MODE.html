<p>The first millisecond of the Big Bang</p><p>ACL2 functions, e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>, that show 
 <span class="v">enter-boot-strap-mode</span> as their defining <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> are in fact <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">primitive</a>s.  It is impossible for the system to display defining axioms about 
 these symbols.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Enter-boot-strap-mode</span> is a Common Lisp function but not an ACL2 
 function.  It magically creates from <span class="v">nil</span> an ACL2 property list <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> that lets us start the boot-strapping process.  That is, once 
 <span class="v">enter-boot-strap-mode</span> has created its <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, it is possible to 
 process the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span>s, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>s, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>s, 
 necessary to bring up the rest of the system.  Before that <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> is 
 created, the attempt by ACL2 even to translate a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> form, say, 
 would produce an error because <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> is undefined.</p> 
 
 <p>Several ACL2 functions show <span class="v">enter-boot-strap-mode</span> as their defining 
 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>.  Among them are <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>, and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span>.  These functions are characterized by axioms rather than 
 definitional equations â€” axioms that in most cases are built into our 
 code and hence do not have any explicit representation among the rules and 
 formulas in the system.</p>
