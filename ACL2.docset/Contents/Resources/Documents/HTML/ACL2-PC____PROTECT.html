 instruction ``fails'', the state-stack reverts to what it was before the 
 <span class="v">protect</span> instruction began, and <span class="v">restore</span> is given the same meaning 
 that it had before the <span class="v">protect</span> instruction began.  See <a href="ACL2-PC____DO-STRICT.html">ACL2-pc::do-strict</a>.</p>
