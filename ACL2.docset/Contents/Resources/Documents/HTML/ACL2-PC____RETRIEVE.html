General Form:

 <p>Must be used from <span class="v">outside</span> the interactive proof-builder loop.  If name 
 (which must be a symbol) is supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>, this causes re-entry to 
 the interactive proof-builder loop in the state at which <span class="v">save</span> was last 
 executed for the indicated name.  (See <a href="ACL2-PC____SAVE.html">ACL2-pc::save</a>.)  If <span class="v">name</span> is 
 <span class="v">nil</span> or is not supplied, then the user is queried regarding which 
 proof-builder state to re-enter.  The query is omitted, however, if there only 
 one proof-builder state is present that was saved with <span class="v">save</span>, in which 
 case that is the one that is used.  Also see <a href="ACL2-PC____UNSAVE.html">ACL2-pc::unsave</a>.</p>
