<p>OS-specific system call numbers</p><p>System call numbers differ among different operating 
  systems.  For example, on Linux machines, the read syscall number is 
  <span class="v">0</span> but on Darwin machines, it is <span class="v">3</span>.  The x86 model 
  currently supports syscall numbers for Linux and Darwin operating 
  systems only.</p> 
 
<p>For the x86isa model, we define the syscall numbers based on the 
contents of the <span class="v">os-info</span> field of the x86 state. Currently 
supported values of this field are <span class="v">:linux</span> and <span class="v">:darwin</span>, with 
<span class="v">:linux</span> being the default value. Note that the field <span class="v">os-info</span> 
is meaningful only in the <a href="X86ISA____APP-VIEW.html">app-view</a>.</p>
