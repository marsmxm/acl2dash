<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PRINTING">Click for Set-waterfall-printing in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>For ACL2(p): configuring the printing that occurs within the parallelized waterfall</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic relates to the experimental 
 extension of ACL2 supporting parallel execution and proof; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PRINTING.html">set-waterfall-printing</a> :full)    ; print everything
(<a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PRINTING.html">set-waterfall-printing</a> :limited) ; print a subset that's thought to be useful
(<a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PRINTING.html">set-waterfall-printing</a> :very-limited) ; print an even smaller subset</pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Set-waterfall-printing</span> evaluates its argument, which indicates how 
 much printing should occur when executing ACL2 with the parallelized version 
 of the waterfall.  It only affects the printing that occurs when parallelism 
 mode is enabled for the waterfall (see <a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">:full</span> is intended to print the same output as in serial 
 mode.  This output will be interleaved unless the waterfall-parallelism mode 
 is one of <span class="v">nil</span> or <span class="v">:pseudo-parallel</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">:limited</span> omits most of the output that occurs in the serial 
 version of the waterfall.  Instead, the proof attempt prints key checkpoints 
 (see <a href="ACL2____ACL2P-KEY-CHECKPOINTS.html">ACL2p-key-checkpoints</a>).  The value of <span class="v">:limited</span> also prints 
 messages that indicate which subgoal is currently being proved, along with the 
 wall-clock time elapsed since the theorem began its proof; and if state global 
 <span class="v">'waterfall-printing-when-finished</span> has a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value, then such a 
 message will also be printed at the completion of each subgoal.  The function 
 <span class="v">print-clause-id-okp</span> may receive an attachment to limit such printing; see 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-CLAUSE-IDS.html">set-print-clause-ids</a>.  Naturally, these subgoal numbers can appear out 
 of order, because the subgoals can be proved in parallel.</p> 
 
 <p>A value of <span class="v">:very-limited</span> is treated the same as <span class="v">:limited</span>, except 
 that instead of printing subgoal numbers, the proof attempt prints a period 
 (`<span class="v">.</span>') each time it starts a new subgoal.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that this form cannot be used at the top level of a book, or of a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> event.  Here is a workaround for use in 
 such contexts; of course, you may replace <span class="v">:very-limited</span> with any other 
 legal argument for <span class="v">set-waterfall-printing</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> (<a href="ACL2____ER-PROGN.html">er-progn</a> (<a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PRINTING.html">set-waterfall-printing</a> :very-limited)

 <p>(For more about event contexts and the use of <span class="v">make-event</span>, see <a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>, in particular the section ``Restriction to Event Contexts.'')</p> 
 
 <p>The following form has the effect described above, except that it will 
 affect waterfall-printing even when including a certified book that contains 
 it.</p>

            :check-expansion t)</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">set-waterfall-printing</span> is automatically called by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>To enable the printing of information when a subgoal is finished, assign a 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> value to global <span class="v">waterfall-printing-when-finished</span>.  This can 
 be accomplished by entering the following at the top level:</p>
