<p>Restricting and modifying <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> 
certification using <span class="v">make</span>.</p><p>You can restrict the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> to be certified using <span class="v">make</span> 
  by adding a stylized ``<span class="v">cert_param:</span>'' comment.  For example, suppose that 
  you include the following comment in your book or in a corresponding 
  <span class="v">.acl2</span> file (see <a href="BUILD____PRE-CERTIFY-BOOK-COMMANDS.html">pre-certify-book-commands</a>).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; cert_param: (<a href="BUILD____CCL-ONLY.html">ccl-only</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>Then your <span class="v">make</span> command will only certify that book if your host Lisp 
 is CCL.  Moreover, if your host Lisp is not CCL, then <span class="v">make</span> will skip not 
 only the certification of that book but will also not attempt to certify any 
 book that includes it (and recursively).</p> 
 
 <p>The syntax for <span class="v">cert_param</span> comments is as follows, where the whitespace 
 is optional, and each entry without an '<span class="v">=</span>' is just set to 1, that is, it 
 is activated as described below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; cert_param: ( foo = bar , baz = 1 , bla )</pre> 
 
 <p>The meaning of an activated <span class="v">cert_param</span> is generally clear from its 
 name, as follows.  Additional <span class="v">cert_param</span> values might be supported in the 
 future; you can browse <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> file <span class="v">build/cert.pl</span> for 
 additional supported values.  The <span class="v">acl2x</span>, <span class="v">acl2xskip</span>, and 
 <span class="v">reloc_stub</span> values affect only the book itself, not books that include it. 
 However, the other values affect not only the certification of the indicated 
 book but also apply to all books that include it (and recursively).</p>

 of STP, even when an executable for it seems to be available, set environment 
 variable <span class="v">ACL2_DONT_USE_STP</span> to any non-empty value)</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">uses-quicklisp</span>: only certify when quicklisp is available</li>
