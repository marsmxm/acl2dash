<p>How to commit code to the books using direct push access</p><p>This guide is written for two groups of people:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Users of the ACL2 System and Books who do not plan to contribute to the 
 books, and</li> 
 
 <li>Contributors who commit to the repository on a monthly or weekly basis. 
 In this case, a contributor will typically begin with the <a href="ACL2____GITHUB-COMMIT-CODE-USING-PULL-REQUESTS.html">github-commit-code-using-pull-requests</a> method, and after they are familiar 
 with the process and community, they will move to this method.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h2>(A) GETTING STARTED</h2> 
 
 <p>Start by obtaining an up-to-date copy of the web-based github repository. 
 Here, we show how to put it into into a directory called <span class="tt">ACL2</span> (but 
 name it whatever you like).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">mkdir ACL2
cd ACL2
git clone https://github.com/acl2/acl2 .</pre> 
 
 <h2>(B) UPDATING</h2> 
 
 <p>The following commands will update your directory to match the latest 
 contents of the github repository (on the web).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">git fetch --all
git merge remotes/origin/master</pre> 
 
 <h2>(C) CONTRIBUTING (optional)</h2> 
 
 <p>To join the <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/" target="_blank"><nobr>github project<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/"></nobr></a>, 
 please send email to one of the following individuals.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Jared Davis (<span class="v">jared.c.davis@gmail.com</span>)</li> 
 
 <li>David Rager (<span class="v">ragerdl@gmail.com</span>)</li> 
 
 <li>Sol Swords (<span class="v">sswords@gmail.com</span>)</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>After you have joined the project, you can proceed as follows when you are 
 ready to contribute.</p> 
 
 <h3>Change and Test</h3> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li>Update as in (B) above: 
 
 <pre class="code">git fetch --all
git merge remotes/origin/master</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Build an executable. 
 
 <pre class="code">(time nice make LISP=&lt;your_lisp&gt;) &gt;&amp; make.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Make book changes.  If you are creating any new books, tell git that you 
 intend to add them (but the repository on the web won't change until the last 
 step below is executed). 
 
 <pre class="code">git add file1 file2 ...</pre> 
 
 Also, consider adding some high-level information about your changes to the 
 Community Books' release notes â€” i.e., the appropriate <a href="ACL2____RELEASE-NOTES-BOOKS.html">release-notes-books</a> XDOC topic in <span class="v">books/doc/relnotes.lisp</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>Run a regression. 
 
 <pre class="code">(time nice make -j 8 regression-fresh) &gt;&amp; make-regression.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>Look for failures, as indicated by <span class="v">**</span> in the log. 
 
 <pre class="code">fgrep -a '**' make-regression.log</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>If there were failures, then go back to Step 1 above to make appropriate 
 changes and re-test, but you can replace the '<span class="v">make</span>' step by replacing 
 <span class="v">regression-fresh</span> with <span class="v">regression</span>, since '<span class="v">make</span>' is clever enough 
 to avoid recertifying more than is necessary.  For example: 
 
 <pre class="code">(time nice make -j 8 regression) &gt;&amp; make-regression-finish-1.log</pre> 
 
 Note that the <span class="v">-j 8</span> option specifies the use of 8 hardware threads; feel 
 free to omit it or use a more suitable number (especially if your computer has 
 other than 8 hardware threads).</li> 
 
 </ol> 
 
 <h3>Update, and Iterate If Necessary</h3> 
 
 <p>Update again as in (B) above:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">git fetch --all
git merge remotes/origin/master</pre> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>The merge may fail if there have been remote updates, that is updates in 
 the repository on the web.  In that case, commit your changes locally and then 
 try the merge again.  You might want to use the <span class="v">-F</span> option instead of 
 <span class="v">-m</span>; see the next section for more on those options.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">git commit -a -m '&lt;some message, with descriptive first line&gt;'
git merge remotes/origin/master</pre> 
 
 <p>If the second command prompts you for a message, the empty message should 
 suffice as a reasonable default.  (In emacs, if vi tries to come up, just type 
 <span class="v">:q</span> and <span class="v">&lt;RETURN&gt;</span>.</p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>You can now go on to the next step (Contribute Your Changes).  But ideally: 
 If the output indicates that anything has changed, then go back to ``Change 
 and Test'' above.  Of course, you can skip the build if no ACL2 sources have 
 changed, and you can skip making book changes if you are still happy with your 
 changes.</p> 
 
 <h3>Contribute Your Changes</h3> 
 
 <p>The following commands will update the github repository on the web.  The 
 <span class="v">-m ...</span> option is a log message whose first line should be a summary of 
 your changes and other lines may give more details.  You are welcome to 
 replace the <span class="v">-m ...</span> option by <span class="v">-F &lt;filename&gt;</span>, where <span class="v">&lt;filename&gt;</span> is 
 the name of a file that contains your log message.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">git commit -a -m '&lt;some message, with descriptive first line&gt;'
git push origin testing</pre>
</body>
