<p>Recognize well-formed event forms.</p><p>Here we formalize some constraints on untranslated event forms. 
      Because of macros it is almost impossible 
      to put constraints on event forms. 
      For example, with an appropriate <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a></span> of <span class="v">barf</span>, 
      this could be a form <span class="v">(barf (1 . 2))</span>. 
      But even macros have to be symbols and take a true list of args. 
      So we know that much at the top but all bets are off after that.</p> 
   <p>The most rigorous test would translate the alleged form, 
      but that would require state 
      and the specification of translate's many options 
      like whether stobjs are treated specially. 
      Until we need it, 
      we are not going to try to formalize the stronger test.</p>
