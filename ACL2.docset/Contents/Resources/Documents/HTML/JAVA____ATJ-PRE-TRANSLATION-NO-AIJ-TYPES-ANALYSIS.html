<p>Pre-translation step performed by ATJ: 
          analysis for the <span class="v">:no-aij-types</span> option.</p><p>If the <span class="v">:no-aij-types</span> input is <span class="v">t</span>, 
     the ACL2 code translated to Java must satisfy a number of requirements, 
     described in the user documentation. 
     These requirements must be checked after 
     the pre-translation steps that may remove code, 
     because the requirements only need to hold for 
     ACL2 code that is actually translated to Java. 
     Performing these checks earlier would reject ACL2 code 
     that would be translated to Java code 
     that does not use any AIJ types.</p><p>We perform these checks after 
     <a href="JAVA____ATJ-PRE-TRANSLATION-MULTIPLE-VALUES.html">atj-pre-translation-multiple-values</a>, 
     so that we can more easily identify translated calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span>.</p><p>We perform these checks before 
     <a href="JAVA____ATJ-PRE-TRANSLATION-TYPE-ANNOTATION.html">atj-pre-translation-type-annotation</a>, 
     so that we can perform the checks 
     without worrying about the type conversion functions and type annotations, 
     which would make the checks more complicated to perform.</p>
