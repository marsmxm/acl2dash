<p>Tracing functions in ACL2</p><p>ACL2 provides a trace utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span>, with corresponding 
 reverse operation <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNTRACE_42.html">untrace$</a></span>.  These can be used without any dependence 
 on the underlying Lisp utility, and are the tracing utilities of choice in 
 ACL2; see <a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a> and see <a href="ACL2____UNTRACE_42.html">untrace$</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>However, for advanced users we note that the underlying host Lisp may also 
 provide a trace utility, <span class="v">trace</span>, and corresponding <span class="v">untrace</span>. 
 Moreover, these have been modified in the case that the host Lisp is GCL, 
 Allegro CL, or CCL (OpenMCL), to provide limited support for <span class="v">:entry</span>, 
 <span class="v">:exit</span>, and perhaps <span class="v">:cond</span> keywords, to hide certain large data 
 structures (world, enabled structure, rewrite constant), and to trace 
 executable-counterparts (see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a>).  See source files 
 <span class="v">*-trace.lisp</span>.  For the above Lisps, you can invoke the original 
 <span class="v">trace</span> and <span class="v">untrace</span> by invoking <span class="v">old-trace</span> and <span class="v">old-untrace</span>, 
 respectively, in raw Lisp rather than in the normal ACL2 loop.</p>
