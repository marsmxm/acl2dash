<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2-PC____REDUCE">Click for ACL2-pc::reduce in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>(atomic macro) 
call the ACL2 theorem prover's simplifier</p><pre class="code">Examples:
reduce -- attempt to prove the current goal without using induction
(reduce ("Subgoal 2" :by foo) ("Subgoal 1" :use bar))
       -- attempt to prove the current goal without using
          induction, with the indicated hints

General Form:
(reduce &amp;rest hints)</pre> 
 
 <p>Attempt to prove the current goal without using induction, using the 
 indicated hints (if any).  A subgoal will be created for each goal that would 
 have been pushed for proof by induction in an ordinary proof.</p> 
 
 <p>Notice that unlike <span class="v">prove</span>, the arguments to <span class="v">reduce</span> are spread out, 
 and are all hints.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Reduce</span> is similar to <span class="v">bash</span> in that neither of these allows 
 induction.  But <span class="v">bash</span> only allows simplification, while <span class="v">reduce</span> allows 
 processes <span class="v">eliminate-destructors</span>, <span class="v">fertilize</span>, <span class="v">generalize</span>, and 
 <span class="v">eliminate-irrelevance</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> Induction will be used to the extent that it is ordered 
 explicitly in the hints.</p>
