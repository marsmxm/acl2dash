<p>Runtime vs. realtime in ACL2 timings</p><p>The ACL2 system provides utilities that deal with elapsed time. 
 The most visible of these is in the time summaries printed when completing 
 evaluation of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  For others, see <a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a>, 
 see <a href="ACL2____READ-RUN-TIME.html">read-run-time</a>, see <a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a>, see <a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER-TAU.html">time-tracker-tau</a>, and see <a href="ACL2____PSTACK.html">pstack</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, these utilities all use an underlying notion of run time 
 provided by the host Common Lisp implementation: specifically, the Common Lisp 
 function <span class="v">get-internal-run-time</span>.  However, Common Lisp also provides the 
 function <span class="v">get-internal-real-time</span>, which returns the real time (wall clock 
 time).  While the latter is specified to measure elapsed time, the former is 
 left to the implementation, which might well only measure time spent in the 
 Lisp process.  Consider the following example, which is a bit arcane but 
 basically sleeps for 2 seconds.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> t) ; to allow sys-call
(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>
 (<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (<a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> "sleep" '("2"))
         (<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> '(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> nil))))</pre> 
 
 <p>A typical time <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> might be as follows, drastically 
 under-reporting the elapsed time.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Time:  0.01 seconds (prove: 0.00, print: 0.00, other: 0.01)</pre> 
 
 <p>However, you can instruct ACL2 to switch to using elapsed time (real time), 
 in summaries and elsewhere, by evaluating the following form.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> get-internal-time-as-realtime t)</pre> 
 
 <p>To return to using runtime:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> get-internal-time-as-realtime nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>While the above example is rather silly, the issue becomes significant in 
 time summaries for proofs that call out to external tools (see <a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> 
 and see <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Note that a function <span class="v">get-internal-time</span> is defined in raw Lisp but is 
 not available inside the ACL2 loop.  However, the expression <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____READ-RUN-TIME.html">read-run-time</a>
 state)</span> provides an interface to this function that is available inside the 
 ACL2 loop; see <a href="ACL2____READ-RUN-TIME.html">read-run-time</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We are open to changing the default to elapsed wall-clock time (realtime), 
 and may do so in future ACL2 releases.</p> 
 
 <p>Implementation note (GCL only): If the host Lisp is Gnu Common Lisp, then 
 <span class="v">get-internal-run-time</span> has a multiple value return, and the first two 
 values (runtime and child runtime) are added together to produce a result for 
 <span class="v">get-internal-time</span>.</p>
