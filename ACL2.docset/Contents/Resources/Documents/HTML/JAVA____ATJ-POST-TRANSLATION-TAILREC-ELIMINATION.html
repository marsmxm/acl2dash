<p>Post-translation step: 
          eliminate tail recursions in favor of loops.</p><p>It is well-known that tail recursions can be turned into loops; 
     this process is often called `tail recursion elimination'. 
     This post-translation step does that, 
     by surrounding the body of a tail-recursive method 
     in a <span class="v">while (true) { ... }</span> loop, 
     and replacing each recursive call with a <span class="v">continue</span> 
     preceded by an assignment to the method's parameters 
     of the values passed to the recursive call.</p><p>We remark that the assignment to the method's parameters 
     is an instance of destructive updates, 
     which is idiomatic in Java.</p><p>It seems better to realize this as a post-translation step, 
     rather than as part of the ACL2-to-Java translation, 
     which is already fairly complicated.</p>
