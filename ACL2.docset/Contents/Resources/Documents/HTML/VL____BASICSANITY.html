<p>Basic sanity checking of various constructs.</p><p>This is a set of basic but rather ad-hoc sanity checks that don't 
really fit into other places.  It is carried out as part of <a href="VL____ANNOTATE.html">annotate</a>. 
Some of the things we do here...</p> 
 
 
<h5>Port sanity checking</h5> 
 
<p>We check that ports satisfy basic well-formedness conditions and agree with 
its port declarations and to issue style warnings for tricky ports.  This is 
meant to identify cases such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module foo (o, a, b);              |   module bar (o, a, b);
  output o;                        |     output o;
  input a;                         |     input c;    // oops, no such port
  // oops, no declaration for b    |     ...
endmodule                          |   endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>This is mostly straightforward.  One complication is that ports can have 
many names internally, for instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module baz (o, a, .foo( {b, c} ), d) ;
  ...
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>So, in general, we need to gather the names from the port expressions. 
While we're at it we may issue various port style warnings.</p> 
 
 
<h5>Port and modport name clashes</h5> 
 
<p>Most name clash checking for real scopes is done by <a href="VL____SHADOWCHECK.html">shadowcheck</a>, but 
things like the external port names for a module, e.g., the <span class="v">a1</span> and <span class="v">a2</span> 
in</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module foo (.a1(b1), .a2(b2)) ;
 ...
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>aren't separate from other scopes, so we check them here.  We similarly 
check the external names listed by modports.</p> 
 
 
<h5>Interface instances</h5> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog 25.3 (page 713) prohibits interfaces from instantiating 
submodules, but interfaces <i>are</i> allowed to instantiate other interfaces. 
Since we can't tell until after parsing whether a particular instance refers to 
a module, interface, or user-defined primitive and use the same representation 
for all of these, we check here that any such instances really do refer to 
interfaces.</p>
