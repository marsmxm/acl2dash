<p>A command-line program for using VL in basic ways.</p><p><a href="ACL2____VL2014.html">vl2014</a> is mainly an ACL2 library, and a lot of its 
functionality and features are available only from within ACL2.  However, to 
make VL more widely approachable, we have bundled up certain pieces of it into 
a command line program, which we call the Kit.</p> 
 
<p>The kit is ordinarily built by running <span class="v">make vl</span> in the <span class="v">acl2/books</span> 
directory.  The source files are found in <span class="v">acl2/books/centaur/vl2014/kit</span> 
but the resulting executable is put into <span class="v">acl2/books/centaur/vl2014/bin</span> 
and is simply named <span class="v">vl</span>.</p> 
 
<p>This <span class="v">vl</span> program is really just a wrapper for several sub-commands:</p>
