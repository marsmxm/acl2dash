<p>A model of C integer conversions for ATC.</p><p>We define ACL2 functions that convert 
     between values of different C integer types. 
     In the ACL2 representation of C code for ATC, 
     these explicit conversions are necessary, 
     because the ACL2 representations of different C integer types 
     are disjoint, i.e. there are no automatic inclusions.</p><p>Conversions between C types are described in [C:6.3]. 
     Here we define conversions among the integer types supported by our model; 
     these conversions are described in [C:6.3.1.3].</p><p>For the case of a conversion to a signed integer 
     that cannot represent the original value, 
     we use a guard that rules out that case. 
     This way, in order to use the conversion, 
     it must be provably the case that 
     the value is representable in the new signed integer type.</p><p>For the case of a conversion to an unsigned integer, 
     we use <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a></span> (via the modular constructor) to make it fit. 
     If the original value fits, the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a></span> has no effect. 
     Otherwise, the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a></span> corresponds to the 
     repeated addition or subtraction described in [C:6.3.1.3].</p>
