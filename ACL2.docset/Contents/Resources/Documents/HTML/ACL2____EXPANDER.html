<p>Routines for simplifying terms.</p><p>NOTE: If you are looking for a simple interface to the ACL2 
rewriter, see <a href="ACL2____REWRITE_42.html">rewrite$</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The routines provided by the expander can be useful in generating 
theorems and simplifying expressions, under given assumptions.</p> 
 
<p>They were developed rather in a hurry and should be used without expecting 
the usual standards of care present in development of ACL2 code.  Once these 
routines are used to generate theorems for you, you should check the theorems 
directly with ACL2.</p>
