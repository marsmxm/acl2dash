<p>Standard fixtypes of unsigned and signed bytes of various sizes, 
          with some accompanying theorems.</p><p>Here `standard' means that these all have uniform structure and naming. 
     They are unary counterparts of 
     <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> n ...)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">signed-byte-p</a> n ...)</span>, 
     for various values of <span class="v">n</span>.</p><p>These are all generated via <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFBYTE.html">defbyte</a></span>.</p><p>If standard (in the sense above) fixtypes 
     of unsigned or signed bytes of a certain size 
     are needed but are not among the ones defined here, 
     they can be added here.</p>
