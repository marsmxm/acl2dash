<p>Functions for looking up and reordering parsed objects by their 
names.</p><p>These are low-level functions that allow you to find parsed 
objects (e.g., variables, modules, parameters) by their names, or to use names 
to rearrange lists of objects.</p> 
 
<div class="box"><p><b>Note</b>: these functions do not have any proper understanding of 
scoping issues.  If you just want to look up a name and see what it refers to, 
you should not use these functions; see <a href="VL____SCOPESTACK.html">scopestack</a> instead.</p></div> 
 
<p>One way to do find elements by name is to naively scan through the list of 
items and retrieve the first one that matches the name.  Our simple lookup 
functions just do this for various types of objects.  For instance, we provide 
functions to "find a portdecl with the following name in this list of 
portdecls."</p> 
 
<p>If many items are going to be looked up from the same list, as is often the 
case, then a faster approach is to construct a fast alist that maps the item 
names to the items themselves, and then use <a href="ACL2____HONS-GET.html">hons-get</a> to do hash table 
lookups.  See <a href="VL____FAST-FINDING-BY-NAME.html">fast-finding-by-name</a> for functions related to constructing 
fast alists binding names to items that can be used for this purpose.</p>
