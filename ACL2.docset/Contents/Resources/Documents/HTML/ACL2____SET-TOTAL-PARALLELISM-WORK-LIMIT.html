<p>For ACL2(p): set thread limit for parallelism primitives</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic relates to the experimental 
 extension of ACL2 supporting parallel execution and proof; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.  While the most common use of the limit described below is in 
 parallel proof (see <a href="ACL2____PARALLEL-PROOF.html">parallel-proof</a>), it also applies to all parallelism 
 primitives (see <a href="ACL2____PARALLEL-PROGRAMMING.html">parallel-programming</a>) except <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SPEC-MV-LET.html">spec-mv-let</a></span> 
 â€” though we expect that rather few programming applications will 
 encounter this limit.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a> :none)     ; disable the limit
(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a> &lt;integer&gt;) ; set limit to &lt;integer&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM-TUTORIAL.html">parallelism-tutorial</a>, Section ``Another Granularity Issue 
 Related to Thread Limitations'', for an explanation of how the host Lisp can 
 run out of threads.  Also see <a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT-ERROR.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit-error</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>If the underlying runtime system (the Operating System, the host Lisp, 
 etc.)  is unable to provide enough threads to finish executing the parallelism 
 work given to it, the runtime system can crash in a very unpleasant manner 
 (ranging from a Lisp error to completely freezing the machine).  To avoid this 
 unpleasantness, ACL2(p) will attempt to avoid creating so much parallelism 
 that the runtime system crashes.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 initially uses a conservative estimate to limit the number of threads. 
 To tell ACL2(p) to use a different limit, call 
 <span class="v">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</span> with the new limit.  For example, if the 
 current default limit is 10,000, then to allow 13,000 threads to exist, issue 
 the following form at the top level.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a> 13000)</pre> 
 
 <p>To disable this limit altogether, evaluate the following form:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-TOTAL-PARALLELISM-WORK-LIMIT.html">set-total-parallelism-work-limit</a> :none)</pre> 
 
 <p>The default value of total-parallelism-work-limit can be found by calling 
 function <span class="v">default-total-parallelism-work-limit</span>.  If the default value is 
 too high for your system please notify the ACL2 maintainers with a limit that 
 does work for your system, as they might then lower the default limit.</p>
