<p>Display time spent during specified evaluation</p><p>The <span class="v">time-tracker</span> macro is a utility for displaying time spent 
 during specified evaluation.  In general, the user provides this 
 specification.  However, ACL2 itself uses this utility for tracking uses of 
 its <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a> reasoning utility (see <a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER-TAU.html">time-tracker-tau</a>).  We 
 discuss that use as an example before discussing the general form for calls of 
 <span class="v">time-tracker</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that by default, the time being tracked is runtime (cpu time); to 
 switch to realtime (elapsed time), see <a href="ACL2____GET-INTERNAL-TIME.html">get-internal-time</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Remark for ACL2(p) users (see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>): <span class="v">time-tracker</span> is 
 merely a no-op in ACL2(p).</p> 
 
 <p>During the development of the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>, we were concerned about 
 the possibility that it would slow down proofs without any indication of how 
 one might avoid the problem.  We wanted a utility that would alert the user in 
 such situations.  However, the tau-system code does not return <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, 
 so we could not track time spent in the state.  We developed the 
 <span class="v">time-tracker</span> utility to track time and print messages, and we did it in a 
 general way so that others can use it in their own code.  Here is an example 
 of such a message that could be printed during a proof.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">TIME-TRACKER-NOTE [:TAU]: Elapsed runtime in tau is 2.58 secs; see
:DOC time-tracker-tau.</pre> 
 
 <p>And here is an example of such a message that could be printed at the end 
 of the proof.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">TIME-TRACKER-NOTE [:TAU]: For the proof above, the total time spent
in the tau system was 20.29 seconds.  See :DOC time-tracker-tau.</pre> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">time-tracker</span> utility tracks computation time spent on behalf of a 
 user-specified ``tag''.  In the case of the tau-system, we chose the tag, 
 <span class="v">:tau</span>.  The first argument of <span class="v">time-tracker</span> is the tag, which in our 
 running example is always <span class="v">:tau</span>.  Note that although all arguments of 
 <span class="v">time-tracker</span> are evaluated, the first argument is typically a keyword and 
 the second is always a keyword, and such arguments evaluate to themselves.</p> 
 
 <p>An ACL2 function invoked at the start of a proof includes approximately the 
 following code.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____PROGN_42.html">progn$</a>
 (<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> :tau :end)
 (<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> :tau :init
               :times '(1 2 3 4 5)
               :interval 5
               :msg "Elapsed runtime in tau is ~st secs; see :DOC ~
                     time-tracker-tau.~|~%")
 ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>The first <span class="v">time-tracker</span> call (above) ends any existing time-tracking 
 for tag <span class="v">:tau</span>.  One might have expected it to be put into code managing 
 the proof <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>, but we decided not to rely on that code being 
 executed, say, in case of an interrupt.  When a given tag is not already being 
 time-tracked, then <span class="v">:end</span> is a no-op (rather than an error).</p> 
 
 <p>The second <span class="v">time-tracker</span> call (above) initiates time-tracking for the 
 tag, <span class="v">:tau</span>.  Moreover, it specifies the effect of the <span class="v">:print?</span> 
 keyword.  Consider the following abbreviated definition from the ACL2 source 
 code.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> tau-clausep-lst-rec (clauses ens wrld ans ttree state calist)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a>
   ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> clauses)
    (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVAPPEND.html">revappend</a> ans nil) ttree calist))
   (t (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a>
       (flg1 ttree1 calist)
       (tau-clausep (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> clauses) ens wrld state calist)
       (<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> :tau :print?)
               (tau-clausep-lst-rec (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> clauses) ...))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Notice that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> :tau :print?)</span> is executed immediately after 
 <span class="v">tau-clausep</span> is called.  The idea is to check whether the total time 
 elapsed inside the tau-system justifies printing a message to the user.  The 
 specification of <span class="v">:times '(1 2 3 4 5)</span> in the <span class="v">:init</span> form above says 
 that a message should be printed after 1 second, after 2 seconds, ..., and 
 after 5 seconds.  Thereafter, the specification of <span class="v">:interval 5</span> in the 
 <span class="v">:init</span> form above says that each time we print, at least 5 additional 
 seconds should have been tracked before <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> :tau :print?)</span> 
 prints again.  Finally, the <span class="v">:msg</span> keyword above specifies just what should 
 be printed.  If it is omitted, then a reasonable default message is printed 
 (as discussed below), but in this case we wanted to print a custom message. 
 The <span class="v">:msg</span> string above is what is printed using formatted printing (see 
 <a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a>), where the character <span class="v">#\t</span> is bound to a string giving a 
 decimal representation with two decimal points of the time tracked so far for 
 tag <span class="v">:tau</span>.  (As our general description below points out, <span class="v">:msg</span> can 
 also be a ``message'' list rather than a string.)</p> 
 
 <p>But when is time actually tracked for <span class="v">:tau</span>?  Consider the following 
 definition from the ACL2 source code.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> tau-clausep-lst (clauses ens wrld ans ttree state calist)
  (<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> :tau :start!)
          (<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a>
           (clauses ttree calist)
           (tau-clausep-lst-rec clauses ens wrld ans ttree state calist)
           (<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> :tau :stop)
                   (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> clauses ttree calist)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The two calls of <span class="v">time-tracker</span> above first start, and then stop, 
 time-tracking for the tag, <span class="v">:tau</span>.  Thus, time is tracked during evaluation 
 of the call of <span class="v">tau-clausep-lst-rec</span>, which is the function (discussed 
 above) that does the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>'s work.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, as noted earlier above, ACL2 may print a time-tracking message for 
 tag <span class="v">:tau</span> at the end of a proof.  The ACL2 function <span class="v">print-summary</span> 
 contains essentially the following code.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> :tau :print?
              :min-time 1
              :msg "For the proof above, the total runtime ~
                    spent in the tau system was ~st seconds.  ~
                    See :DOC time-tracker-tau.~|~%")</pre> 
 
 <p>The use of <span class="v">:min-time</span> says that we are to ignore the <span class="v">:times</span> and 
 <span class="v">:interval</span> established by the <span class="v">:init</span> call described above, and 
 instead, print a message if and only if at least 1 second (since 1 is the 
 value of keyword <span class="v">:min-time</span>) has been tracked for tag <span class="v">:tau</span>. 
 Formatted printing (see <a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a>) is used for the value of <span class="v">:msg</span>, where 
 the character <span class="v">#\t</span> is bound to a decimal string representation of the 
 time in seconds, as described above.</p> 
 
 <p>The example above covers all legal values for the second argument of 
 <span class="v">time-tracker</span> and discusses all the additional legal keyword arguments. 
 We conclude with a precise discussion of all arguments.  Note that all 
 arguments are evaluated; thus when we refer to an argument, we are discussing 
 the value of that argument.  All times discussed are runtimes, i.e., cpu 
 times, unless that default is changed; see <a href="ACL2____GET-INTERNAL-TIME.html">get-internal-time</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General forms:

(<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> t)        ; enable time-tracking (<a href="ACL2____DEFAULT.html">default</a>)

(<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> nil)      ; disable time-tracking

(<a href="ACL2____TIME-TRACKER.html">time-tracker</a> tag       ; a symbol other than t or nil
              option    ; :init, :end, :start, :start!, :stop, or :print?
              ;; keyword arguments:
              :times    ; non-nil if and only if option is :init
              :interval ; may only be non-nil with :init option
              :min-time ; may only be non-nil with :print? option
              :msg      ; may only be non-nil with :init and :print? options</pre> 
 
 <p>Time-tracking is enabled by default.  If the first argument is <span class="v">t</span> or 
 <span class="v">nil</span>, then no other arguments are permitted and time-tracking is enabled 
 or disabled, respectively.  When time-tracking is disabled, nothing below 
 takes place.  Thus we assume time-tracking is enabled for the remainder of 
 this discussion.  We also assume below that the first argument is neither 
 <span class="v">t</span> nor <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We introduce some basic notions about time-tracking.  A given tag, such as 
 <span class="v">:tau</span> in the example above, might or might not currently be ``tracked'': 
 <span class="v">:init</span> causes the specified tag to be tracked, while <span class="v">:end</span> causes the 
 specified tag not to be tracked.  If the tag is being tracked, the tag might 
 or might not be ``active'': <span class="v">:start</span> and <span class="v">:start!</span> cause the tag to be 
 in an active state, while <span class="v">:stop</span> causes the tag not to be active.  Note 
 that only tracked tags can be in an active or inactive state.  For a tag that 
 is being tracked, the ``accumulated time'' is the total time spent in an 
 active state since the time that the tag most recently started being tracked, 
 and the ``checkpoint list'' is a non-empty list of rational numbers specifying 
 when printing may take place, as described below.</p> 
 
 <p>We now consider each legal value for the second argument, or ``option'', 
 for a call of <span class="v">time-tracker</span> on a given tag.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Init</span> specifies that the tag is to be tracked.  It also establishes 
 defaults for the operation of <span class="v">:print?</span>, as described below, using the 
 <span class="v">:times</span>, <span class="v">:interval</span>, and <span class="v">:msg</span> keywords.  Of these three, only 
 <span class="v">:times</span> is required, and its value must be a non-empty list of rational 
 numbers specifying the initial checkpoint list for the tag.  It is an error to 
 specify <span class="v">:init</span> if the tag is already being tracked.  (So if you don't care 
 whether or not the tag is already being tracked and you want to initiate 
 tracking for that tag, use <span class="v">:end</span> first.)</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:End</span> specifies that if the tag is being tracked, then it should stop 
 being tracked.  If the tag is not being tracked, then <span class="v">:end</span> has no 
 effect.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Start</span> specifies that the tag is to be active.  It is an error to 
 specify <span class="v">:start</span> if the tag is not being tracked or is already active.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Start!</span> has the same effect as <span class="v">:start</span>, except that it does not 
 cause an error when the tag is already active.  In effect, <span class="v">:start!</span> first 
 invokes <span class="v">:stop</span> if the tag is already active, and then invokes 
 <span class="v">start</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Stop</span> specifies that the tag is to stop being active.  It is an error 
 to specify <span class="v">:stop</span> if the tag is not being tracked or is not active.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Print?</span> specifies that if the tag is being tracked (not necessarily 
 active), then a message should be printed if a suitable condition is met.  The 
 nature of that message and that condition depend on the keyword options 
 supplied with <span class="v">:print?</span> as well as those supplied with the <span class="v">:init</span> 
 option that most recently initiated tracking.  <span class="v">:Print?</span> has no effect if 
 the tag is not being tracked, except that if certain keyword values are 
 checked if supplied with <span class="v">:print?</span>: <span class="v">:min-time</span> must be a rational 
 number or <span class="v">nil</span>, and <span class="v">:msg</span> must be either a string, a true-list whose 
 <span class="v">car</span> is a string, or <span class="v">nil</span>.  The remainder of this documentation 
 describes the <span class="v">:print?</span> option in detail under the assumption that the tag 
 is being tracked: first, giving the conditions under which it causes a message 
 to be printed, and second, explaining what is printed.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">:print?</span> is supplied a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value of <span class="v">:min-time</span>, that 
 value must be a rational number, in which case a message is printed if the 
 accumulated time for the tag is at least that value.  Otherwise a message is 
 printed if the accumulated time is greater than or equal to the <span class="v">car</span> of 
 the checkpoint list for the tag.  In that case, the tracking state for the tag 
 is updated in the following two ways.  First, the checkpoint list is scanned 
 from the front and as long as the accumulated time is greater than or equal to 
 the <span class="v">car</span> of the remaining checkpoint list, that <span class="v">car</span> is popped off the 
 checkpoint list.  Second, if the checkpoint list has been completely emptied 
 and a non-<span class="v">nil</span> <span class="v">:interval</span> was supplied when tracking was most recently 
 initiated with the <span class="v">:init</span> option, then the checkpoint list is set to 
 contain a single element, namely the sum of the accumulated time with that 
 value of <span class="v">:interval</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, suppose the above criteria are met, so that <span class="v">:print?</span> results 
 in printing of a message.  We describe below the message, <span class="v">msg</span>, that is 
 printed.  Here is how it is printed (see <a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a>), where 
 <span class="v">seconds-as-decimal-string</span> is a string denoting the number of seconds of 
 accumulated time for the tag, with two digits after the decimal point.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a> "TIME-TRACKER-NOTE [~x0]: ~@1~|"
     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #0 tag)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #1 msg)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #t seconds-as-decimal-string))
     (<a href="ACL2____PROOFS-CO.html">proofs-co</a> state) state nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>The value of <span class="v">msg</span> is the value of the <span class="v">:msg</span> keyword supplied with 
 <span class="v">:print?</span>, if non-<span class="v">nil</span>; else, the value of <span class="v">:msg</span> supplied when most 
 recently initialization with the <span class="v">:init</span> option, if non-<span class="v">nil</span>; and 
 otherwise, the string <span class="v">"~st s"</span> (the final ``s'' abbreviating the word 
 ``seconds'').  It is convenient to supply <span class="v">:msg</span> as a call <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MSG.html">msg</a> str
 arg-0 arg-1 ... arg-k)</span>, where <span class="v">str</span> is a string and each <span class="v">arg-i</span> is 
 the value to be associated with <span class="v">#\i</span> upon formatted printing (as with 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span>) of the string <span class="v">str</span>.</p>
