<p>The error handling strategy used by <a href="VL2014____VL-SIMPLIFY.html">vl-simplify</a>.</p><p>As described in <a href="VL2014____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a>, our <a href="VL2014____TRANSFORMS.html">transforms</a> can 
sometimes run into severe problems, e.g., we might run into an instance of an 
undefined module.  In this case, the transform should typically extend the 
module with a fatal warning.</p> 
 
<p>In the context of <a href="VL2014____VL-SIMPLIFY.html">vl-simplify</a>, we generally want to throw away any 
design elements (e.g., modules, packages, etc.) that have fatal errors, so that 
we only produce a formal model of whatever part of the design is well-formed 
and supported.</p> 
 
<p>For various reasons, it's a good idea to throw away any these bad parts of 
the design as early as possible.  The main reason for this is that it easier to 
identify the root cause of the problem.  Problems tend to snowball.  It's much 
better to see a single fatal error from the first transform that hit a problem 
than to see dozens errors from different transforms that all have the same 
underlying cause.  Throwing out modules early also helps to improve performance 
by cutting down the design; there's no point in further transforming stuff 
we're going to throw away, anyway.</p> 
 
<p>On the other hand, we can't really just throw bad parts of the design away. 
We at least need some way to see what went wrong, so that we can debug it.</p> 
 
<p>Our basic strategy for dealing with this, in <a href="VL2014____VL-SIMPLIFY.html">vl-simplify</a> at least, is 
to imagine two designs, <b>good</b> and <b>bad</b>.  Initially, we put all of 
the design elements into the good design, and the bad design is empty.  We 
always only try to transform the good design, and afterward we can move any 
design elements that had errors into the bad design.</p> 
 
<p>Moving things into the bad design is tricky because design elements do not 
exist in isolation.  When, for instance, some module M has an error, we would 
ideally like to remove not only M but also all modules that transitively depend 
on M.  Moreover, we also want to make sure that any modules that are killed off 
in this transitive way get extended with some kind of warning that explains why 
the module is being removed.</p> 
 
<p>Because this is so complicated, we bundle up the process into a function, 
<a href="VL2014____VL-DESIGN-PROPAGATE-ERRORS.html">vl-design-propagate-errors</a>, which is intended to move any design 
elements that (transitively) have errors from <span class="v">good</span> to <span class="v">bad</span>.</p>
