<p>How Long Does It Take to Become an Effective User?</p><p><a href="ACL2____Other_02Requirements.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/flying.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>We expect that a talented undergraduate majoring in computer science (or 
 perhaps mathematics) will probably take several weeks to become an effective 
 ACL2 user.  The time will depend, of course, on that student's familiarity 
 with logic (or formal methods) and Lisp programming, as well as willingness to 
 read and study the ACL2 User's Manual.</p> 
 
 <p>Of course, it is critical to do some projects in order to gain proficiency. 
 (Hence access to an ACL2 implementation is also a requirement, for example by 
 downloading and installing following links from the ACL2 home page.)  But it 
 is critical to start with ``toy'' projects before tackling a ``grand 
 challenge.''</p>
