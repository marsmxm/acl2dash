<p>To shorten many prettyprinted clauses</p><p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so 
 recorded.  Moreover, its effect is to set the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, and 
 hence its effect is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to the book or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form 
 containing it; see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When this flag is set to <span class="v">t</span>, subterms that occur more than once in a 
 clause are abstracted away with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>, generally shortening the 
 displayed size of the clauses.  This flag only affects how clauses are 
 printed.  It does not change what terms the theorem prover manipulates.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:set-let*-abstractionp t ;;; or, (<a href="ACL2____SET-LET_A2-ABSTRACTIONP.html">set-let*-abstractionp</a> t)</pre> 
 
 <p>will cause the prettyprinter to do ``let* abstraction'' on clauses before 
 they are printed.  The algorithm finds the maximal multiply-occurring subterm 
 and extracts it, binding it to some new variable and replacing its occurrences 
 by that variable.  This produces a <span class="v">let*</span> form.  This process is iterated 
 until no subterm occurs more than once.  This process generally takes a little 
 time, but less time than to print large clauses.  The process can greatly 
 reduce the amount of text produced by the prover.</p> 
 
 <p>THIS ONLY AFFECTS HOW THE CLAUSES ARE PRINTED!  The unabstracted clauses 
 are manipulated by the theorem prover.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:set-let*-abstractionp nil</pre> 
 
 <p>restores normal clause printing.</p> 
 
 <p>The mode is stored in the defaults table, See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>. 
 Thus, the mode may be set locally in books.</p>
