<p>A controlled boot-strap theory.</p><p>We begin with the theory at 'IHS-THEORIES (see :DOC IHS-THEORIES), 
and remove all of the :DEFINITION and :REWRITE rules.  To this theory we add 
back in the theories BUILT-INS, MEASURES, and the following 3 names: CAR-CONS, 
CDR-CONS, and CAR-CDR-ELIM.  This theory provides a controlled base for 
devloping books.  Note that this theory is of limited use without some simple 
theory of arithmetic such as the theory ALGEBRA from the book 
"math-lemmas".</p> 
 
<p>The key point of BASIC-BOOT-STRAP is to eliminate recursive definitions, and 
all of the random :REWRITE rules contained in the ACL2 boot-strap theory, while 
maintaining :EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART and :TYPE-PRESCRIPTION rules.  Of course, 
many useful non-recursive definitions and useful lemmas have also been 
disabled, but other theories should take care of ENABLEing those as the need 
arises.</p>
