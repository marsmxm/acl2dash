<p>Check for <span class="v">?:</span>-expressions with strange conditions.</p><p>This is a heuristic for generating warnings.  We look for things 
like the following,targeting the <span class="v">?:</span> operator as well as 
<span class="v">if</span> statements.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">if A { ... }
else if B { ... }
else if A { ... }   // already checked A above, so this is unreachable
else if C { ... }
else ...</pre> 
 
<p>And also things like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">if A { ... }
else if B { ... }
else if !A { ... }   // already checked A above, so this is just true
else if C { ... }
else ...</pre> 
 
<p>And for <span class="v">if (constant) {...}</span>.</p> 
 
<p>All of this could be adapted to <span class="v">if</span> statements too, but we target the 
<span class="v">?:</span> operator because we care a lot less about procedural code (like test 
benches) than we do about the actual hardware modules.  Note that the <a href="VL____QMARKSIZE-CHECK.html">qmarksize-check</a> can also be used for some additional checking on <span class="v">?:</span> 
operators, but it tries to identify a different class of problems.</p> 
 
<p>Since this is just a heuristic and it is completely unrelated to soundness, 
we feel justified in doing a couple of seemingly unsound things.  In 
particular, we basically ignore widths of test expressions and treat <span class="v">!</span> 
and <span class="v">~</span> as equivalent.  We also treat <span class="v">^</span> as <span class="v">!=</span> and <span class="v">~^</span> as 
<span class="v">==</span>.  This is completely wrong in general, but it makes sense if you assume 
that the tests are all going to be one-bit wide.</p> 
 
<p>This check has no prerequisites and can in principle be run at any time. 
But it is probably best to run it very early before throwing things out, and it 
should probably be run before any transform that might alter 
expressions.  (Historically it was important to run it before, e.g., <a href="VL2014____OPREWRITE.html">vl2014::oprewrite</a>, but now we generally are not rewriting expressions like 
that so it may be that we don't need to care much about this anymore.)</p>
