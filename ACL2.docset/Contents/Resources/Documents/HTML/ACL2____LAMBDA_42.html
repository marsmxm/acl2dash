<p>Lambda object constructor for use with <span class="v">apply$</span></p><p><span class="v">Lambda$</span> is a built-in ACL2 ``macro'' that allows you to enter 
  well-formed fully-translated quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects in argument positions 
  of ilk <span class="v">:FN</span>.  We urge you to use <span class="v">lambda$</span> instead of trying to type 
  quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects meant for use by <span class="v">apply$</span>.  We explain and 
  document <span class="v">lambda$</span> below.</p> 
 
  <p>Intuitively, a quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object is a quoted constant like</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">'(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">LAMBDA</a> (X) (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> '1 X))</pre> 
 
  <p>e.g., a quoted constant beginning with the symbol <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> and listing 
  some formal variables, possibly some declarations, and a fully translated 
  body satisfying various rules.  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">Apply$</a></span> can handle quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
  objects provided they have the right basic shape and all the listed formals 
  are symbols and the bodies are <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a>.  But it is difficult to type 
  fully translated bodies and, for runtime efficiency, it is important that the 
  quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects satisfy additional (logically unnecessary) 
  well-formedness restrictions allowing faster guard checking and 
  compilation.</p> 
 
  <p>One should strive to always enter ``well-formed <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects.'' 
  The details of well-formedness may be found in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WELL-FORMED-LAMBDA-OBJECTP.html">well-formed-lambda-objectp</a></span> but our hope is that mastering those details is 
  unnecessary because ACL2 provides a built-in ``macro,'' <span class="v">lambda$</span>, for 
  constructing quoted well-formed <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects.  We urge you to use 
  <span class="v">lambda$</span> instead of typing quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects!  That is, write 
  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a> (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 x))</span> instead of <span class="v">'(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">LAMBDA</a> (X) (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">BINARY-+</a> '1 X))</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><span class="v">Lambda$</span> <i>terms may only appear in argument slots of ilk</i> 
  <span class="v">:FN</span>!</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">Examples: 
(lambda$ (x y) (append x (list y))) 
 
(lambda$ (n lst str) 
         (declare (type integer n) 
                  (type string str) 
                  (xargs :guard (and (posp n) 
                                     (true-listp lst) 
                                     (&lt; (- n 1) (length lst))))) 
         (nth (- n 1) lst)) 
 
General Form: 
(lambda$ vars dcl* body) 
</pre> 
 
  <p>where the <span class="v">lambda$</span> expression occurs in an argument position of ilk 
  <span class="v">:FN</span>, <span class="v">vars</span> is a list of distinct variable names, <span class="v">dcl*</span> is zero 
  or more <span class="v">DECLARE</span> forms as described below, and <span class="v">body</span> is a term 
  returning 1 value.  <span class="v">Body</span> must satisfy the same restrictions one would 
  expect in a non-recursive <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> event with the same formals, 
  declarations and body.  In particular, <span class="v">body</span> should contain no free 
  variables other than those listed in <span class="v">vars</span>.  <span class="v">Lambda$</span> always adds a 
  declaration that every formal is ignorable and, hence, we prohibit you from 
  adding <span class="v">ignore</span> or <span class="v">ignorable</span> declarations in the <span class="v">lambda$</span> 
  expression itself.  <span class="v">Lambda$</span> expands to a well-formed quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
  object or else causes a translate-time error.</p> 
 
  <p>The allowed <span class="v">DECLARE</span> forms in <span class="v">lambda$</span> are <span class="v">type</span> and 
  <span class="v">xargs</span>.  Furthermore, the only <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> keywords allowed are 
  <span class="v">:guard</span> and <span class="v">:split-types</span>.  The other <span class="v">XARGS</span> keywords, such as 
  <span class="v">:measure</span>, <span class="v">:hints</span> or <span class="v">:guard-hints</span>, play no role.</p> 
 
  <h3>About Guard Verification of Lambda Objects</h3> 
 
  <p>Quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects, whether produced by hand (don't!) or by 
  <span class="v">lambda$</span> may have guards.  If the <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object is well-formed its 
  guard plays the same role the guard of a defined function symbol plays when 
  the object is <span class="v">apply$</span>d.  If the guard can be verified to imply the guards 
  of the body (which we call <i>guard verification</i>), and if the guard holds 
  of the actuals to which the object is applied (which we call <i>guard 
  checking</i>), a compiled version of the object is run.  Otherwise, depending 
  on how <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span> has been configured, either an error is 
  signalled or the object is interpreted under the axioms defining <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  and <span class="v">ev$</span>.  <span class="v">Apply$</span> caches its investigations into guard 
  verification (but not guard checking) and compilation.  We discuss the cache 
  in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PRINT-CL-CACHE.html">print-cl-cache</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <p>When a guarded quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object is used in a <span class="v">:FN</span> slot of a 
  function definition, its guards are verified as part of the guard 
  verification step of <span class="v">defun</span> or <span class="v">verify-guards</span>.  If that guard 
  verification fails, checkpoints will be printed and you can use 
  <span class="v">:guard-hints</span> or <span class="v">:hints</span> in the <span class="v">defun</span> or <span class="v">verify-guards</span> 
  events to supply the necessary guidance.  When successful, the guard verified 
  <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects in the <span class="v">defun</span> are recorded in the cache.</p> 
 
  <p>But unlike defined function symbols, whose guards may be verified at 
  <span class="v">defun</span>-time or at <span class="v">verify-guards</span>-time, quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> expressions 
  may be introduced without an associated event.  For example, the user may 
  simply type</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(apply$ (lambda$ (x) 
                        (declare (type (satisfies natp) x)) 
                        (* x x)) 
               '(5)) 
</pre> 
 
  <p>giving <span class="v">apply$</span> a <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object never before seen.</p> 
 
  <p>So <span class="v">apply$</span> must be ready to verify the guards of a quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
  object before attempting to apply it.  This is in contrast to what happens 
  when <span class="v">apply$</span> is given a quoted function symbol.  (<span class="v">Apply$</span> can just 
  look up whether a function symbol has been guard verified.)</p> 
 
  <p>To try to verify the guards of a quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> expression, <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  limits itself to tau reasoning (see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-TAU-SYSTEM.html">introduction-to-the-tau-system</a>).  The 
  idea is not to spend too much time making the decision as to whether compiled code 
  can be used or not.  In addition, we don't want top-level evaluation, as shown 
  in the user type-in above, to provoke full-blown theorem proving.</p> 
 
  <p>Interpreting small quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects can be done relatively 
  quickly.  After all, when the interpreter reaches a guard verified function 
  symbol inside the <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> body it runs compiled code.  It's only the body 
  itself that is interpreted.</p> 
 
  <p>But the tau system is pretty weak and so will be unable to verify some 
  non-trivial guard conjectures, which will mean the <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object is 
  interpreted.  If the <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object is very large or is being being used 
  often, e.g., to map over a large object and check some property, you might 
  really want to invest the time to verify its guards.  This can be done with 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span>, which as of Version 8.1 takes <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects and 
  <span class="v">lambda$</span> terms and updates the cache.  E.g.,</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a>
  (<a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a> (x)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">type</a> (satisfies natp) x))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x)))</pre> 
 
  <p>While this functionality is available to you, deciding that you need to 
  use it is problematic.  <span class="v">Apply$</span> prints no warning that it has failed to 
  verify the guards of a <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> object and is running interpreted code. 
  However, the utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PRINT-CL-CACHE.html">print-cl-cache</a></span> provides basic information about the 
  cache and its documentation may help you discover which <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects 
  in use are unverified.</p>
