<p>Representation of Java primitive types and operations for ATJ.</p><p>In order to have ATJ generate Java code 
     that manipulates Java primitive values, 
     we use ACL2 functions that correspond to 
     the Java primitive values and operations: 
     when ATJ encounters these specific ACL2 functions, 
     it translates them to corresponding Java constructs 
     that operate on primitive types; 
     this happens only when <span class="v">:deep</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">t</span>.</p><p>When deriving a Java implementation from a specification, 
     where ATJ is used as the last step of the derivation, 
     the steps just before the last one can refine the ACL2 code 
     to use the aforementioned ACL2 functions, 
     ideally using <a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a> transformations, 
     so that ATJ can produce Java code 
     that operates on primitive values where needed. 
     Such refinement steps could perhaps be somewhat automated, 
     and incorporated into a code generation step that actually encompasses 
     some APT transformation steps 
     before the final ATJ code generation step.</p><p>The natural place for the aforementioned ACL2 functions 
     that correspond to Java primitive values and operations is the <a href="JAVA____LANGUAGE.html">language formalization</a> that is being developed. 
     So ATJ recognizes those functions from the language formalization, 
     and translates them to Java code that manipulates Java primitive values.</p><p>Needless to say, here `primitive' refers to 
     Java primitive types, values, and operations. 
     It has nothing to do with the ACL2 primitive functions.</p>
