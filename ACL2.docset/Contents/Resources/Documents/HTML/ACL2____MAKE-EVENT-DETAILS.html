<p>Details on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> expansion</p><p>The normal user of <span class="v">make-event</span> can probably ignore this 
 section, but we include it for completeness.  We assume that the reader has 
 read and understood the basic documentation for <span class="v">make-event</span> (see <a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>), but we begin below with a summary of expansion.</p> 
 
 <h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
 <p>Here is a summary of how we handle expansion involving <span class="v">make-event</span> 
 forms.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form :check-expansion nil)</span></p> 
 
 <p>This shows the <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> default of <span class="v">nil</span>, and is typical 
 user input.  We compute the expansion <span class="v">exp</span> of <span class="v">form</span>, which is the 
 expansion of the original <span class="v">make-event</span> expression and is evaluated in place 
 of that expression.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form :check-expansion t)</span></p> 
 
 <p>The user presumably wants it checked that the expansion doesn't change in 
 the future, in particular during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  If the expansion of 
 <span class="v">form</span> is <span class="v">exp</span>, then we will evaluate <span class="v">exp</span> to obtain the value as 
 before, but this time we record that the expansion of the original 
 <span class="v">make-event</span> expression is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form :check-expansion exp)</span> 
 rather than simply <span class="v">exp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form :check-expansion exp) ; exp a cons</span></p> 
 
 <p>This is generated for the case that <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, as 
 explained above.  Evaluation is handled as described in that above case, 
 except here we check that the expansion result is the given <span class="v">exp</span>. 
 (Actually, the user is also allowed supply such a form.)  The original 
 <span class="v">make-event</span> expression does not undergo any expansion (intuitively, it 
 expands to itself).</p> 
 
 <p>Now let us take a brief look at how we expand <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> forms.  More details are found further below (see ``Detailed 
 semantics'').</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a> ... (<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form ...) ...)</span></p> 
 
 <p>The expansion is obtained, roughly speaking, by replacing the 
 <span class="v">make-event</span> form by its expansion, <span class="v">exp</span>, except that if 
 <span class="v">:check-expansion exp</span> is supplied explicitly, then no such replacement 
 takes place.</p> 
 
 <p>Expansion for <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> ... (<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form ...) ...)</span> is similar 
 to the case for <span class="v">progn</span>, except that for if the expansion of <span class="v">form</span> is 
 <span class="v">exp</span>, then what is stored is <span class="v">(record-expansion (<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form ...)
 exp)</span>.  Also as for <span class="v">progn</span>, the exception is that when 
 <span class="v">:check-expansion exp</span> is supplied explicitly, no such replacement takes 
 place.  Here, <span class="v">record-expansion</span> is a macro that simply returns its second 
 argument, but is used for checking redundancy of <span class="v">encapsulate</span> forms (see 
 <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-ENCAPSULATE.html">redundant-encapsulate</a>).</p> 
 
 <h3>Detailed semantics</h3> 
 
 <p>In our explanation of the semantics of <span class="v">make-event</span>, we assume 
 familiarity with the notion of ``embedded event form'' (see <a href="ACL2____EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Let's say that the ``actual embedded event form'' corresponding to a given 
 form is the underlying call of an ACL2 event: that is, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>s are 
 dropped when <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is <span class="v">'include-book</span>, and macros are 
 expanded away, thus leaving us with a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span>, a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span>, or 
 an event form (possibly <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>), any of which might have 
 surrounding <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a></span> 
 calls.</p> 
 
 <p>Thus, such an actual embedded event form can be viewed as having the form 
 <span class="v">(rebuild-expansion wrappers base-form)</span> where <span class="v">base-form</span> is a 
 <span class="v">progn</span>, a <span class="v">make-event</span>, or an event form (possibly <span class="v">encapsulate</span>), 
 and <span class="v">wrappers</span> are (as in ACL2 source function <span class="v">destructure-expansion</span>) 
 the result of successively removing the event form from the result of 
 macroexpansion, leaving a sequence of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a>)</span>, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a>)</span>, and 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> ...)</span> forms.  In this case we say that the form 
 ``destructures into'' the indicated <span class="v">wrappers</span> and <span class="v">base-form</span>, and that 
 it can be ``rebuilt from'' those <span class="v">wrappers</span> and <span class="v">base-form</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Elsewhere we define the notion of the ``expansion result'' from an 
 evaluation (see <a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>), and we mention that when expansion 
 concludes, the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and most of the <span class="v">state</span> are 
 restored to their pre-expansion values.  Specifically, after evaluation of the 
 argument of <span class="v">make-event</span> (even if it is aborted), the ACL2 logical world is 
 restored to its pre-evaluation value, as are all state global variables in the 
 list <span class="v">*protected-system-state-globals*</span>.  Thus, assignments to user-defined 
 state globals (see <a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a>) do persist after expansion, since they are 
 not in that list.</p> 
 
 <p>We recursively define the combination of evaluation and expansion of an 
 embedded event form, as follows.  We also simultaneously define the notion of 
 ``expansion takes place,'' which is assumed to propagate upward (in a sense 
 that will be obvious), such that if no expansion takes place, then the 
 expansion of the given form is considered to be itself.  It is useful to keep 
 in mind a goal that we will consider later: Every <span class="v">make-event</span> subterm of 
 an expansion result has a <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> field that is a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span>, 
 where for this purpose <span class="v">make-event</span> is viewed as a macro that returns its 
 <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> field.  (Implementation note: The latest expansion of a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_12.html">progn!</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> is 
 stored in state global <span class="v">'last-make-event-expansion</span>, except that if no 
 expansion has taken place for that form then <span class="v">'last-make-event-expansion</span> 
 has value <span class="v">nil</span>.)</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>If the given form is not an embedded event form, then simply cause a soft 
 error, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val state)</span> where <span class="v">erp</span> is not <span class="v">nil</span>.  Otherwise:</p> 
 
 <p>If the evaluation of the given form does not take place (presumably because 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> events are being skipped), then no expansion takes place. 
 Otherwise:</p> 
 
 <p>Let <span class="v">x</span> be the actual embedded event form corresponding to the given 
 form, which destructures into wrappers <span class="v">W</span> and base-form <span class="v">B</span>.  Then the 
 original form is evaluated by evaluating <span class="v">x</span>, and its expansion is as 
 follows.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">B</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form :check-expansion val)</span>, then expansion 
 takes place if and only if <span class="v">val</span> is not a <span class="v">consp</span> and no error occurs, 
 as now described.  Let <span class="v">R</span> be the expansion result from protected 
 evaluation of <span class="v">form</span>, if there is no error.  <span class="v">R</span> must be an embedded 
 event form, or it is an error.  Then evaluate/expand <span class="v">R</span>, where if <span class="v">val</span> 
 is not <span class="v">nil</span> then state global <span class="v">'ld-skip-proofsp</span> is initialized to 
 <span class="v">nil</span>.  (This initialization is important so that subsequent expansions are 
 checked in a corresponding environment, i.e., where proofs are turned on in 
 both the original and subsequent environments.)  It is an error if this 
 evaluation causes an error.  Otherwise, the evaluation yields a value, which 
 is the result of evaluation of the original <span class="v">make-event</span> expression, as 
 well as an expansion, <span class="v">E_R</span>.  Let <span class="v">E</span> be rebuilt from <span class="v">W</span> and 
 <span class="v">E_R</span>.  The expansion of the original form is <span class="v">E</span> if <span class="v">val</span> is 
 <span class="v">nil</span>, and otherwise is the result of replacing the original form's 
 <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> field with <span class="v">E</span>, with the added requirement that if 
 <span class="v">val</span> is not <span class="v">t</span> (thus, a <span class="v">consp</span>) then <span class="v">E</span> must equal <span class="v">val</span> or 
 else we cause an error.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">B</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a> form1 form2 ...)</span> (and similarly for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_12.html">progn!</a></span>), and at least one <span class="v">formi</span> has an expansion, then the expansion of 
 the original form is obtained by replacing each <span class="v">formi</span> by its expansion 
 and then rebuilding the entire <span class="v">progn</span> call from <span class="v">B</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">B</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> sigs form1 form2 ...)</span>, then after evaluating 
 <span class="v">B</span>, the expansion of the original form is the result of rebuilding from 
 <span class="v">B</span>, with wrappers <span class="v">W</span>, after replacing each <span class="v">formi</span> in <span class="v">B</span> for 
 which expansion takes place by <span class="tt">(record-expansion formi formi')</span>, where 
 <span class="v">formi'</span> is the expansion of <span class="v">formi</span>.  Note that these expansions are 
 determined as the <span class="v">formi</span> are evaluated in sequence (where in the case of 
 <span class="v">encapsulate</span>, this determination occurs only during the first pass). 
 Except, if no expansion takes place for any <span class="v">formi</span>, then the expansion of 
 the original form is itself.</p> 
 
 <p>Otherwise, the expansion of the original form is itself.</p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>Similarly to the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> cases above, book 
 certification causes a book to be replaced by its so-called ``book 
 expansion,'' where each event <span class="v">ev</span> for which expansion took place during 
 the proof pass of certification is replaced by its expansion, but with certain 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> events elided.</p> 
 
 <p>Implementation Note.  The book expansion is actually implemented by way of 
 the <span class="v">:expansion-alist</span> field of its <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>, which associates 
 0-based positions of top-level forms in the book (not including the initial 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></span> form) with their expansions.  Thus, the book's source file 
 is not overwritten; rather, the certificate's expansion-alist is applied when 
 the book is included or compiled.  End of Implementation Note.</p> 
 
 <p>It is straightforward by computational induction to see that for any 
 expansion of an embedded event form, every <span class="v">make-event</span> sub-event has a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span> <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> field.  Here, by ``sub-event'' we mean to 
 expand macros; and we also mean to traverse <span class="v">progn</span> and <span class="v">encapsulate</span> 
 forms as well as <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> fields of <span class="v">make-event</span> forms.  Thus, 
 we will only see <span class="v">make-event</span> forms with <span class="v">consp</span> <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> 
 fields in the course of <span class="v">include-book</span> forms, the second pass of 
 <span class="v">encapsulate</span> forms, and raw Lisp.  This fact guarantees that an event form 
 will always be treated as its original expansion.</p> 
 
 <h3>Notes on ttags</h3> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> for documentation of the notion of ``trust tag'' 
 (``ttag'').  We note here that even if an event <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> tag-name)</span> for 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> <span class="v">tag-name</span> is admitted only during the expansion phase of a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> form, then such expansion will nevertheless still cause 
 <span class="v">tag-name</span> to be recorded in the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> (assuming that the 
 <span class="v">make-event</span> form is admitted).  So in order to certify such a book, a 
 suitable <span class="v">:ttags</span> argument must be supplied; see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 does provide a way to avoid the need for <span class="v">:ttags</span> arguments in such 
 cases.  The idea is to certify a book twice, where the results of 
 <span class="v">make-event</span> expansion are saved from the first call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> and provided to the second call.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-WRITE-ACL2X.html">set-write-ACL2x</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we discuss a very unusual case where certification does not 
 involve trust tags but a subsequent <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> does involve trust 
 tags: a <span class="v">make-event</span> call specifying <span class="v">:check-expansion t</span>, whose 
 expansion generates a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></span> event during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> but 
 not <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>.  Consider the following book.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2")
(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>
 (<a href="ACL2____ER-PROGN.html">er-progn</a>
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> skip-notify-on-defttag) ; non-nil when including a certified book
      (<a href="ACL2____PPROGN.html">pprogn</a>
       (<a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a> "Value of (<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> skip-notify-on-defttag): ~x0~|"
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #0 (<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> skip-notify-on-defttag)))
            *standard-co* state nil)
       (<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
        ()
        (<a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> :foo)
        (<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> "Imagine something bad here!")))
    (<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> nil))
  (<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> '(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> :some-value)))
 :check-expansion t)</pre> 
 
 <p>This book certifies successfully without the need for a <span class="v">:ttags</span> 
 argument for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>.  Indeed, the above book's <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> does not specify <span class="v">:foo</span> as a trust tag associated with the 
 book, because no <span class="v">defttag</span> event was executed during book certification. 
 Unfortunately, if we try to include this book without specifying a value of 
 <span class="v">:ttags</span> that allows <span class="v">:foo</span>, book inclusion will cause executing of the 
 above <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></span>.  If that inclusion happens in the context of certifying 
 some superior book and the appropriate <span class="v">:ttags</span> arguments have not been 
 provided, that certification will fail.</p> 
 
 <h3>Expansion errors and the <span class="v">:ON-BEHALF-OF</span> keyword</h3> 
 
 <p>Consider the case that expansion returns an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a> <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp
 val state)</span>, where <span class="v">erp</span> is not <span class="v">nil</span>.  Then <span class="v">make-event</span> may 
 conclude with an error message, as follows.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>If keyword <span class="v">:ON-BEHALF-OF</span> has value <span class="v">:quiet!</span> then there is no such 
 concluding error message.</li> 
 
 <li>Otherwise, if <span class="v">erp</span> is a string, then the concluding error message is 
 produced by printing <span class="v">erp</span> with the call <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a> soft ctx erp)</span>, where 
 <span class="v">ctx</span> is the context (see <a href="ACL2____CTX.html">ctx</a>).</li> 
 
 <li>Otherwise, if <span class="v">erp</span> is a message (see <a href="ACL2____MSG.html">msg</a>), then the concluding 
 error message is produced by the call <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a> soft ctx "~@0" erp)</span>, where 
 <span class="v">ctx</span> is the context (see <a href="ACL2____CTX.html">ctx</a>).</li> 
 
 <li>Otherwise, if keyword <span class="v">:ON-BEHALF-OF</span> has value <span class="v">:quiet</span> then there 
 is no concluding error message.</li> 
 
 <li>Otherwise, if keyword <span class="v">:ON-BEHALF-OF</span> is not supplied or has value 
 <span class="v">nil</span> — so we are now in the typical case — then the concluding 
 error message is ``Error in MAKE-EVENT from expansion of:'' followed by the 
 form.</li> 
 
 <li>Otherwise, keyword <span class="v">:ON-BEHALF-OF</span> has a value <span class="v">x</span> other than 
 <span class="v">:quiet!</span>, <span class="v">:quiet</span>, or <span class="v">nil</span>, in which case the concluding error 
 message is as just above, except that after ``Error in MAKE-EVENT'' is 
 stated ``on behalf of'' followed by <span class="v">x</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Note that errors generated during expansion are not affected by the cases 
 above; those only control the concluding error message, if any.</p>
