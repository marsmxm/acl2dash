<p>Inspect failed BDD proof attempts</p><p>Attempts to use BDDs (see <a href="ACL2____BDD.html">bdd</a>), using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BDD.html">bdd</a></span> 
 <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>, can fail for various reasons.  Sometimes it is useful to explore 
 such failures.  To do so, one may simply execute the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SHOW-BDD.html">show-bdd</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>inside the ACL2 loop.  The system's response is generally self-explanatory. 
 Perhaps you have already seen <span class="v">show-bdd</span> used in some examples (see <a href="ACL2____BDD-INTRODUCTION.html">bdd-introduction</a> and see <a href="ACL2____IF_A2.html">if*</a>).  Here we give some details about 
 <span class="v">show-bdd</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SHOW-BDD.html">Show-bdd</a>)</span> prints the goal to which the BDD procedure was applied and 
 reports the number of nodes created during the <a href="ACL2____BDD.html">bdd</a> computation, 
 followed by additional information depending on whether or not the computation 
 ran to completion or aborted (for reasons explained elsewhere; see <a href="ACL2____BDD-ALGORITHM.html">bdd-algorithm</a>).  If the computation did abort, a backtrace is printed that 
 should be useful in understanding where the problem lies.  Otherwise, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SHOW-BDD.html">show-bdd</a>)</span> prints out ``falsifying constraints.''  This list of pairs 
 associates <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>s with values and suggests how to construct a binding 
 list for the variables in the conjecture that will falsify the conjecture.  It 
 also prints out the <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> that is the result of simplifying the input 
 <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>.  In each of these cases, parts of the object may be hidden during 
 printing, in order to avoid creating reams of uninteresting output.  If so, 
 the user will be queried about whether he wishes to see the entire object 
 (alist or <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>), which may be quite large.  The following responses are 
 legal:</p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p><span class="v"> w</span> — Walk around the object with a structure 
 editor</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v"> y</span> — Print the object in full</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v"> n</span> — Do not print any more of the object</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Show-bdd</span> actually has four optional arguments, probably rarely used. 
 The general form is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SHOW-BDD.html">show-bdd</a> goal-name goal-ans falsifying-ans term-ans)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">goal-name</span> is the name of the goal on which the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BDD.html">bdd</a></span> 
 hint was used (or, <span class="v">nil</span> if the system should find such a goal), 
 <span class="v">goal-ans</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> if there is to be a query and otherwise is the 
 answer to be used (without a query) for whether to print the input goal in 
 full (<span class="v">t</span> for '<span class="v">y</span>', <span class="v">nil</span> for '<span class="v">n</span>', and <span class="v">:w</span> for '<span class="v">w</span>'), 
 <span class="v">falsifying-ans</span> is the answer to be used in place of the query for whether 
 to print the falsifying constraints in full, and <span class="v">term-ans</span> is the answer 
 to be used in place of the query for whether to print the resulting <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> in full.</p>
