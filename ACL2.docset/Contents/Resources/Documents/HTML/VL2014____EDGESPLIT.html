<p>Split up edge-triggered <span class="v">always</span> blocks that write to multiple 
registers.</p><p>Our goal here is to reduce always blocks that write to several 
different registers.  We only try to support always blocks with:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Edge-triggered sensitivity lists,</li> 
<li>Non-blocking assignments to whole identifiers,</li> 
<li>If/then/else statements,</li> 
<li>Begin/end blocks.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>For instance, a suitable block might be:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
  begin
    q1 &lt;= d1;
    if (reset)
       q2 &lt;= 0;
    else
       q2 &lt;= d2;
  end</pre> 
 
<p>We could split this block up into two always blocks:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
   q1 &lt;= d1;

always @(posedge clk or posedge reset)
   if (reset)
      q2 &lt;= 0;
   else
      q2 &lt;= d2;</pre> 
 
<p>This is just a generally nice simplification that lets us only consider a 
single register at a time.</p> 
 
<p>BOZO we currently allow always blocks to be split up even if the assignments 
have different delays.  This seems okay.  But it would be good to explore this 
more and try to understand whether it's truly reasonable.</p>
