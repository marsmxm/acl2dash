<p>A simple <span class="v">[msb:lsb]</span> style range.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>msb  <a href="VL____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Most significant bit of the range.</dd> 
 
<dt>lsb  <a href="VL____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Least significant bit of the range.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>Ranges are discussed in Section 7.1.5 of the Verilog-2005 
           standard.  Typically a range looks like <span class="v">[msb:lsb]</span>.  This same 
           syntax is used in many places, such as part selects, <span class="v">with</span> 
           expressions in streaming expressions, etc.</p> 
 
           <p>In general, the <span class="v">msb</span> is not required to be greater than 
           <span class="v">lsb</span>, and neither index is required to be zero.  However, for 
           instance, if a wire is declared with a range such as <span class="v">[7:0]</span>, 
           then it should be selected from using ranges such as <span class="v">[3:0]</span> and 
           attempting to select from it using a "backwards" part-select such 
           as <span class="v">[0:3]</span> is an error.</p>

           ranges.</p>
