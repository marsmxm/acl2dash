<p>Utilities to instrument a program run on the model</p><h5>Command Reference</h5> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<p>Utilities to save the x86 state to a log file:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(printing-x86-components 16 x86 state) ;; 16 is the print-base. 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The current state of the general-purpose registers, instruction 
 pointer, and the flags will be stored in a log file, which is called 
 <span class="v">acl2-instrument.log</span> by default.  The log file's name can be 
 changed by the following:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"> (!log-file-name "my-very-own-log-file") </pre> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li>
<p>Utilities to print the x86 state in the ACL2 session (and not log it into a file):</p> 
 
 <p>The current state of the general-purpose registers, instruction 
 pointer, and the flags can be printed on screen by the following:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(printing-x86-to-terminal 16 x86 state) ;; 16 is the print-base. 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The following will print the current values of CF, PF, AF, ZF, SF, 
 and OF flags (i.e., from the <span class="v">rflags</span> field in the x86 
 state):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(printing-flgs x86 state) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The following will interpret its first argument (100 in this 
 example) as an <span class="v">rflags</span> value and print the values of CF, PF, AF, 
 ZF, SF, and OF flags.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(printing-flg-val 100 state) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>To trace memory reads and writes, you can use the following:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">;; Trace rml08 and rml16. 
(trace-read-memory (rml08 rml16)) 
 
;; The following is the same as 
;; (trace-read-memory (rml08 riml08 rml16 riml16 rml32 riml32 rml64 riml64)) 
(trace-all-reads) 
 
;; Trace wml32 and wml64. 
(trace-write-memory (wml32 wml64)) 
 
;; The following is the same as 
;; (trace-write-memory (wml08 wiml08 wml16 wiml16 wml32 wiml32 wml64 wiml64)) 
(trace-all-writes) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>You can send the output of these memory traces to file using the 
 ACL2 utility <a href="ACL2____OPEN-TRACE-FILE.html">open-trace-file</a>.  Note that doing so will also 
 send the output of any other functions that you have traced to the 
 same file.</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>To step the interpreter once (like <span class="v">stepi</span> command of GDB):</p> 
 <pre class="code"> (one_step) </pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">one_step</span> logs the resulting state in the log file, which is 
 called <span class="v">acl2-instrument.log</span> by default, and can be changed via 
 <span class="v">!log-file-name</span>.</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>To execute <span class="v">&lt;n&gt;</span> steps of a program (or less if it halts or an 
 error occurs):</p> 
 <pre class="code"> (big_step <span class="v">&lt;n&gt;</span>) </pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">big_step</span> logs the final state in the log file, which is called 
 <span class="v">acl2-instrument.log</span> by default, and can be changed via 
 <span class="v">!log-file-name</span>.</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 
 <p>To step the interpreter till a halt instruction (#xF4) is 
 encountered or an error occurs or (2^60 - 1) instructions (you will 
 probably never want to execute these many instructions all at once) 
 have been executed (whatever comes first):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"> (log_instr) </pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">log_instr</span> logs the x86 state after <b>every</b> instruction in 
 the log file, which is called <span class="v">acl2-instrument.log</span> by default, and 
 can be changed via <span class="v">!log-file-name</span>. Note that if you are executing 
 a large number of instructions, <span class="v">log_instr</span> might be really slow 
 because of all the file output.</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>To set a breakpoint:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(x86-break '(equal (rip x86) 10)) 
(x86-break '(equal (rgfi *rax* x86) 42)) 
(x86-break '(and (equal (rgfi *rsp* x86) 0) 
                 (equal (rip x86) 12))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Any well-formed ACL2 expression that evaluates to a boolean is a 
 valid breakpoint.  Multiple breakpoints can be set using 
 <span class="v">x86-break</span> repeatedly.</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>See all active breakpoints:</p> 
 <pre class="code"> (show-breakpoints) </pre> 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>To delete all breakpoints:</p> 
 <pre class="code">(delete-all-breakpoints)</pre> 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>To delete some breakpoints:</p> 
 <pre class="code"> (delete-breakpoints '(0 2)) </pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">delete-breakpoints</span> takes a list of the identifiers of the 
 breakpoints, where the identifiers are reported by 
 <span class="v">show-breakpoints</span>.</p> 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>Run the program when breakpoints are set:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"> (x86-debug) </pre> 
 
 <p>Like GDB, <b>the first breakpoint encountered will stop the 
  execution of the program</b>.  Of course, execution can also come to 
  a stop if an error is encountered or if (2^60 - 1) instructions 
  (again, you probably never want to execute these many 
  instructions!) have been executed (whatever comes first).</p> 
 
 <p>To continue execution, see <span class="v">continue-debug</span> below.  Note that 
  <span class="v">x86-debug</span> works only when at least one breakpoint is set.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">x86-debug</span> logs the x86 state after every breakpoint in the log 
 file, which is called <span class="v">acl2-instrument.log</span> by default, and can be 
 changed via <span class="v">!log-file-name</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">x86-debug</span> stops when a breakpoint is reached, the <span class="v">ms</span> 
 field contains <span class="v">BREAKPOINT-REACHED</span>. This can be used to 
 differentiate between executions that stop because of an error or 
 those that stop when a breakpoint is reached.</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
  <p>To continue execution of the program past a breakpoint:</p> 
 <pre class="code"> (continue-debug) </pre> 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">continue-debug</span> will set the contents of <span class="v">MS</span> to 
  nil only if <span class="v">MS</span> contained <span class="v">breakpoint-reached</span>, then it will 
  <i>step one instruction</i>, and then carry on with 
  <span class="v">x86-debug</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Since <span class="v">continue-debug</span> essentially calls <span class="v">x86-debug</span>, it logs 
 the x86 state after every breakpoint in the log file, which is called 
 <span class="v">acl2-instrument.log</span> by default, and can be changed via 
 <span class="v">!log-file-name</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">continue-debug</span> also sets <span class="v">ms</span> to <span class="v">BREAKPOINT-REACHED</span> if 
 it stops at a breakpoint.  <span class="v">ms</span> will be set to a legal halt message 
 when (if) <span class="v">continue-debug</span> finally leads the program to 
 completion.</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>To record the x86 state at a breakpoint and then continue:</p> 
 <pre class="code">(x86-debug!)</pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">x86-debug!</span> logs the x86 state after every breakpoint in the 
 log file and continues execution till a halt or error is encountered 
 or if (2^60 - 1) instructions (Do we need to say again that you 
 might never want to execute these many instructions?) have been 
 executed (whatever comes first).</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 </ul>
