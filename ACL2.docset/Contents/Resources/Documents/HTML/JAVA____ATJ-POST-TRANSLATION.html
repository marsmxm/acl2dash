<p>Post-translation performed by ATJ, as part of code generation.</p><p>As mentioned in <a href="JAVA____ATJ-POST-TRANSLATION.html">here</a>, after translating ACL2 to Java, 
     ATJ performs a Java-to-Java post-translation. 
     Currently, this post-translation consists of the following steps. 
     These steps only apply to the shallow embedding approach.</p><ol>
<li>We fold <span class="v">return</span> statements into <span class="v">if</span> branches. 
      See <a href="JAVA____ATJ-POST-TRANSLATION-FOLD-RETURNS.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>We eliminate tail recursions, replacing them with loops. 
      See <a href="JAVA____ATJ-POST-TRANSLATION-TAILREC-ELIMINATION.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>We lift tests from conditionals to loops. 
      See <a href="JAVA____ATJ-POST-TRANSLATION-LIFT-LOOP-TESTS.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>We eliminate unnecessary <span class="v">continue</span>s from loops. 
      See <a href="JAVA____ATJ-POST-TRANSLATION-REMOVE-CONTINUE.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>We eliminate calls of the Java primitive array writing methods. 
      See <a href="JAVA____ATJ-POST-TRANSLATION-REMOVE-ARRAY-WRITE-CALLS.html">here</a>.</li>
