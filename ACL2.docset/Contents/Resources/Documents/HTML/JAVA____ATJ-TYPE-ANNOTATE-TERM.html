<p>The type annotation procedure involves inferring the types of terms, 
     and wrapping terms with type conversion functions 
     to match certain type requirements.</p><p>The <span class="v">var-types</span> input assigns types to (at least) 
     all the free variables in the term that is being annotated. 
     At the top level (see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPE-ANNOTATE-FORMALS_B2BODY.html">atj-type-annotate-formals+body</a></span>), 
     <span class="v">var-types</span> is initialized with the formal parameters of a function 
     and with its corresponding input types. 
     When we encounter a lambda expression in a term, 
     <span class="v">var-types</span> is updated with an alist that assigns 
     to the formal parameters of the lambda expression 
     the types inferred for the actual arguments of the lambda expression; 
     that is, unlike at the top level, at intermediate levels 
     variables receive the types inferred for their binding terms. 
     Here `updated' means that 
     the new alist is appended before the existing one: 
     recall that, due to the pre-translation step 
     that removes trivial lambda-bound variables, 
     lambda expressions may not be closed at this point; 
     thus, the appending achieves the desired ``overwriting''.</p><p>Even though variables can be annotated by multiple types in general 
     (see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPE-ANNOTATE-VAR.html">atj-type-annotate-var</a></span>), 
     <span class="v">var-types</span> assigns single types to variables. 
     The only variables annotated with lists of two or more types 
     are the <span class="v">mv</span> vars that arise in the translation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> 
     (see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____FTY-CHECK-MV-LET-CALL.html">fty-check-mv-let-call</a></span>). 
     These <span class="v">mv</span> variables are treated specially 
     by the type annotation process, 
     without a need to add them to <span class="v">var-types</span>.</p><p>The <span class="v">required-types?</span> input specifies 
     the type(s) required for the term, if any. 
     This is <span class="v">nil</span> if there are no requirements; 
     it is a singleton list if the term is single-valued; 
     it is a list of two or more types if the term is multi-valued. 
     At the top level (see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPE-ANNOTATE-FORMALS_B2BODY.html">atj-type-annotate-formals+body</a></span>), 
     <span class="v">required-types?</span> consists of the output type(s) of the function 
     (singleton if single-valued, of length two or more if multi-valued): 
     the body of the function must have the output type(s) of the function. 
     The recursive function <span class="v">atj-type-annotate-args</span>, 
     which operates on the arguments of a function call, 
     does not take a list of required types as input.</p><p>The result of annotating a term is not only the annotated term, 
     but also the type(s) of the wrapped term. 
     This is always the same as the required types 
     when there are required types; 
     when there are no required types, 
     the resulting type(s) is/are the one(s) inferred for the term.</p><p>The type inferred for a variable is the one assigned by <span class="v">var-types</span>. 
     (As already mentioned before, 
     the <span class="v">mv</span> variables annotated with two or more types 
     are handled specially; 
     they are never passed to this function directly.) 
     We annotate the variable with its associated type; 
     note that the variable names in <span class="v">var-types</span> 
     do not have type annotations. 
     We wrap the variable with a type conversion function 
     from the inferred type(s) to the required type(s) if supplied, 
     or to the inferred type(s) (i.e. no-op conversion) if not supplied.</p><p>The type inferred for a quoted constant 
     is determined by the value of the quoted constant. 
     We wrap the quoted constant with a type conversion function 
     as discussed above.</p><p>The non-strict function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> is treated specially, 
     because eventually it is translated to a Java <span class="v">if</span>, 
     which assigns either the `then' part or the `else' part 
     to a Java local variable. 
     The type of the Java local variable is 
     (the Java counterpart of) <span class="v">required-types?</span> if supplied: 
     in this case, when <span class="v">required-types?</span> is recursively passed 
     to the second and third argument of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>, 
     both terms will be wrapped so that they have the required type(s). 
     However, if <span class="v">required-types?</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     the recursive annotation of the `then' and `else' subterms 
     may produce different types, 
     and so in this case we re-wrap those terms 
     with the least upper bound of the two types. 
     The case of a term of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> a a b)</span> 
     is treated a little differently, 
     but there is no substantial difference. 
     In the general case of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> a b c)</span> with <span class="v">a</span> different from <span class="v">b</span>, 
     there is never any required type for the test <span class="v">a</span>, 
     because in the Java code it is just used 
     to generate the test of the <span class="v">if</span>; 
     ACL2 should ensure that the test of an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> is single-valued, 
     but we defensively check for that. 
     In all cases, the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> is wrapped with 
     the identify conversion function for the overall type(s), 
     for uniformity and to readily indicate the type 
     of the Java local variable to generate.</p><p>For a lambda expression 
     (other than the kind resulting from an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, 
     whose treatment is described below), 
     the argument terms are annotated without required types. 
     The inferred types are then assigned to the formal parameters 
     when the body of the lambda expression is annotated. 
     We annotate all the formal parameters of the lambda expression; 
     but note that the new <span class="v">var-types</span> has non-annotated variable names. 
     Note that the list of types returned by <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPE-ANNOTATE-ARGS.html">atj-type-annotate-args</a></span> 
     has a different meaning from 
     the one returned by <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPE-ANNOTATE-TERM.html">atj-type-annotate-term</a></span>: 
     while the latter is a single or multiple type for a single term, 
     the latter consists of a single type for each argument 
     (more on this below).</p><p>For a named function call 
     other than <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> 
     (whose treatment is described below) 
     and other than the array creation functions 
     in <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA_____A2ATJ-JPRIMARR-NEW-INIT-FNS_A2.html">*atj-jprimarr-new-init-fns*</a></span> 
     (whose treatment is also described below), 
     the function's types are obtained. 
     We first try annotating the argument terms without required types 
     (as done for a lambda expression as explained above), 
     thus inferring types for the arguments. 
     Then we look for the function types (of the named function) 
     whose input types are wider than or the same as 
     the inferred argument types. 
     If there are some, we select the one whose input types are the least 
     (this always exists because of the closure property 
     checked by <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-OTHER-FUNCTION-TYPE.html">atj-other-function-type</a></span>; 
     see the documentation of that macro and supporting functions for details); 
     we then use the output type(s) of the selected function type 
     as the type(s) inferred for the function call, 
     and wrap it to adapt to the required type(s) for the function call if any. 
     The successful selection of such a function type means that, 
     in the generated Java code, an overloaded method will be called 
     based on the argument types inferred by the Java compiler. 
     If there are no function types satisfying the above condition, 
     we look at the primary function type (which always exists), 
     and its input types become the required ones for the argument terms, 
     while the output type(s) are used to infer the type(s) for the call, 
     which is then wrapped as needed to match the required type(s) if any.</p><p>If we encounter a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span>, 
     which may be introduced by a previous pre-translation step, 
     we allow its arguments to have any types 
     and we regard the call as having the multiple type obtained 
     by putting the argument types into a list. 
     We also collect the required (if present) or inferred (otherwise) types 
     in a list without duplications that is threaded through these functions. 
     This list does not affect the type annotations, 
     but is used by the code generation functions 
     in order to determine which <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> classes must be generated.</p><p>If we encounter a call of 
     an array creation function in <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA_____A2ATJ-JPRIMARR-NEW-INIT-FNS_A2.html">*atj-jprimarr-new-init-fns*</a></span>, 
     and if <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, 
     we ensure that its (only) argument is a translated <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a></span> call, 
     i.e. a (possibly empty) nest of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span>es 
     ending with a quoted <span class="v">nil</span>. 
     If it is not, we stop with an error, 
     which is really a (deep) input validation error. 
     If it is a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a></span> call, we extract its element terms. 
     We type-annotate them, and we ensure that their result types 
     are consistent with the array's component type. 
     If they are not, it is a (deep) input validation error. 
     If everything checks, then we make the annotated arguments 
     directly arguments of the array creation function, 
     which therefore is now treated 
     as a function with a variable number of arguments.</p><p>Before attempting to process lambda expression or named function calls 
     as described above, 
     we first check whether the term is a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>. 
     For this to be the case, 
     not only <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____FTY-CHECK-MV-LET-CALL.html">fty-check-mv-let-call</a></span> must succeed, 
     yielding variables <span class="v">var1</span>, ..., <span class="v">varn</span> 
     and subterms <span class="v">mv-term</span> and <span class="v">body-term</span>, 
     but also the term assigned to the <span class="v">mv</span> variable 
     must have multiple types. 
     If the term is not a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, 
     the term is processed as any other term. 
     If the term is a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, 
     we annotate it by building a term of the form</p><pre class="code">([reqinf&gt;reqinf]
 ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> ([types]mv)
          ([reqinf&gt;reqinf]
           ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> ([type1]var1 ... [typen]varn)
                    ([...&gt;reqinf] body-term))
            ([AV&gt;type1] (<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> ([AI&gt;AI] '0)
                                ([types&gt;types] [types]mv)))
            ...
            ([AV&gt;typen] (<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> ([AI&gt;AI] 'n-1)
                                ([types&gt;types] [types]mv))))))
  ([types&gt;types] mv-term)))</pre><p>where <span class="v">types</span> consists of <span class="v">type1</span>, ..., <span class="v">typen</span>, 
     and where <span class="v">reqinf</span> is <span class="v">required-types?</span> if non-<span class="v">nil</span> 
     or otherwise the types inferred for <span class="v">body-term</span>. 
     This term is systematically annotated in the same way as any other term, 
     so that subsequent pre-processing steps can treat all terms uniformly. 
     The <span class="v">[AV&gt;typei]</span> conversions 
     are consistent with the function type of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span>, 
     so that, as we are adding more direct support for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> in ATJ, 
     the code generation functions can still treat these newly annotated terms 
     as before, i.e. treating multiple values as lists.</p><p>The function <span class="v">atj-type-annotate-mv-let</span> first checks whether the term 
     has the structure of a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>. 
     Then it annotates the term to which the <span class="v">mv</span> variable is bound, 
     inferring a non-empty list of types (i.e. <span class="v">types</span> above) for it: 
     if the list is a singleton, 
     the term is actually not a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, 
     and the function returns a failure, 
     letting <span class="v">atj-type-annotate-term</span> handle the term. 
     Otherwise, after checking that the number of types 
     is consistent with the number of variables 
     (this is never expected to fail), 
     we annotate the body term: 
     we pass the top-level required types (if any), 
     and we update <span class="v">var-types</span> with the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> variables 
     associated to the types for the term to which <span class="v">mv</span> is bound; 
     we do not need to update <span class="v">var-types</span> with <span class="v">mv</span> 
     because <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____FTY-CHECK-MV-LET-CALL.html">fty-check-mv-let-call</a></span> ensures that 
     the variable <span class="v">mv</span> does not occur free in the body term. 
     Note that, in general, some variables bound to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span> calls 
     may have been removed by a previous pre-translation step, 
     the one that removes unused variables (see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____FTY-CHECK-MV-LET-CALL.html">fty-check-mv-let-call</a></span>); 
     thus, in order to extend <span class="v">var-types</span>, 
     we select the types for which there are actually variables.</p><p>In <span class="v">atj-type-annotate-args</span>, we check that 
     the types inferred for each single argument are a singleton. 
     Except for the argument of <span class="v">((<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a>) ...) mv-term)</span> 
     in a translated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, 
     in ACL2 all the arguments of function calls must be single-valued. 
     We do not expect this check to ever fail.</p><p>Note that an annotated term is still a regular term, 
     but it has a certain structure.</p>
