<p>Implementation details of our <a href="STR____PRETTY-PRINTING.html">pretty-printing</a> support.</p><p>My implementation is very much based on ACL2's pretty printer.  The 
pretty printer operates in two linear passes: the first pass builds a data 
structure that tells the second pass how to print.  The basic algorithm dates 
from about 1971 and was used in the earliest Edinburgh Pure Lisp Theorem 
Prover.  It is described in:</p>

number 64.  Department of Computational Logic, School of Artificial 
Intelligence, University of Edinburgh.  1973.</p></div> 
 
<p>Some general principles of pretty-printer are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Print flat whenever possible, unless argument lists of length over (say) 
40; since they become hard to parse.</li> 
 
<li>Atoms and eviscerated things (which print like atoms, e.g., <span class="v">&lt;world&gt;</span>) 
may be printed on a single line.</li> 
 
<li>Parenthesized expressions should not be printed on a line with any other 
argument (unless the whole form fits on the line).</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>For instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">     'GOOD'                            'BAD'

(foo (bar a) b c d)   |            (foo (bar a) b |
                                        c d)      |
(foo a b  |
     c d) |                          ^^ we think it's too easy to
                                        miss 'b' when reading this
(foo (bar a)   |
     b c d)    |</pre>
