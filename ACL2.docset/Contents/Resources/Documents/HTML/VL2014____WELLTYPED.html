<p>Expressions whose sizes and types are sensible.</p><p>We say expressions are well-typed when their signs and widths have 
been computed, and when certain consistency requirements are met.  This is a 
rather elaborate consistency check we use as a basic correctness property of 
our <a href="VL2014____EXPRESSION-SIZING.html">expression-sizing</a> transformation.  It may also be useful in later 
transformations to insist that the you are working with reasonably sane 
expressions.</p> 
 
<p>Every atom in the expression must satisfy <a href="VL2014____VL-ATOM-WELLTYPED-P.html">vl-atom-welltyped-p</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Every nonatom has certain consistency checks that depend upon which operator 
is being applied.  For instance, in an expression like <span class="v">a + b</span>, we require 
that the final width/type of the expression agrees exactly with the final 
widths/types of <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">b</span>.  As another example, we insist that the 
finalwidth/type of <span class="v">&amp;foo</span> is one-bit unsigned, but otherwise we only require 
that the width of <span class="v">foo</span> itself is non-zero.</p>
