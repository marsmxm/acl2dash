<p>Application-level view of the x86 model</p><p>The x86 model can be used in the application-level view 
  when the value of the field <span class="v">app-view</span> is <span class="tt">T</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Some supervisor-level features are neither used nor required for 
the analysis of application software.  In most cases, a application 
cares about the correctness of his application program while assuming 
that services like paging and I/O operations are provided reliably by 
the operating system.  The application-level view of our model attempts 
to provide the same environment to a application for reasoning as is 
provided by an OS for programming.  In this mode, our memory model 
provides the <span class="tt">2^48</span>-byte linear address space specified for 
modern 64-bit Intel machines.</p> 
 
<p>A 64-bit canonical address can be in either of the two 
ranges below:</p> 
 
 <span class="tt">0 to 2^47-1</span> or <span class="tt">2^64-2^47 to 2^64-1</span> 
 
<p>Note that this address space is 2^48 bytes of memory.  So I can use 
the addresses</p> 
<span class="tt">0            to     2^47-1</span> 
<p>to map the first range, and the addresses</p> 
<span class="tt">-2^47        to         -1</span> 
<p>to map the second range.</p> 
 
<span class="tt">0            to     2^47-1       |     0            to     2^47-1</span><br> 
<span class="tt">2^64-2^47    to     2^64-1       |    -2^47         to         -1</span> 
 
<p>The advantage of doing so is that we will avoid bignum creation 
during address computations.</p> 
 
<p>We define some linear memory read and write functions, like <a href="X86ISA____RVM08.html">rvm08</a> and <a href="X86ISA____WVM08.html">wvm08</a>.  These functions are called by the top-level 
functions, like <a href="X86ISA____RML08.html">rml08</a> and <a href="X86ISA____WML08.html">wml08</a> when 
<span class="v">app-view</span> is true.</p> 
 
<p>The guards of the linear memory functions are stricter than those 
of <span class="v">memi</span> and <span class="v">!memi</span>, because the latter allow reading from and 
writing to an address anywhere in the range <span class="tt">0 to 2^52-1</span>, and 
<span class="v">rvm08</span> and <span class="v">wvm08</span> allow reads and writes only to the range 
<span class="tt">0 to 2^48-1</span> of physical memory: they take as argument a signed 48-bit 
integer that represents a canonical address, they convert it to an unsigned 
48-bit integer, and they use that to access the <span class="v">mem</span> field. 
Basically, we're overloading the <span class="v">mem</span> field 
in <span class="v">x86</span> --- when <span class="v">app-view</span> is set, <span class="v">mem</span> 
refers to the linear memory; otherwise, it refers to the physical 
memory.</p>
