<p>Force ACL2 to perform substitution using a stylized <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> hypothesis</p><p><span class="v">Rewrite-equiv</span> is actually the <a href="COMMON-LISP____IDENTITY.html">identity</a> function: 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____REWRITE-EQUIV.html">rewrite-equiv</a> x) = x</span> for all <span class="v">x</span>.  However, a term of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE-EQUIV.html">rewrite-equiv</a> (equiv x y)))</span> appearing in the hypothesis induces 
 ACL2 to aggressively substitute <span class="v">y</span> for <span class="v">x</span> when <span class="v">equiv</span> is an <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation (including <span class="v">equal</span>) and <span class="v">x</span> appears in a context 
 in which <span class="v">equiv</span> is being maintained.</p> 
 
 <p>Equivalence relations appearing in the hypothesis are not generally used by 
 ACL2 to perform substitutions except under special circumstances, such as when 
 one argument is a symbol or a constant or during the fertilization stage of 
 the <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL.html">waterfall</a> process. A stylized <span class="v">rewrite-equiv</span> expression of the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____REWRITE-EQUIV.html">rewrite-equiv</a> (equiv x y)))</span> can be used to override this 
 default behavior.  Care should be taken in using <span class="v">rewrite-equiv</span>, however, 
 because it can easily result in rewrite loops.</p> 
 
 <p>For an example of a <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a> that leverages 
 <span class="v">Rewrite-equiv</span> to induce substitution using equivalence relations 
 appearing in the hypothesis, see <a href="ACL2____REWRITE-EQUIV-HINT.html">rewrite-equiv-hint</a>.</p>
