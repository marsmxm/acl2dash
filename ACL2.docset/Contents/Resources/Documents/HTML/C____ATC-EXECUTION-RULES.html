<p>Execution rules for ATC.</p><p>We collect some rules about the execution of C. 
     Some of these rules are used for the symbolic execution 
     in the proofs generated by ATC. 
     The other rules are used to prove 
     the rules used for the symbolic execution.</p><p>Some of the rules that are used in the symbolic execution 
     rewrite calls of functions used in the deeply embedded dynamic semantics 
     into their shallowly embedded counterparts, 
     under hypothesis on the types of the arguments. 
     For instance, <span class="v">(<a href="C____EXEC-UNARY.html">exec-unary</a> op x)</span> 
     is rewritten to <span class="v">(&lt;op&gt;-&lt;type&gt; x)</span> 
     when <span class="v">op</span> is <span class="v">&lt;op&gt;</span> 
     and <span class="v">x</span> has type <span class="v">&lt;type&gt;</span>. 
     These shallowly embedded counterparts are used 
     in the ACL2 functions from which C code is represented: 
     thus, the rewrite rules serve to turn (the execution of) the C code 
     into the ACL2 terms from which the C code is generated, 
     which is at the core of proving the correctness of the generated C code.</p><p>For recursive ACL2 functions that model C execution 
     (e.g. <span class="tt"><a href="C____EXEC-EXPR-PURE.html">exec-expr-pure</a></span>), 
     we introduce opener rules, 
     which include <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></span> hypotheses requiring that 
     the C abstract syntax being executed is a quoted constant. 
     Some of these opener rules include binding hypotheses, 
     which avoid symbolically executing the same pieces of C abstract syntax 
     multiple times in some situations.</p><p>We collect the rules in lists, 
     each of which serves a particular symbolic execution purpose. 
     Certain rules (proved elsewhere) may appear in multiple lists, 
     when they serve different symbolic execution purposes.</p>
