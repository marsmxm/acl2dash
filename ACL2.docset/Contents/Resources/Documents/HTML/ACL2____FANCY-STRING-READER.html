<p>A friendly syntax for strings literals that have backslashes and 
quotes.</p><p>Examples:</p> 
<pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt; #{"""Hello, World!"""}
"Hello, World!"

ACL2 !&gt; #{"""&lt;img src="hello.png"/&gt;"""}
"&lt;img src=\"hello.png\"/&gt;"

ACL2 !&gt; #{"""C:\ACL2\axioms.lisp"""}
"C:\\ACL2\\axioms.lisp"</pre> 
 
<p>String literals in ACL2 and Common Lisp source code files are usually 
written as text strings within quote marks.  For instance, the 5-character 
string whose contents are <span class="v">Hello</span> is normally written as <span class="v">"Hello"</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Usually this syntax is fine, but things can get tricky when you want to 
write a string whose contents include <span class="v">"</span> marks.  For example, if you 
wanted to write down a string whose contents were:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">&lt;img src="hello.png"/&gt;</pre> 
 
<p>then you would need to escape the quote marks within it using backslash 
characters, e.g., as follows:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">"&lt;img src=\"hello.png\"/&gt;"</pre> 
 
<p>But using <span class="v">\</span> as a special character means we also need a special way to 
write backslashes.  For instance, if we want to write a string literal whose 
contents are:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">C:\ACL2\axioms.lisp</pre> 
 
<p>Then we would need to write something a string literal such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">"C:\\ACL2\\axioms.lisp"</pre> 
 
<p>In certain cases, such as when writing long <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings, 
the extra escaping can be tedious and error-prone.</p> 
 
<p>To simplify this, ACL2 provides an alternate <span class="v">#{"""..."""}</span> syntax 
for string literals.  This syntax has no special characters, so nothing needs 
to be escaped.  The end of the string is recognized by the unusual character 
sequence <span class="v">"""}</span>.</p> 
 
<p>In the rare case that you need to have the sequence <span class="v">"""}</span> in your 
string, you can instead use <span class="v">"""\}</span>.  If you need to have the sequence 
<span class="v">"""\}</span>, you can use <span class="v">"""\\}</span>.  In general, when a substring 
contains three doublequotes followed by 1 or more backslashes and a right 
curlybrace, it just removes one of the backslashes.</p>
