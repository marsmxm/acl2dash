<p>Placeholder topic for testing out HTML entity support in XDOC.</p><p>Here are the entities that XDOC allows:</p> 
 
<p>Normal XML entities:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;amp;</span>   becomes &amp;</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;lt;</span>    becomes &lt;</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;gt;</span>    becomes &gt;</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;quot;</span>  becomes "</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;apos;</span>  becomes '</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Additional entities allowed by XDOC:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;nbsp;</span>  becomes   (this one can be hard to see)</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;mdash;</span> becomes —</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;rarr;</span>  becomes →</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&amp;lsquo;</span> becomes â</li>

<p>Test of `single' and ``double'' smart quoting for legacy topics.</p> 
 
<p>Test of âsingleâ and âdoubleâ smart quoting for 
regular old entities.</p> 
 
<p>Test of <span class="tt">`single' and ``double''</span> quotes in a <span class="v">&lt;tt&gt;</span> tag and in 
a <span class="v">&lt;code&gt;</span> tag:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">`single' and ``double''</pre> 
 
<p>Test of <span class="v"> `single' and ``double'' </span> quotes in inline preprocessor stuff, 
and in preprocessor blocks here:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">`single' and ``double'' quotes !</pre> 
 
<p>Test of primes in math:  foo'  and</p> 
 
<div class="mathfrag"> foo' </div> 
 
<p>That should probably about do it.</p>
