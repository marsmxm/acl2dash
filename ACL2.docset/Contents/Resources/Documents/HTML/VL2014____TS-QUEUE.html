<p>Primitive thread-safe, shared queue.</p><p>Note that when using this queue, there is no way for the producer 
to signal that he is done.  A consequence is that this queue structure should 
only be used when consumers are continually looping and waiting for work to be 
added to the queue.</p> 
 
<p>This is appropriate, for instance, for the client handler threads that 
always wait on the incoming connections queue for a new client to connect, and 
for the loader thread that is always and forever waiting to be told to load new 
models.</p>
