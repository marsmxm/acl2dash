<p>The root of the IHS (Integer Hardware Specification) library hierarchy.</p><p>The <span class="v">ihs-init</span> book is included by every book in the IHS 
hierarchy.  It contains:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Definitions of CLTL functions that should be part of the ACL2 BOOT-STRAP 
theory.  Since ACL2 won't let us redefine any Common Lisp symbol, these 
functions are uniformly named by <span class="v">&lt;CLTL name&gt;$</span>.</li> 
 
<li>Functions that are not defined by CLTL, but that are otherwise candidates 
for the ACL2 boot-strap theory.</li> 
 
<li>Unassigned functions that are general purpose, and will probably find a 
place in another book someday.</li> 
 
<li>Definition of macros, macro helper-functions, and utility functions that 
are used throughout the IHS libraries.  We have no thought of ever verifying 
any of these.  Thus, the guards of certain functions may be just strong enough 
to get the functions admitted.</li>
