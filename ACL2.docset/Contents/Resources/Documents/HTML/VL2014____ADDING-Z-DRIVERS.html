<p>How we ensure every wire is driven.</p><p>The <span class="v">good-esim-modulep</span> well-formedness check requires that 
every wire of a module is driven by some occurrence (or is an input).  But in 
Verilog there is no such requirement, e.g., one can legally write a module like 
this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module does_nothing(out, a, b);
  output out;
  input a;
  input b;
  wire internal;
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Where there aren't any drivers on <span class="v">out</span> or <span class="v">internal</span>.</p> 
 
<p>To correct for this, in our <a href="VL2014____E-CONVERSION.html">e-conversion</a> we look for any output bits 
and also any internal wires that are used as inputs to a submodule but are 
never driven by the preliminary occurrences produced by <a href="VL2014____MODINSTS-TO-EOCCS.html">modinsts-to-eoccs</a>.  For any such bit, we add an explicit <a href="ACL2_____A2ESIM-Z_A2.html">ACL2::*esim-z*</a> 
module to drive it.</p>
