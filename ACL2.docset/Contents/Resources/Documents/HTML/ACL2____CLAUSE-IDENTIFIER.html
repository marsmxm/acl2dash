<p>The internal form of a <a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a></p><p>To each goal-spec, <span class="v">str</span>, there corresponds a clause-identifier 
 produced by <span class="v">(parse-clause-id str)</span>.  For example,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(parse-clause-id "[2]Subgoal *4.5.6/7.8.9'''")</pre> 
 
 <p>returns <span class="v">((2 4 5 6) (7 8 9) . 3)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">string-for-tilde-@-clause-id-phrase</span> inverts 
 <span class="v">parse-clause-id</span> in the sense that given a clause identifier it returns 
 the corresponding goal-spec.</p> 
 
 <p>As noted in the documentation for <a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a>, each clause printed in 
 the theorem prover's proof attempt is identified by a name.  When these names 
 are represented as strings they are called ``goal specs.''  Such strings are 
 used to specify where in the proof attempt a given hint is to be applied.  The 
 function <span class="v">parse-clause-id</span> converts goal-specs into clause identifiers, 
 which are cons-trees containing natural numbers.</p> 
 
 <p>Examples of goal-specs and their corresponding clause identifiers are shown 
 below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">             parse-clause-id
                   --&gt;

"Goal"                       ((0) NIL . 0)
"Subgoal 3.2.1'"             ((0) (3 2 1) . 1)
"[2]Subgoal *4.5.6/7.8.9'''" ((2 4 5 6) (7 8 9) . 3)

                   &lt;--
      string-for-tilde-@-clause-id-phrase</pre> 
 
 <p>The caar of a clause id specifies the forcing round, the cdar specifies the 
 goal being proved by induction, the cadr specifies the particular subgoal, and 
 the cddr is the number of primes in that subgoal.</p> 
 
 <p>Internally, the system maintains clause ids, not goal-specs.  The system 
 prints clause ids in the form shown by goal-specs.  When a goal-spec is used 
 in a hint, it is parsed (before the proof attempt begins) into a clause id. 
 During the proof attempt, the system watches for the clause id and uses the 
 corresponding hint when the id arises.  (Because of the expense of creating 
 and garbage collecting a lot of strings, this design is more efficient than 
 the alternative.)</p>
