<p>Control error vs. warning when <span class="v">:match-free</span> is missing</p><pre class="code">Legal Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-ERROR.html">set-match-free-error</a> nil)
:set-match-free-error nil
(<a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-ERROR.html">set-match-free-error</a> t)
:set-match-free-error t</pre> 
 
 <p>As described elsewhere (see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>), when a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, 
 <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, or <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rule has free variables in its 
 hypotheses, the user can specify whether to try all bindings (``<span class="v">:all</span>'') 
 or just the first (``<span class="v">:once</span>'') when relieving its hypotheses, as a basis 
 for relieving subsequent hypotheses.  This direction of <span class="v">:all</span> or 
 <span class="v">:once</span> is generally provided by specifying either <i>:match-free :once</i> 
 or <i>:match-free :all</i> in the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> of the rule.</p> 
 
 <p>But suppose that neither of these is specified for such a rule.  (Note: 
 <span class="v">set-match-free-error</span> is not relevant for <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules.) 
 Also suppose that <span class="v">set-match-free-default</span> has not specified a default of 
 <span class="v">:once</span> or <span class="v">:all</span> (see <a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-DEFAULT.html">set-match-free-default</a>).  In this case a 
 warning will occur except when in the context of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  If you 
 prefer to see an error in such cases, except in the context of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, execute <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-ERROR.html">set-match-free-error</a> t)</span>.  If there is no error, 
 then a default of <span class="v">:all</span> is used.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: This is NOT an event!  Instead, <span class="v">set-match-free-error</span> sets the 
 state global <span class="v">'match-free-error</span> (see <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> and see <a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a>). 
 Thus, this form cannot be put into a book.  If you are tempted to put it into 
 a book, consider the fact that it really isn't needed there, since the absence 
 of <span class="v">:match-free</span> does not cause an error in the context of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  If you still feel the need for such a 
 form, consider using <span class="v">set-match-free-default</span> to provide a default, at 
 least within the scope of the current book (if any); see <a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-DEFAULT.html">set-match-free-default</a>.</p>
