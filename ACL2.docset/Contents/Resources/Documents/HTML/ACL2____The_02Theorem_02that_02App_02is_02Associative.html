<p>The Theorem that App is Associative</p><p><a href="ACL2____The_02Proof_02of_02the_02Associativity_02of_02App.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/walking.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2!&gt;<b>(defthm associativity-of-app</b> 
        <b>(equal (app (app a b) c)</b> 
               <b>(app a (app b c))))</b> 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The formula above says <span class="v">app</span> is associative.  The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 command instructs ACL2 to prove the formula and to name it 
 <span class="v">associativity-of-app</span>.  Actually, the <span class="v">defthm</span> command also builds the 
 formula into the database as a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 rule, but we won't go into that just yet.</p> 
 
 <p>What we will consider is how the ACL2 theorem prover proves this 
 formula.</p> 
 
 <p>If you proceed you will find the actual output of ACL2 in response to the 
 command above.  Some of the text is highlighted for the purposes of the tour. 
 ACL2 does not highlight its output.</p> 
 
 <p>You will note that we sometimes highlight a single open parenthesis.  This 
 is our way of drawing your attention to the subformula that begins with that 
 parenthesis.  By clicking on the parenthesis you will get an explanation of 
 the subformula or its processing.</p>
