 <p>The theorem prover output sometimes refers to ``simple'' definitions and 
 rewrite rules.  These rules can be used by the preprocessor, which is one of 
 the theorem prover's ``processes'' understood by the <span class="v">:do-not</span> hint; see 
 <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The preprocessor expands certain definitions and uses certain rewrite rules 
 that it considers to be ``fast''.  There are two ways to qualify as fast.  One 
 is to be an ``abbreviation'', where a rewrite rule with no hypotheses or loop 
 stopper is an ``abbreviation'' if the right side contains no more variable 
 occurrences than the left side, and the right side does not call the functions 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span>.  Definitions and rewrite rules can 
 both be abbreviations; the criterion for definitions is similar, except that 
 the definition must not be recursive.  The other way to qualify applies only 
 to a non-recursive definition, and applies when its body is a disjunction or 
 conjunction, according to a perhaps subtle criterion that is intended to avoid 
 case splits.</p>
