<p>Functions and theorems about leftist tree-based heapsort.</p><p>There are three functions related to heapsort, the most important 
 being ltree-sort, which works just like the other sorting functions in the 
 books/sorting contribution, except it uses leftist trees to sort its 
 input. There are a number of theorems provided that prove the heapsort 
 algorithm correct.</p>
