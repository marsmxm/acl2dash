<p>Notion of instance of a second-order function.</p><p>An instance of a second-order function is an ACL2 function 
     introduced via <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFUN-INST.html">defun-inst</a></span>, 
     which replaces function variables that the second-order function depends on 
     with functions with matching arities. 
     This macro specifies the replacement as an 
     <a href="SOFT____FUNCTION-VARIABLE-INSTANTIATION.html">instantiation</a>, 
     which is applied to the body, measure (if recursive), and guard 
     of the second-order function.</p><p>The new function is second-order if it still depends on function variables, 
     otherwise it is first-order. 
     The new function is recursive iff 
     the second-order function that is being instantiated is recursive; 
     in this case, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFUN-INST.html">defun-inst</a></span> generates a termination proof for the new function 
     that uses a <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION.html">functional 
     instance</a> of the 
     <a href="ACL2____TERMINATION-THEOREM.html">termination theorem</a> 
     of the second-order function that is being instantiated.</p><h3>Naming Conventions</h3><p>If the name of the second-order function that is being instantiated 
     follows the naming convention described in <a href="SOFT____SECOND-ORDER-FUNCTIONS.html">second-order-functions</a>, 
     the name of the instance can be obtained 
     by replacing the names of the function variables between square brackets 
     with the names of the replacing functions in the instantiation, 
     as in the examples in the SOFT documentation pages, 
     This conveys the idea of applying the second-order function 
     to the functions that replace the function variables. 
     However, SOFT does not enforce this naming convention.</p>
