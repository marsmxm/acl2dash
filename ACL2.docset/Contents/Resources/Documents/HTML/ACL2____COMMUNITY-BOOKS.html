 <p>The ACL2 <b>Community Books</b> are the canonical set of open-source books 
 for ACL2, developed since the early 1990s by members of the ACL2 community. 
 They include libraries for reasoning in many domains, macro libraries for more 
 quickly writing and documenting code, interfacing tools for connecting ACL2 to 
 other systems, productivity tools for better proof automation and debugging, 
 and specialty libraries for areas like hardware verification.</p>
