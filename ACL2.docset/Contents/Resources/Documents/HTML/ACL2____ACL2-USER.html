<p>A package the ACL2 user may prefer</p><p>This package imports the standard Common Lisp symbols that ACL2 
 supports and also a few symbols from package <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> that are commonly 
 used when interacting with ACL2.  You may prefer to select this as your 
 current package so as to avoid colliding with ACL2 system names.</p> 
 
 <p>This package imports the symbols listed in 
 <span class="v">*common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*</span>, which contains hundreds of 
 CLTL function and macro names including those supported by ACL2 such as <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a></span>.  It also imports the symbols in 
 <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>, which contains a few symbols that are frequently used 
 while interacting with the ACL2 system, such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>.  It imports nothing else.</p> 
 
 <p>Thus, names such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ALISTP.html">alistp</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a></span>, which are defined in the <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> package are not present 
 here.  If you find yourself frequently colliding with names that are defined 
 in <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> you might consider selecting <span class="v">"ACL2-USER"</span> as your 
 current package (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a>).  If you select <span class="v">"ACL2-USER"</span> as 
 the current package, you may then simply type <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a></span> to refer to 
 <span class="v">acl2-user::member-equal</span>, which you may define as you see fit.  Of course, 
 should you desire to refer to the <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> version of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a></span>, you will have to use the <span class="v">"ACL2::"</span> prefix, e.g., 
 <span class="v">acl2::member-equal</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If, while using <span class="v">"ACL2-USER"</span> as the current package, you find that 
 there are symbols from <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> that you wish we had imported into it 
 (because they are frequently used in interaction), please bring those symbols 
 to our attention.  For example, should <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNIVERSAL-THEORY.html">universal-theory</a></span> be imported?  Except for stabilizing on the ``frequently 
 used'' names from <span class="v">"ACL2"</span>, we intend never to define a symbol whose 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> is <span class="v">"ACL2-USER"</span>.</p>
