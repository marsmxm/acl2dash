<p>How to optimize GL's symbolic simulations for faster or 
larger-scale proofs.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Using different <a href="GL____MODES.html">modes</a> to solve the problem.  Some modes vastly 
outperform others on particular problems and it is very easy to switch modes, 
so this is often a good first thing to try when you run into a performance 
problem.</li> 
 
<li>Decomposing difficult problems into easier subgoals.  GL provides some 
support for <a href="GL____CASE-SPLITTING.html">case-splitting</a> hard proofs, and in some cases this kind of 
decomposition can tremendously boost performance.</li> 
 
<li>Using other <a href="GL____OPTIMIZATION.html">optimization</a> techniques to make GL's symbolic execution 
strategy more efficient.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<p>The scope of theorems GL can handle is directly impacted by its symbolic 
execution performance.  It is actually quite easy to customize the way certain 
terms are interpreted, and this can sometimes provide important speedups.</p> 
 
<p>GL's symbolic interpreter operates much like a basic Lisp interpreter.  To 
symbolically interpret a function call, GL first eagerly interprets its 
arguments to obtain symbolic objects for the actuals.  Then GL symbolically 
executes the function in one of three ways:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>As a special case, if the actuals evaluate to concrete objects, then GL may 
be able to stop symbolically executing and just call the actual ACL2 function 
on these arguments.</li> 
 
<li>For primitive ACL2 functions like <a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a>, and 
for some defined functions like <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____ASH.html">ash</a> where performance 
is important, GL uses hand-written functions called <b>symbolic 
counterparts</b> that can operate on symbolic objects.  The advanced GL user 
can write new <a href="GL____CUSTOM-SYMBOLIC-COUNTERPARTS.html">custom-symbolic-counterparts</a> to speed up symbolic 
execution.</li> 
 
<li>Otherwise, GL looks up the definition of the function, and recursively 
interprets its body in a new environment binding the formals to the symbolic 
actuals.  The way a function is written can impact its symbolic execution 
performance; see <a href="GL____REDUNDANT-RECURSION.html">redundant-recursion</a>.  It is easy to instruct GL to use 
more efficient, <a href="GL____PREFERRED-DEFINITIONS.html">preferred-definitions</a> for particular functions.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>GL symbolically executes functions strictly according to the ACL2 logic and 
does not consider guards.  An important consequence is that when <a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a> is 
used, GL's interpreter follows the <span class="v">:logic</span> definition instead of the 
<span class="v">:exec</span> definition, since it might be unsound to use the <span class="v">:exec</span> version 
of a definition without establishing the guard is met.  Also, while GL can 
symbolically simulate functions that take user-defined stobjs or even the ACL2 
<a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, it does not operate on "real" <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">ACL2::stobj</a>s; instead, it 
uses the logical definitions of the relevant stobj operations, which do not 
provide the performance benefits of destructive operations.  Non-executable 
functions cannot be symbolically executed.</p> 
 
<p>In the event that one is performing a very large decomposition proof (e.g., 
the theorem <span class="v">boothmul-decomp-is-boothmul-via-GL</span> in book 
<span class="v">centaur/esim/tutorial/boothmul.lisp</span>, one should consider using book 
<span class="v">centaur/esim/stv/stv-decomp-proofs</span>.</p>
