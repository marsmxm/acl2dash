<p>Java input types generated by ATJ.</p><p>ATJ generates certain Java types from corresponding ACL2 types; 
     these Java types are used for methods' inputs (i.e. parameters).</p><p>ATJ also generates Java types for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a></span> values, 
     but those are only used for methods' outputs (i.e. results). 
     We only consider input types here.</p><p>The Java code generated by ATJ also uses Java types 
     other than the ones mentioned above, 
     but those additional Java types are ``auxiliary'', 
     in the sense that they are not the result of translating ACL2 types. 
     We do not consider these auxiliary types here.</p>
