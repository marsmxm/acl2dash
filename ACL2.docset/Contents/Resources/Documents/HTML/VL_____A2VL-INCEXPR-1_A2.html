<p>The literal <span class="v">1</span> we use when eliminating increment/decrement expressions.</p><p>Context: we are converting real increment/decrement expressions, 
i.e., <span class="v">a++</span>, <span class="v">++a</span>, <span class="v">a--</span>, or <span class="v">--a</span>, into assignments such as <span class="v">a
= a + 1'b1</span> or <span class="v">a = a - 1'b1</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Using <span class="v">1'b1</span> works correctly but sign/sizing deserves some justification. 
If <span class="v">a</span> is unsigned, then the expression <span class="v">a + 1'b1</span> or <span class="v">a - 1'b1</span> are 
clearly fine.  If <span class="v">a</span> is signed, then <span class="v">a + 1'b1</span> or <span class="v">a - 1'b1</span> are 
going to be treated as unsigned additions.  But this is fine since addition and 
subtraction are the same in 2's complement signed or unsigned arithmetic, and 
these are the only operators we're dealing with.</p><p><b>Definition: </b>*vl-incexpr-1*</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a>
