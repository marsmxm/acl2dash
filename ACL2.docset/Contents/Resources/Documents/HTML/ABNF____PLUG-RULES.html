<p>This plugs <span class="v">rules2</span> into <span class="v">rules1</span>, not vice versa. 
     This choice is motivated by the fact that grammar rules 
     are usually presented in a top-down manner, 
     and so it seems more natural to have 
     the ``plugged'' rules (e.g. HTTP) 
     appear before the ``plugging'' rules (e.g. URI).</p><p>After removing from <span class="v">rules1</span> the prose rules 
     whose names have definitions in <span class="v">rules2</span>, 
     we find the rules in <span class="v">rules2</span> that transitively define 
     rule names referenced but not defined 
     in the remaining rules of <span class="v">rules1</span>. 
     We append the rules found after the remaining rules of <span class="v">rules1</span>.</p><p>Thus, prose rules in <span class="v">rules1</span> are effectively replaced 
     by corresponding rules in <span class="v">rules</span> 
     (assuming that each prose rule removed from <span class="v">rules1</span> 
     is the only rule in <span class="v">rules1</span> that defines its rule name). 
     Besides replacing <span class="v">prose-rules</span> like this, 
     the plugging operation may also provide definitions 
     for rule names that are only referenced in <span class="v">rules1</span>.</p><p>Prose rules in <span class="v">rules1</span> 
     whose names do not have definitions in <span class="v">rules2</span> 
     are not removed from <span class="v">rules1</span> and thus appear in the resulting rules. 
     Similarly, rules referenced in <span class="v">rules1</span> 
     but defined neither in <span class="v">rules1</span> nor in <span class="v">rules2</span> 
     remain referenced but not defined in the resulting rules. 
     These features allow multi-step plugging, 
     i.e. <span class="v">rules2</span> is plugged into <span class="v">rules1</span>, 
     then <span class="v">rules3</span> is plugged into the result of the previous operation, 
     and so on.</p>
