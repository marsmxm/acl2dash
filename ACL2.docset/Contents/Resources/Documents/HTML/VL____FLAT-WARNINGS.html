<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=VL____FLAT-WARNINGS">Click for Flat-warnings in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Extract flat lists of warnings from various design elements.</p><p>These functions append together the warnings from, e.g., all 
modules in a module list, to create unified lists of warnings.</p> 
 
<p><b>Note</b>: if you want to summarize or print warnings, a <a href="VL____VL-REPORTCARD-P.html">vl-reportcard-p</a> is typically more useful than a flat list of warnings.</p> 
 
<p><b>Note</b>: these functions don't clean the warnings in any way, and so you 
may end up with many redundant warnings.  Because of this, it is probably a 
good idea to <a href="VL____CLEAN-WARNINGS.html">clean-warnings</a> before flattening.</p>
