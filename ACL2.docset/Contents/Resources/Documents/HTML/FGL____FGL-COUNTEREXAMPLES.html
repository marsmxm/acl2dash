<p>Generating counterexamples from SAT checks in FGL</p><p>When FGL calls a SAT solver and it returns a satisfying assignment, 
what we actually have is an assignment for the Boolean variables associated 
with various symbolic objects in the Boolean variable database.  Often what we 
really want is an assignment to the original variables of the theorem, or to 
certain objects within our local context.  This topic discusses FGL's method of 
deriving a term-level counterexample from a Boolean-level counterexample.</p> 
 
<p>Note that what we are trying to do is not always possible! The underlying 
problem is undecidable, and it depends very much on the set of rules in use 
whether there might be interdependencies among the Boolean variables such that 
the satisfying assignment for the SAT problem can't be realized in terms of the 
theorem variables.  For example, if one Boolean variable is associated with 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> 0 x)</span> and assigned <span class="v">T</span> but another variable is associated with 
<span class="v">(intcar x)</span> and assigned <span class="v">NIL</span>, that assignment can't be realized 
because the two expressions are equal.  This topic as well as <a href="FGL____FGL-GETTING-BITS-FROM-OBJECTS.html">fgl-getting-bits-from-objects</a> offer advice for avoiding these 
interdependencies and ensuring that term-level counterexamples may be easily 
derived from Boolean satisfying assignments.</p> 
 
<p>The input to our computation is essentially an assignment of Boolean values 
to various FGL objects, namely the ones associated with Boolean variables in 
the Boolean variable database.  More specifically, we have the <span class="v">bvar-db</span> 
mapping Boolean variables to FGL objects and an <span class="v">env</span>, the satisfying 
assignment for these Boolean variables; but we can view this as an assignment 
of values to FGL objects instead, since the names of the Boolean variables are 
interchangeable.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Sketch of Algorithm</h3> 
 
<p>We begin with an assignment <span class="v">a</span> of values to FGL objects, derived from the 
<span class="v">bvar-db</span> and <span class="v">env</span>.  We want to extend this assignment so that 
eventually it includes values for all the theorem variables that are 
consistent, i.e. the evaluations of all the objects in <span class="v">a</span> match their 
associated values.</p> 
 
<p>The primary way of extending <span class="v">a</span> with new assignment pairs is to apply 
certain rules that say how we may derive new assignments from existing ones. 
These rules may be added by users.  The following example rules illustrate two 
common types:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FGL____DEF-CTREX-RULE.html">def-ctrex-rule</a> intcar-intcdr-ctrex-elim
  :match ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (intcar x))
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (intcdr x)))
  :match-conds ((cdr-match cdr)
                (car-match car))
  :assign (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> cdr-match cdr (intcdr x)))
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> car-match car (intcar x))))
            (intcons car cdr))
  :assigned-var x
  :ruletype :elim)

(<a href="FGL____DEF-CTREX-RULE.html">def-ctrex-rule</a> assoc-equal-ctrex-rule
  :match ((pair (<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a> k x)))
  :assign (<a href="ACL2____PUT-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">put-assoc-equal</a> k (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> pair) x)
  :assigned-var x
  :ruletype :property)</pre> 
 
<p>The first rule says that if we have an assignment of a value to some object 
matching <span class="v">(intcar x)</span> (that is, a <span class="v">:g-apply</span> FGL object whose function 
symbol is <span class="v">intcar</span>) and an assignment to some other object matching 
<span class="v">(intcdr x)</span> (that is, a <span class="v">:g-apply</span> object whose function symbol is 
<span class="v">intcdr</span> and whose argument is the same as that of the <span class="v">intcar</span> object), 
then we can derive a value for <span class="v">x</span> (the shared argument of the two objects), 
namely the <span class="v">intcons</span> of the two values.  If we only have an assignment to 
one or the other, <span class="v">intcar</span> or <span class="v">intcdr</span>, then the other part is defaulted 
to the <span class="v">intcar/intcdr</span> of any current value tentatively assigned to 
<span class="v">x</span>.</p> 
 
<p>The second rule says that if we have an assignment of a value <span class="v">pair</span> to 
<span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a> k x)</span>, then we can modify <span class="v">x</span> to accomodate that by setting 
it to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PUT-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">put-assoc-equal</a> k (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> pair) x)</span>.  The <span class="v">:property</span> ruletype, as 
distinguished from the <span class="v">:elim</span> ruletype of the previous rule, implies that 
this rule can be applied several times to update the assignment to a term 
<span class="v">x</span>; i.e. we can build up an alist given the values assigned to several 
different keys.</p> 
 
<p>Another method of adding pairs is to copy values on the basis of 
equivalences that are assumed.  That is, if <span class="v">(equiv x y)</span> is assigned <span class="v">T</span> 
and <span class="v">y</span> is assigned some value, then assign <span class="v">x</span> that same value.</p>
