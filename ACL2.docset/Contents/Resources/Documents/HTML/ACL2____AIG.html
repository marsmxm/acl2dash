<p>A <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And-inverter_graph" target="_blank"><nobr>And-Inverter 
Graph<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And-inverter_graph"></nobr></a> (AIG) library for representing and manipulating Boolean functions.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>And-Inverter Graphs are a way to represent Boolean functions using only the 
operations <i>and</i> and <i>not</i>.</p> 
 
<p>This AIG library, found in <span class="v">centaur/aig</span>, is sometimes called the 
<b>Hons-AIG library</b> to distinguish it from another AIG library, <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a>.  Very briefly:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>Hons-AIGs are simpler, easier to work with, and easier to reason about.</li> 
 <li>
<a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> is faster.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>We won't say anything more about Aignet here.  A much more detailed 
comparison of the libraries is available in: Jared Davis and Sol Swords.  <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.114.8" target="_blank"><nobr>Verified AIG Algorithms in 
ACL2.<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://dx.doi.org/10.4204/EPTCS.114.8"></nobr></a> In ACL2 Workshop 2013. May, 2013. EPTCS 114.  Pages 95-110.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Representation of AIGs</h3> 
 
<p>We always construct AIGs with <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a> so that existing pieces of AIGs 
will be automatically reused.  We represent AIGs as arbitrary cons trees, which 
we interpret as follows:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">T</span> represents the constant-true function.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">NIL</span> represents the constant-false function.</li> 
 
<li>Any other atom represents a Boolean variable (i.e., an input to the 
function.)</li> 
 
<li>A cons of the form <span class="v">(A . NIL)</span> represents the negation of <span class="v">A</span>.</li> 
 
<li>Any other cons, <span class="v">(A . B)</span>, represents the conjunction of <span class="v">A</span> and 
<span class="v">B</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Note that every ACL2 object is a well-formed AIG under this definition.</p> 
 
<p>This meaning of cons trees is given by the evaluation function <a href="ACL2____AIG-EVAL.html">aig-eval</a>, which returns the (Boolean) value of an AIG under some particular 
assignment to its variables.  This function naturally induces an equivalence 
relation, <a href="ACL2____AIG-EQUIV.html">aig-equiv</a>: two AIGs are semantically equivalent if they have 
the same evaluation under every possible variable assignment.</p> 
 
<p>You might wonder why we would restrict ourselves to using only <i>and</i> 
and <i>not</i>?  On the surface, using a richer language like S-expressions 
might seem more compact.  For instance, with S-expressions we could represent 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> a b)</span> is much smaller looking than its and/not equivalent: 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> a) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> b)))</span>.</p> 
 
<p>But another critical part of memory efficiency is structure sharing.  That 
is, suppose that we already need <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> a)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> b)</span> elsewhere in the 
function.  With s-expressions, these terms would have nothing in common with 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> a b)</span>, but with AIGs we can reuse the existing parts of 
<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> a) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> b)))</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Library Functions</h3> 
 
<p>Besides the <a href="ACL2____AIG-SEMANTICS.html">aig-semantics</a> functions like <a href="ACL2____AIG-EVAL.html">aig-eval</a> and <a href="ACL2____AIG-EQUIV.html">aig-equiv</a>, the real core of the library includes:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Basic, low-level <a href="ACL2____AIG-CONSTRUCTORS.html">aig-constructors</a> for building 
AIGs (<i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, etc.).  We prove these operations correct with 
respect to <a href="ACL2____AIG-EVAL.html">aig-eval</a>.</li> 
 
<li>Somewhat higher-level <a href="ACL2____AIG-SUBSTITUTION.html">aig-substitution</a> operations, like <a href="ACL2____AIG-RESTRICT.html">aig-restrict</a>, <a href="ACL2____AIG-COMPOSE.html">aig-compose</a>, and <a href="ACL2____AIG-PARTIAL-EVAL.html">aig-partial-eval</a>.</li> 
 
<li>Operations for collecting the variables from an AIG, such as <a href="ACL2____AIG-VARS.html">aig-vars</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>We provide some tools to "solve" AIGs.  Historically we have heavily used 
the <a href="ACL2____BDDIFY.html">bddify</a> algorithm, which constructs a BDD from an AIG.  More 
recently, <a href="ACL2____AIG-SAT.html">aig-sat</a> provides a nice alternative using <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> and 
<a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a> to give the problem to a SAT solver.</p> 
 
<p>Beyond this, the rest of the library is a hodgepodge of <a href="ACL2____AIG-OTHER.html">aig-other</a> 
algorithms for working with AIGs.</p> 
 
 
<h3>AIGs versus BDDs</h3> 
 
<p>Another option for representing Boolean functions would be to use <a href="ACL2____UBDDS.html">BDDs</a>.  In comparison with BDDs, AIGs are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>cheaper to construct, e.g., if we want to <i>or</i> together the functions 
<span class="v">f</span> and <span class="v">g</span>, it only takes a few conses with AIGs, whereas with BDDs we 
need to walk through <span class="v">f</span> and <span class="v">g</span> to construct a new structure (which 
might be quite large); but</li> 
 
<li>more expensive to compare, e.g., with BDDs we can determine if <span class="v">f</span> and 
<span class="v">g</span> are equal via pointer equality, whereas with AIGs this is a 
satisfiability problem.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This tradeoff is often worth it.  For instance, it can often be more faster 
to construct an AIG and then <a href="ACL2____BDDIFY.html">bddify</a> it than to just directly build the 
BDD.  Why?  With the whole AIG visible, the bddify algorithm can often 
"prune" branches of the AIG that turn out to be irrelevant, and hence avoid 
constructing large parts of the BDD that aren't really needed.</p>
