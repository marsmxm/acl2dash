<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____TAU-DATA">Click for Tau-data in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>To see what tau knows about a function symbol</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____TAU-DATA.html">tau-data</a> binary-+)

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____TAU-DATA.html">tau-data</a> fn)</pre> 
 
 <p>This macro returns a list structure that indicates what facts about the 
 symbol <span class="v">fn</span> are known to the tau system.  <span class="v">Fn</span> should either be a 
 function symbol or else a macro associated with <span class="v">fn</span>; see <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>.  See <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-TAU-SYSTEM.html">introduction-to-the-tau-system</a> for 
 background details.</p> 
 
 <p>The list structure should be self-explanatory given the following brief 
 comments.  The ``index'' of a function, when non-<span class="v">nil</span>, means the function 
 is a monadic Boolean function treated by the tau system as a tau 
 predicate.</p> 
 
 <p>The ``positive'' and ``negative implicants'' are conjunctions that indicate 
 the tau implied by the given one or its negation.</p> 
 
 <p>The ``signatures'' entry is a formula indicating all the known signatures. 
 If the signatures formula is <span class="v">T</span> it means there are no known signatures. 
 (Signatures is the conjunction of all signature rules and the empty 
 conjunction is <span class="v">T</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>If you wish to see a long list of all the runes from which some tau 
 information has been gleaned, evaluate <span class="v">(get-tau-runes (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span>.</p>
