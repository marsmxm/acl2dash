<p>How to build the Milawa kernel on your choice of Lisps, and use it to 
check the proofs produced by the bootstrapping process.</p><p>After you have done a <a href="MILAWA____BUILD.html">build</a>, you will have thousands of 
proof files throughout the <span class="v">milawa/Proofs</span> directory.  Here, we explain how 
to create a standalone Milawa proof checker, and use it to check these proofs 
with a Common Lisp implementation.  The instructions for Jitawa are different; 
see <a href="MILAWA____JITAWA-CHECKS.html">jitawa-checks</a>.</p> 
 
<h3>1.  Choose a Lisp Implementation</h3> 
 
<p>You will need to install a Lisp environment to run the proof checker.  Many 
options may work.</p> 
 
<h5>
<a href="http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl" target="_blank"><nobr>CCL<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://trac.clozure.com/openmcl"></nobr></a> -- <b>Recommended</b>, free, high performance</h5> 
 
<p>Instructions:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>After installing ccl, add a symlink named <span class="v">ccl</span> to your $PATH</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Performance note: at the top of <span class="v">milawa.lsp</span>, there are some 
CCL-specific settings which configure the garbage collector to collect after 
every 512 MB.  This seems to be appropriate for a system with up to 4 GB of 
memory.  If your system has considerably more memory than this, increasing this 
threshold may provide better performance.</p> 
 
 
<h5>
<a href="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"><nobr>SBCL<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/"></nobr></a> -- free, multiplatform, good performance</h5> 
 
<p>Instructions:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>After installing, add a symlink named <span class="v">sbcl</span> to your $PATH</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Performance note: at the top of <span class="tt">milawa.lsp</span>, there are some 
SBCL-specific settings which configure the garbage collector to collect after 
every 512 MB.  This seems to be appropriate for a system with up to 4 GB of 
memory.  If your system has considerably more memory than this, increasing this 
threshold may provide better performance.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Other Options</h4> 
 
<p>Other Lisps <b>may or may not still work</b>.  The instructions below are 
probably a good starting point, but I have not tried to use these Lisps to 
check the proofs since my dissertation.</p>

<a href="http://clisp.cons.org/" target="_blank"><nobr>CLISP<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://clisp.cons.org/"></nobr></a> -- free, VERY SLOW</h5> 
 
<p>Instructions:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>After installing, add a symlink named <span class="v">clisp</span> to your $PATH</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Macintosh note: I am unable to use <span class="tt">clisp</span> on a macbook because I 
cannot increase the stack size (e.g., <span class="tt">ulimit -s</span>) beyond 16384.  In my 
successful runs Linux machines, I use a ulimit of 65535.</p>

<a href="http://www.franz.com/products/allegrocl/" target="_blank"><nobr>Allegro<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.franz.com/products/allegrocl/"></nobr></a> -- commercial, fast, NOT KNOWN TO WORK</h5> 
 
<p>Instructions:</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>After installing, add a symlink named <span class="v">acl</span> to your $PATH</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>I only have access to a copy of Allegro on 32-bit linux, and it runs out of 
memory in Level 10 on Nemesis.  I have tried to address this by using Allegro's 
<a href="http://www.allegrocache.org/support/tech_corner/lisp-heap-051508.lhtml" target="_blank"><nobr>build-lisp-image<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.allegrocache.org/support/tech_corner/lisp-heap-051508.lhtml"></nobr></a> 
function to create a copy of Allegro with a larger Lisp heap size, e.g.,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(build-lisp-image "big-acl.dxl"
                  :lisp-heap-start "500M"
                  :c-heap-start "3000M")</pre> 
 
<p>Then, I used <span class="tt">acl -I big-acl.dxl</span> when building the base Milawa program, but this 
is still not successful.  It may be that a more recent version of Allegro or more powerful 
computer will be successful.</p>

<a href="http://www.scieneer.com/scl/" target="_blank"><nobr>Scieneer<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.scieneer.com/scl/"></nobr></a> -- commercial, 
NOT KNOWN TO WORK</h5> 
 
<p>Instructions</p> 
<ul> 
  <li>After installing, add a symlink named <span class="v">scl</span> to your $PATH</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>I have not been able to get <span class="tt">scl</span> to complete the proofs, as it 
segfaults on me during the proofs in the utilities directory.  I have not spent much 
effort to debug this, and perhaps the problem is specific to my platform (Linux x86-64) 
or fixed in a more recent version.</p> 
 
<h5>Other Lisps?</h5> 
 
<p>It may not be difficult to port Milawa to another Lisp implementation.  In 
my experience, you will probably need to increase various resource limits, 
e.g., the maximum call-stack size, heap size, and so on, to successfully finish 
the checks.  Also, you'll need to implement the <span class="tt">save-and-exit</span> function 
for the new Lisp, or not use checkpointing.</p> 
 
 
<h3>2. Build the Proof Checker</h3> 
 
<p>The original (Common Lisp, not <a href="MILAWA____JITAWA.html">jitawa</a>-Lisp) version of the Milawa 
kernel is located at:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">acl2/books/projects/milawa/milawa.lsp</pre> 
 
<p>When you load this into your Lisp, it will create a new executable.  The 
proper way to do this is to go to the <span class="v">acl2/books/projects/milawa</span> 
directory, then start your lisp and run:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(defconstant image-extension "&lt;name&gt;")
(load "milawa.lsp")</pre> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">&lt;name&gt;</span> you give determines the file extensions for the Milawa 
images that will be generated.  I typically give names like "ccl-linux64" or 
"sbcl-win32", and so on, so that I know what kind of platform each image is 
for. (It's perfectly fine to check the proofs with multiple Lisps.)</p> 
 
<p>This should produce a new file named <span class="v">base.&lt;name&gt;</span>, which is the "base 
system," i.e., the kernel, with no theorems loaded.</p> 
 
<p>At this point, to make sure everything is working you should run </p> 
 
<pre class="code">./milawa-&lt;lispname&gt; base.&lt;name&gt;</pre> 
 
<p>For instance, if you decided to use CCL, and your <span class="v">image-extension</span> is 
<span class="v">ccl-darwin</span>, then you would run:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">./milawa-ccl base.ccl-darwin</pre> 
 
<p>The script may print a message asking you to configure it, e.g., for SBCL 
and CMUCL you will need to figure out appropriate memory settings for your 
host.  If all is well, it should print "Milawa Proof Checker," and you can 
quit by sending EOF.</p> 
 
<h3>3. Check the Proofs.</h3> 
 
<p>Estimated time: 1-2 days (see the benchmarks in my dissertation for a better 
idea.)</p> 
 
<p>Now that everything is set up, you can use the <span class="v">final-checks.sh</span> script 
to check the proofs.</p> 
 
<p>The usage is:</p> 
<pre class="code">cd acl2/books/projects/milawa
sh final-checks.sh &lt;lispname&gt; &lt;name&gt;</pre> 
 
<p>For instance:</p> 
<pre class="code">sh final-checks.sh ccl ccl-darwin</pre> 
 
<p>This will result in a lot of output, and I generally <span class="v">tee</span> it into a 
file.  After each directory, a checkpoint is taken so that in the event of a 
power outage or something, you will only lose the current directory's 
work (which may still be a few hours).</p> 
 
<p>If everything is successful, the file <span class="v">user.&lt;name&gt;</span> will be produced. 
This image will have the highest-level proof checker already loaded and ready 
to go.</p>
