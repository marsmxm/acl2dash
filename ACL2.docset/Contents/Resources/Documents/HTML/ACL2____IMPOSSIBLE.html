<p>Prove that some case is unreachable using <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s.</p><p>Logically, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPOSSIBLE.html">impossible</a>)</span> just returns <span class="v">nil</span>, and 
<span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPOSSIBLE.html">impossible</a> x)</span> just returns <span class="v">x</span>.</p> 
 
<p>But <span class="v">impossible</span> has a guard of <span class="v">nil</span>, so whenever you use it in a 
function, you will be obliged to prove that it cannot be executed when the 
guard holds.</p> 
 
<p>What good is this?  One use is to make sure that every possible case in a 
sum type has been covered.  For instance, you can write:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> f ((x whatever-p))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CASE.html">case</a> (type-of x)
    (:foo (handle-foo ...))
    (:bar (handle-bar ...))
    (otherwise (<a href="ACL2____IMPOSSIBLE.html">impossible</a>))))</pre> 
 
<p>This is a nice style in that, if we later extend <span class="v">x</span> so that its type can 
also be <span class="v">:baz</span>, then the guard verification will fail and remind us that we 
need to extend <span class="v">f</span> to handle <span class="v">:baz</span> types as well.</p> 
 
<p>The optional argument to <span class="v">impossible</span> can be used to design your code in 
a more convenient way.  Suppose that in the example of the function <span class="v">f</span> 
above, both <span class="v">handle-foo</span> and <span class="v">handle-bar</span> are functions that always 
return integers.  Then by changing <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPOSSIBLE.html">impossible</a>)</span> to, say, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPOSSIBLE.html">impossible</a>
0)</span> in the definition of <span class="v">f</span>, you can now prove that <span class="v">f</span> always returns 
an integer.  With the original definition of <span class="v">f</span>, you would require the 
additional hypothesis <span class="v">(whatever-p x)</span>, and as part of the proof of the 
theorem, ACL2 would have to re-prove that the <span class="v">otherwise</span> case is 
unreachable.</p> 
 
<p>If somehow <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPOSSIBLE.html">impossible</a>)</span> is ever executed  e.g., due to program 
mode code that is violating guards, or because <a href="ACL2____GUARD-CHECKING.html">guard-checking</a> has been 
set to <span class="v">nil</span> or <span class="v">:none</span>  it just causes a hard error.</p>
