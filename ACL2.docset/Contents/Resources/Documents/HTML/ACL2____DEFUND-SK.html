<p>Define a function with quantifier 
          and disable it and its associated rewrite rule.</p><p>This is exactly like a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span>, except for two differences:</p><ul>
<li>It also generates an event to disable the function definition. 
      Thus, this macro is consistent with built-in macros like 
      <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUND.html">defund</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUND-NX.html">defund-nx</a></span>.</li>
<li>It also supports a <span class="v">:thm-enable</span> input, <span class="v">nil</span> by default, 
      that is used to generate, when <span class="v">nil</span>, an event to disable 
      the rewrite rule associated to the function. 
      This rewrite rule is the one 
      whose name is controlled by the <span class="v">:thm-name</span> option; 
      thus, the <span class="v">:thm-enable</span> option of <span class="v">defund-sk2</span> 
      is named consistently. 
      No disabling event is generated if <span class="v">:thm-enable</span> is <span class="v">t</span>; 
      the rewrite rule is left enabled.</li>
</ul>
