<p>Giving <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> permission to handle a user-defined function in proofs</p><p>The word ``warrant'' is defined in the Merriam-Webster dictionary 
  as ``a commission or document giving authority to do something....''</p> 
 
  <p>The discussion below mentions the concept of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span>s, which are 
  easily confused with warrants.  See the discussion of <b>Badges versus 
  Warrants</b> at the top of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFBADGE.html">defbadge</a></span>.  But roughly put, badges extend 
  the ACL2 syntax and warrants extend the proof theory.  You'll need a badge 
  for <span class="v">fn</span> to allow the system to syntactically analyze <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn
  ...)</span>.  You'll need a both a badge and a warrant for <span class="v">fn</span> if you wish to 
  reason about that term with ACL2.  Badges and warrants also have impact on 
  evaluation of forms in the top-level loop.  See <a href="ACL2____GUARANTEES-OF-THE-TOP-LEVEL-LOOP.html">guarantees-of-the-top-level-loop</a>.</p> 
 
  <p>In the ACL2 proof theory, the functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> 
  are undefined on user-defined function symbols.  To be precise, when 
  presented with a user-defined function symbol, <span class="v">badge</span> calls the weakly 
  constrained function <span class="v">badge-userfn</span> and <span class="v">apply$</span> calls the weakly 
  constrained function <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span>.  Warrants are terms that, if 
  available as hypotheses in a conjecture, further constrain those functions 
  for specific function symbols.  If there is a warrant for <span class="v">fn</span> among the 
  hypotheses of a conjecture, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> 'fn)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn ...)</span>  can 
  be simplified appropriately.  In particular, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> 'fn)</span> is simplified 
  to the actual badge of <span class="v">fn</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn ...)</span> is simplified to the 
  appropriate application of <span class="v">fn</span> provided the arguments are suitably <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a>.  We think of the warrant for <span class="v">fn</span> giving <span class="v">badge</span> and <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  authority to expand on <span class="v">'fn</span>.  For reasons of logical consistency not 
  every <span class="v">fn</span> can have a warrant.  Warrants are issued, when possible, by 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <p>In the ACL2 evaluation theory — a consistent extension of the proof 
  theory — all warrants issued by <span class="v">defwarrant</span> are implicitly assumed, 
  meaning <span class="v">badge</span> and <span class="v">apply$</span> can be executed on warranted user-defined 
  function symbols at the top-level of the ACL2 loop without explicit mention 
  of the warrants.  In fact, just as the evaluation theory can — 
  ``magically'' — execute <span class="v">:program</span> mode functions despite the 
  absence of any axioms about them, the evaluation theory can execute a 
  well-formed <span class="v">apply$</span> on any <span class="v">:program</span> mode function that has a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span>.  However, for a <span class="v">:logic</span> mode function <span class="v">fn</span>, the top-level loop 
  cannot evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'fn ...)</span>  unless <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a> fn)</span> has 
  previously succeeded.  See <a href="ACL2____GUARANTEES-OF-THE-TOP-LEVEL-LOOP.html">guarantees-of-the-top-level-loop</a>.)  For a 
  discussion of the restrictions on when a <span class="v">fn</span> can be warranted, see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span>.  This topic discusses warrants <i>per se</i>, their names, their 
  logical meaning, when they must be explicitly added as hypotheses to 
  conjectures, and their consistency.</p> 
 
  <h3>Logical Definition of the Warrant of a Function</h3> 
 
  <p>If <i>fn</i> has a warrant, then the warrant is the term 
  <span class="tt">(apply$-warrant-</span><i>fn</i><span class="tt">)</span>, i.e., a call of the 0-ary 
  warrant function named, <span class="tt">apply$-warrant-</span><i>fn</i>.  That warrant 
  function name is admitted to the logic when <span class="v">defwarrant</span> succeeds on 
  <span class="v">fn</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>The warrant function for <span class="v">fn</span>, introduced by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a> fn)</span>, is 
  defined with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> because the warrant must specify the values 
  returned by <span class="tt">(apply$ 'fn args)</span> <i>for all possible</i> <span class="v">args</span>. 
  Recall that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> defer to two undefined 
  functions, <span class="v">badge-userfn</span> and <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span>, when they are applied to 
  user-defined function symbols.  The warrant for <span class="v">fn</span> is actually phrased 
  in terms of those two undefined functions.  By stipulating their values on 
  <span class="v">'fn</span> the warrant determines the values of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> 'fn)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a>
  'fn ...)</span>.  To create the warrant function for <span class="v">fn</span>, <span class="v">defwarrant</span> 
  must turn the ilks of <span class="v">fn</span> into tameness requirements on the corresponding 
  elements of the <span class="v">args</span> to which <span class="v">fn</span> will be applied by <span class="v">apply$</span>. 
  Each <span class="v">:FN</span> argument must be a <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a> function and each <span class="v">:EXPR</span> 
  argument must be a <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a> expression.</p> 
 
  <p>It is easiest to understand the above paragraph by looking at the 
  generated warrant function for <span class="v">foldr</span>, whose definition is shown at the 
  top of the documentation for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> and whose <a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> is 
  <span class="v">(APPLY$-BADGE 3 1 NIL :FN NIL)</span>, indicating that <span class="v">foldr</span> takes 3 
  arguments of ilks <span class="v">NIL</span>, <span class="v">:FN</span>, and <span class="v">NIL</span>, and returns 1 result. 
  The warrant function for <span class="v">foldr</span> is defined as follows.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> apply$-warrant-foldr ()
  (<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (<a href="ACL2____ARGS.html">args</a>)
    (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____TAMEP-FUNCTIONP.html">tamep-functionp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADR.html">cadr</a> args))
             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____BADGE-USERFN.html">badge-userfn</a> 'FOLDR)
                         '(APPLY$-BADGE 3 1 NIL :FN NIL))
                  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42-USERFN.html">apply$-userfn</a> 'FOLDR args)
                         (foldr (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> args)
                                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADR.html">cadr</a> args)
                                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADDR.html">caddr</a> args))))))
  :constrain t)</pre> 
 
  <p>Notice also that the tameness hypothesis involves the universally 
  quantified variable <span class="v">args</span>, but that the first conjunct of the conclusion 
  does not mention that variable.  So we can read <span class="v">(apply$-warrant-foldr)</span> 
  as equivalent to the conjunction of:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____BADGE-USERFN.html">badge-userfn</a> 'FOLDR)
       '(APPLY$-BADGE 3 1 NIL :FN NIL))</pre> 
 
  <p>and</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (<a href="ACL2____ARGS.html">args</a>)
    (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____TAMEP-FUNCTIONP.html">tamep-functionp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADR.html">cadr</a> args))
             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42-USERFN.html">apply$-userfn</a> 'FOLDR args)
                    (foldr (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> args)
                           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADR.html">cadr</a> args)
                           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADDR.html">caddr</a> args)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>The first specifies the value of the undefined function used by <span class="v">badge</span> 
  to find the badge of a user-defined function.  The second specifies the 
  behavior of the undefined function used by <span class="v">apply$</span> to <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  <span class="tt">'FOLDR</span> and requires that the second element of <span class="v">args</span> be a <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a> function.</p> 
 
  <p>Finally, notice that the warrant function for <span class="v">foldr</span>, 
  <span class="v">apply$-warrant-foldr</span>, ancestrally depends on <span class="v">foldr</span>: <span class="v">foldr</span> is 
  called in the <span class="v">defun-sk</span>.  That is crucial to avoiding the <span class="v">LOCAL</span> 
  problem noted in <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-APPLY_42.html">introduction-to-apply$</a>.  If the warrant for 
  <span class="v">foldr</span> is required for a theorem's proof (which it will be if the proof 
  involves ``expanding'' <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'FOLDR ...)</span>), then the theorem is 
  ancestrally dependent on <span class="v">foldr</span> even though that function symbol may not 
  be otherwise mentioned in the theorem.  That, in turn, means that <span class="v">foldr</span> 
  may not be a locally defined symbol in the environment from which the theorem 
  is exported.</p> 
 
  <p>Now consider a function symbol that returns more than one result.  Suppose 
  the badge of <span class="v">add-and-subtract</span> is <span class="v">(APPLY$-BADGE 2 2 . T)</span>, meaning it 
  takes two ordinary objects and returns two results.  The function is tame and 
  so no tameness requirements are imposed on its application.  Its warrant is 
  defined</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> apply$-warrant-add-and-subtract ()
  (<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (<a href="ACL2____ARGS.html">args</a>)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____BADGE-USERFN.html">badge-userfn</a> 'add-and-subtract)
                '(APPLY$-BADGE 2 2 . T))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'add-and-subtract args)
                (<a href="ACL2____MV-LIST.html">mv-list</a> 2
                         (add-and-subtract (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> args) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADR.html">cadr</a> args)))))))</pre> 
 
  <h3>Rewrite Rules that Lift and Force the Warrant</h3> 
 
  <p>Once <span class="v">defwarrant</span> has introduced the warrant function for <i>fn</i> it 
  proves two rewrite rules, conjoined under the name <span class="tt">apply$-</span><i>fn</i>, 
  that ``lifts'' the warrant from the level of the two undefined functions to 
  the level of <span class="v">badge</span> and <span class="v">apply$</span>.  In the case of <span class="v">foldr</span> the rules 
  are:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> apply$-foldr
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> (apply$-warrant-foldr))
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> 'FOLDR)
                       '(APPLY$-BADGE 3 1 NIL :FN NIL)))
       (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> (apply$-warrant-foldr))
                     (<a href="ACL2____TAMEP-FUNCTIONP.html">tamep-functionp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> args))))
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'FOLDR args)
                       (foldr (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> args)
                              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> args))
                              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> args))))))))</pre> 
 
  <p>Observe that these rules say that if <span class="v">(apply$-warrant-foldr)</span> is 
  available as a hypothesis, then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> 'FOLDR)</span> is <span class="v">(APPLY$-BADGE 3 1
  NIL :FN NIL)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'FOLDR args)</span> has the naively expected 
  behavior of calling <span class="v">foldr</span>, provided the second element of <span class="v">args</span> is a 
  <span class="v">tamep-functionp</span>.  Also note that the warrant hypothesis is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d in both rules.</p> 
 
  <p>The effect of these rules is if either <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> 'FOLDR)</span> or any instance 
  of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'FOLDR args)</span> arises during a proof, the warrant for 
  <span class="v">foldr</span> is raised and either relieved or forced.  The <span class="v">badge</span> and 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> terms are simplified whether the warrant is present or not, but 
  if the warrant is not among the hypotheses and the proof is otherwise 
  successful, the warrant for <span class="v">foldr</span> will show up in a checkpoint.</p> 
 
  <p>If no warrant has been issued for <span class="v">foldr</span> these terms will not 
  simplify.</p> 
 
  <h3>Determining the Necessary Warrants</h3> 
 
  <p><i>There is no easy way to determine the warrants you'll need to make a 
  formula a theorem.</i>  At first this seems to be a problem that could be solved 
  with a few rules of thumb and indeed, there are a few useful rules.  But they 
  don't guarantee success.</p> 
 
  <p><i>Rule 1.</i> One way to determine sufficient warrants for a formula to 
  be a theorem is to attempt to prove the formula without warrants and see the 
  checkpoints.  This may have to be repeated to collect sufficient warrants and 
  can be frustrating.  Furthermore, as illustrated further below, it can lead 
  to unnecessary warrants.</p> 
 
  <p>Most users attempt to anticipate what warrants are needed.</p> 
 
  <p><i>Rule 2.</i> You will probably need a warrant hypothesis for every 
  user-defined function symbol mentioned in the fully translated term occupying 
  any slot of ilk <span class="v">:FN</span> in the formula you're trying to prove.  The two 
  common situations are quoted user-defined function symbols in such slots and 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a></span> expressions.  In the latter case, you must consider every 
  user-defined function symbol in the <i>fully translated</i> body of the 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a></span> expression.  (If you've ignored our recommendations to use 
  <span class="v">lambda$</span> instead of hand-typed quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects, you'll have to 
  look at those too.)</p> 
 
  <p>But Rule 2 says ``probably need a warrant'' because whether you do or not 
  depends on what you're proving.  In the examples below, suppose we have 
  carried out these events.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "projects/apply/top" :dir :system)

(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> sq (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x))</pre> 
 
  <p>and recall that <span class="v">collect$</span> is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span> scion logically defined 
  as</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> collect$ (fn lst)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      nil
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)))
            (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>No warrant is <i>really</i> needed to prove</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'sq (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> a b))
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'sq a) (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'sq b))))</pre> 
 
  <p>because it <i>could</i> be proved by appealing to the more general</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> a b))
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> fn a)
                    (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> fn b))))</pre> 
 
  <p>which makes clear that the properties of <span class="v">sq</span> are totally irrelevant to 
  the proof of this formula.</p> 
 
  <p>But if you followed Rule 1 and just submitted</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'sq (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> a b))
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'sq a)
                    (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'sq b))))</pre> 
 
  <p>the proof would fail with a checkpoint indicating that you need the 
  warrant for <span class="v">sq</span>.  That happens because the :rewrite rules proved by 
  <span class="v">defwarrant</span>, discussed in the previous section and named <span class="v">apply$-sq</span> 
  in the case of <span class="v">sq</span>, fire and force that warrant.  However, you could 
  disable that rule and get the proof without a warrant.</p> 
 
  <p>To further dim our hopes for a simple way to identify warrants, 
  consider</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> square (i) (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'sq (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> i)))</pre> 
 
  <p>and then the proof of</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (square i) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> i i)))</pre> 
 
  <p>This theorem requires the warrant for <span class="v">sq</span> even though <span class="v">'sq</span> is 
  not mentioned in the top-level statement of the theorem.  The problem, of course, 
  is that the mention of <span class="v">'sq</span> in a <span class="v">:FN</span> slot is mentioned in the definition of 
  <span class="v">square</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><i>Rule 3.</i> You may need warrants for any symbols used in <span class="v">:FN</span> 
  slots in the definitions of any function appearing in the formula.</p> 
 
  <p>And then of course there is usual reason you need forgotten hypotheses:  some lemma 
  critical to your proof has that hypothesis.</p> 
 
  <p>For example, one could imagine proving</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> lemma
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (apply$-warrant-sq)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (square x) (sq x))))</pre> 
 
  <p>and then try to prove</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (square x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x))
     :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> square))))</pre> 
 
  <p>hoping the lemma would reduce <span class="v">(square x)</span> to <span class="v">(sq x)</span> and then 
  <span class="v">(sq x)</span> would expand to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x)</span>.  But of course, the lemma isn't 
  applicable because we can't establish its hypothesis.  The point here is that 
  another source of required warrants can be the warrant hypotheses of any 
  lemmas needed for the proof.  We could posit a ``Rule 4'' but what's the 
  point?</p> 
 
  <p>Returning to the first thing we said in this section, there is no easy 
  sure-fire way to determine the warrants you'll need.  It just depends on the 
  functions you're manipulating, the cases explored in the proof, the 
  hypotheses of crucial lemmas, etc.  However, our experience is that it's not 
  nearly so hard as we're suggesting here!</p> 
 
  <p>Basically you'll need a warrant for <span class="v">fn</span> if the proof requires 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> to behave as naively expected on <span class="v">'fn</span> or the warrant is 
  required for some lemma.  Chances are you'll know when you're depending on 
  the meaning of a quoted symbol and when you're not.  And Rule 1 will 
  eventually get you there though it may generate unnecessary warrant 
  hypotheses.</p> 
 
  <p>There is another piece of good news perhaps best explained by example.</p> 
 
  <p>Imagine that you've defined and warranted your own versions of the 
  familiar list concatenation and list reverse functions under the names 
  <span class="v">ap</span> and <span class="v">rv</span>.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> ap (x y)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> x)
      y
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)
            (ap (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x) y))))

(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> rv (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> x)
      nil
      (ap (rv (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>What warrant(s) do you need to prove</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> x)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'rv (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'rv (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x)))) x))?</pre> 
 
  <p>You clearly need the warrant for <span class="v">rv</span>.  But do you need the warrant for 
  its subfunction <span class="v">ap</span>?  Some users fall into the trap of thinking they do. 
  They think they'll need warrants for all the subfunctions of any function 
  requiring a warrant.  We fall into this trap when we think <i>all 
  evaluation</i> is carried out by <span class="v">ev$</span> and <span class="v">apply$</span>.  Put another way, 
  if we defined</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> rv1 (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> x)
      nil
      (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'ap
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (rv1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))
                    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))))))</pre> 
 
  <p>and then tried to prove</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> x)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'rv1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'rv1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x)))) x))</pre> 
 
  <p>we would indeed need warrants for both <span class="v">rv1</span> and <span class="v">ap</span>, as per Rule 
  3, because <span class="v">rv1</span> <span class="v">apply$</span>s <span class="v">'ap</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>But the warrant for the original <span class="v">rv</span> says that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'rv args)</span> 
  is (unconditionally) equal to <span class="v">(rv (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> args))</span>.  There are no 
  <span class="v">apply$</span>s left in the problem once we get to a call of the ACL2 function 
  <span class="v">rv</span>.  We don't need any warrants, even to evaluate a function we called 
  via <span class="v">apply$</span> unless the definition of the function itself involves further 
  <span class="v">apply$</span>s.</p> 
 
  <h3>A Convenient Macro for Conjoining Warrants</h3> 
 
  <p>Because ``<span class="tt">APPLY$-WARRANT-</span><i>fn</i>'' is hard to remember, we 
  provide a macro for referring to the conjunction of warrant terms for a list 
  of functions.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a> fn1 fn2 ... fnk)</pre> 
 
  <p>where each <span class="v">fni</span> is the name of a defined function on which 
  <span class="v">defwarrant</span> has been previously called and succeeded.  (Actually, we 
  allow the <span class="v">fni</span> to include certain primitive function symbols already 
  built into <span class="v">apply$</span>, but for the moment we ignore the possible presence of 
  such symbols among the arguments to <span class="v">warrant</span>.)  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">Warrant</a> fn1 fn2
  ... fnk)</span> expands to:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (APPLY$-WARRANT-fn1)
     (APPLY$-WARRANT-fn2)
     ...
     (APPLY$-WARRANT-fnk))</pre> 
 
  <p>Because there are over 800 ACL2 primitives built into <span class="v">apply$</span>, it can 
  be hard to look at a conjecture involving, say, a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a></span> term, and 
  list all and only the function names that need warrants.  For example, if the 
  body of the <span class="v">lambda$</span> term calls <span class="v">logeqv</span> it will expand into 
  <span class="v">binary-logeqv</span> and the diligent user might anticipate, accurately, that 
  the <span class="v">ev$</span> of that body will involve <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'BINARY-LOGEQV ...)</span> and 
  thus might suppose that <span class="v">binary-logeqv</span> be included among the <span class="v">fni</span> 
  listed in the <span class="v">warrant</span> hypothesis.  But no warrant for <span class="v">binary-logeqv</span> 
  exists, that is, <span class="v">apply$-warrant-binary-logeqv</span> is not defined, because 
  <span class="v">binary-logeqv</span> is built into <span class="v">apply$</span>.  For this reason, we do not 
  insist that every <span class="v">fni</span> in <span class="v">warrant</span>'s argument be a function 
  possessing a warrant.  Instead, the <span class="v">warrant</span> macro ignores those <span class="v">fni</span> 
  built into <span class="v">apply$</span>.  It does cause an error if one of the <span class="v">fni</span> has no 
  warrant and is not built in.</p> 
 
  <h3>Why Warrants Don't Render Theorems Vacuous</h3> 
 
  <p>Adding warrants to formulas certainly restricts (weakens) the resulting 
  theorem since it is only applicable when the warrant is assumed.  But an 
  important question to ponder is whether adding warrants can actually make a 
  formula vacuously valid?  That is, can a set of warrants simply be 
  unsatisfiable so that any formula having that set of warrants among its 
  hypotheses is a theorem?  Put another way, is there a model for the set of 
  all warrants introduced by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span>?</p> 
 
  <p>The answer is yes.  This is discussed in <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/papers/apply/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>``Limited 
  Second-Order Functionality in a First-Order Setting''<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/papers/apply/index.html"></nobr></a> by Matt Kaufmann 
  and J Strother Moore.  For any set of functions warranted by <span class="v">defwarrant</span> 
  it is possible to <i>define</i>, under the standard ACL2 definitional 
  principle, versions of those functions (together with <span class="v">apply$</span>, <span class="v">ev$</span>, 
  etc.) and then make attachments to the undefined <span class="v">badge-userfn</span> and 
  <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span>, and so that every warrant is provably equal to <span class="v">T</span>. 
  In fact, the resultant theory is the basis of ACL2's evaluation theory where 
  all warranted functions can be <span class="v">apply$</span>d (under the appropriate tameness 
  requirements) without explicit mention of warrants.  The crux of the proof is 
  admitting a big mutually recursive clique containing versions of <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  and all of its <a href="ACL2____SCION.html">scion</a>s, by inventing a measure that provably decreases 
  as <span class="v">apply$</span> and the scions call each other.  The keys to that measure's 
  existence are the restrictions imposed by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span> and <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a>ness.  See the paper for a sketch of the proof and see the comment 
  titled <span class="tt">Essay on Admitting a Model for Apply$ and the Functions that Use 
  It</span> in the ACL2 source file <span class="v">apply-raw.lisp</span>.</p>
