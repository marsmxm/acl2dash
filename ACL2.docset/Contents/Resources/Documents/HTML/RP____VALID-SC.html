<p>A function that checks the side-conditions in a term is correct</p><p> (valid-sc term a) traverses the term and evaluates the 
 side-conditions. Whenever it encounters a term of the form (rp ''prop x), it 
 calls (rp-evlt `(prop ,x) a). Whenever it encounters a term of the form (if 
 test then else), it recursively calls valid-sc for the test; and 'then' and 
 'else' cases under the context of (rp-evlt test a)</p> 
<p> For every step that RP-Rewriter takes, we prove that valid-sc on terms are 
 maintained. Therefore, users have to prove that meta-rules also retains this invariance.</p>
