<p>Representation for constant integer literals with no X or Z bits.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>origwidth  <a href="ACL2____POSP.html">posp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Subtle; generally should <b>not be used</b>; see below.</dd> 
 
<dt>value  <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The most important part of a constant integer.  Even 
                immediately upon parsing the value has already been determined 
                and is available to you as an ordinary natural number.</dd> 
 
<dt>origtype  <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPRTYPE-P.html">vl-exprtype-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Subtle; generally should <b>not be used</b>; see below.</dd> 
 
<dt>wasunsized  <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Set to <span class="v">t</span> by the parser for unsized constants like <span class="v">5</span> 
                and <span class="v">'b0101</span>, but not for sized ones like <span class="v">4'b0101</span>.</dd> 
 
</dl><h5>Additional Requirements</h5><p>The following invariant is enforced on the fields:</p><pre class="code">(&lt; value (expt 2 origwidth))</pre><p>Constant integers are produced from source code constructs like 
<span class="v">5</span>, <span class="v">4'b0010</span>, and <span class="v">3'h0</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Note that the value of a constant integer is never negative.  In Verilog 
there are no negative literals; instead, an expression like <span class="v">-5</span> is 
basically parsed the same as <span class="v">-(5)</span>, so the negative sign is not part of the 
literal.  See Section 3.5.1 of the Verilog-2005 standard.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">origwidth</span> and <span class="v">origtype</span> fields are subtle.  They indicate the 
<i>original</i> width and signedness of the literal as specified in the source 
code, e.g., if the source code contains <span class="v">8'sd 65</span>, then the origwidth will 
be 8 and the origtype will be <span class="v">:vl-signed.</span>  These fields are subtle because 
<a href="VL2014____EXPRESSION-SIZING.html">expression-sizing</a> generally alters the widths and types of 
subexpressions, so these may not represent the final widths and types of these 
constants in the context of the larger expression.  Instead, the preferred way 
to determine a constint's final width and sign is to inspect the <span class="v">vl-atom-p</span> 
that contains it.</p> 
 
<p>We insist that <span class="v">0 &lt;= value &lt;= 2^origwidth</span> for every constant integer. 
If our <a href="VL2014____LEXER.html">lexer</a> encounters something ill-formed like <span class="v">3'b 1111</span>, it 
emits a warning and truncates from the left, as required by Section 3.5.1 (page 
10) of the Verilog-2005 standard.</p> 
 
<p>Note that in Verilog, unsized integer constants like <span class="v">5</span> or <span class="v">'b101</span> 
have an implementation-dependent size of at least 32 bits.  VL historically 
tried to treat such numbers in an abstract way, saying they had "integer 
size".  But we eventually decided that this was too error-prone and we now 
instead act like a 32-bit implementation even at the level of our lexer.  This 
conveniently makes the width of a constant integer just a positive number.  On 
the other hand, some expressions may produce different results on 32-bit 
versus, say, 64-bit implementations.  Because of this, we added the 
<span class="v">wasunsized</span> field so that we might later statically check for problematic 
uses of unsized constants.</p> 
 
<p>All constints are automatically created with <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>.  This is probably 
pretty trivial, but it seems nice.  For instance, the constant integers from 
0-32 are probably used thousands of times throughout a design for bit-selects 
and wire ranges, so sharing their memory may be useful.</p>
