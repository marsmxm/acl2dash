<p>Common Lisp breaks</p><pre class="code">Example:
Broken at PROVE.  Type :H for Help.
&gt;&gt;:Q

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>You may interrupt the system by typing various control character sequences. 
 The precise sequences are determined by the host Lisp and operating system 
 environment.  For example, in GCL and Allegro Common Lisp, a console interrupt 
 is caused by typing ``<span class="v">ctrl-c</span>''.  If, however, the GCL or Allegro is 
 running in an Emacs shell buffer, one must type ``ctrl-c ctrl-c''.</p> 
 
 <p>If a break occurs, for example because of a bug in ACL2 or a user 
 interrupt, the break will run a Common Lisp read-eval-print loop, not an ACL2 
 read-eval-print loop.  This may not be obvious if the <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a>s in the 
 two loops are similar.  Because you are typing to a Common Lisp evaluator, you 
 must be careful.  It is possible to damage your ACL2 state in irreparable ways 
 by executing non-ACL2 Common Lisp.  It is even possible to disrupt and render 
 inaccurate the interrupted evaluation of a simple ACL2 expression.</p> 
 
 <p>For ACL2 built on most host Common Lisps, you will see the string <span class="v">[RAW
 LISP]</span> in the <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a> at a break, to emphasize that one is inside a 
 break and hence should quit from the break.  For some host Common Lisps, the 
 top-level prompt also contains the string <span class="v">[RAW LISP]</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a> 
 for how to control printing of that string.</p> 
 
 <p>The most reliable way to return to the ACL2 top level is by executing the 
 following command: <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ABORT_12.html">abort!</a></span><span class="v">)</span>.  Appropriate cleanup will then 
 be done, which should leave you in an appropriate state.</p> 
 
 <p>However, you may be able to quit from the break in the normal Lisp manner 
 (as with <span class="v">:q</span> in GCL or CCL, <span class="v">:reset</span> in Allegro CL, and <span class="v">q</span> in CMU 
 CL).  If this attempt to quit is successful, it will return you to the 
 innermost ACL2 read-eval-print loop, with appropriate cleanup performed first. 
 Note that if you are within a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a></span> environment when the break occurs, 
 quitting from the break will only return you to that environment, not to the 
 top of ACL2's read-eval-print loop.</p>
