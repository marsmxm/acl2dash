<p>Undo the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s back through a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____UNDO.html">undo</a> for an introduction to undoing commands.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Examples:
:ubt :max      ; undo back through the most recent command
               ; (which just means undo the most recent command)
:ubt :x        ; same as :ubt :max
:u             ; same as :ubt :max with no questions asked
:ubt fn        ; undo back through the introduction of fn
               ; (including all the other events in fn's block)
:ubt 5         ; undo back through the fifth command executed
:ubt (:max -4) ; undo back through the most recent five commands
:ubt (:x -4)   ; undo back through the most recent five commands</pre> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Ubt</span> takes one argument, a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor, and undoes the 
 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s from <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MAX.html">max</a></span> (aka <span class="v">:x</span>) through the one 
 described.  See <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PBT.html">Pbt</a></span> will print the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s that <span class="v">ubt</span> will undo.  <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OOPS.html">Oops</a></span> will undo the undo. 
 See <a href="ACL2____OOPS.html">oops</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Ubt</span> can cause errors but not queries.  To get queries as well, see 
 <a href="ACL2____UBT_F3.html">ubt?</a>.  To get neither errors nor queries, see <a href="ACL2____UBT_12.html">ubt!</a>..</p> 
 
 <p>It is important to remember that a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> may create several <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  That is, the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> that introduces <span class="v">fn1</span> may also 
 introduce <span class="v">fn2</span>.  Undoing the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> that created either of these 
 will undo them both.  The <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> created by a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> constitute 
 the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>'s ``block'' and we can only undo entire blocks.  Use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PCB.html">pcb</a></span> to print the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> block of a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> if you wish to see 
 what will be lost by undoing the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Ubt</span> will not undo into ``prehistory''.  <span class="v">:Ubt 1</span> will undo all of 
 your <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s.  But <span class="v">:ubt -5</span> will cause an error, warning you that 
 <span class="v">:ubt</span> cannot undo system initialization.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____U.html">u</a> for how to undo just the latest command.  See <a href="ACL2____UBU.html">ubu</a>, 
 <a href="ACL2____UBU_12.html">ubu!</a>, and <a href="ACL2____UBU_F3.html">ubu?</a> for how to undo back up to, but not including, 
 the current command.</p>
