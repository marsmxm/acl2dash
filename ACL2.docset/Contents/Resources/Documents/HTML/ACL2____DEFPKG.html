<p>Define a new symbol package</p><pre class="code">Example:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "MY-PKG"
        (<a href="ACL2____UNION-EQ.html">union-eq</a> *acl2-exports*
                  *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*))

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "name" term doc-string)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">"name"</span> is a non-empty string consisting of standard characters 
 (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____STANDARD-CHAR-P.html">standard-char-p</a>), none of which is lower case, that names the 
 package to be created; <span class="v">term</span> is a variable-free expression that evaluates 
 to a list of symbols, where no two distinct symbols in the list may have the 
 same <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span>, to be imported into the newly created package; and 
 <span class="v">doc-string</span>, if non-<span class="v">nil</span>, is an optional string that can provide 
 documentation but is essentially ignored by ACL2.  The name of the new package 
 must be ``new'': the host lisp must not contain any package of that name. 
 There are two exceptions to this newness rule, discussed at the end of this 
 documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>(There is actually an additional argument, book-path, that is used for 
 error reporting but has no logical content.  Users should generally ignore 
 this argument, as well as the rest of this sentence: a book-path will be 
 specified for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> events added by ACL2 to the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of 
 a book's <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>; see <a href="ACL2____HIDDEN-DEATH-PACKAGE.html">hidden-death-package</a>.)</p> 
 
 <p>There are two restrictions on <span class="v">term</span> aside from those mentioned above. 
 Both restrictions relate to ancestral uses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> in <span class="v">term</span>, 
 i.e., uses of <span class="v">apply$</span> by <span class="v">term</span> or any function that might be called 
 during the evaluation of <span class="v">term</span>.  First, only badged primitive functions 
 may be applied.  See <a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a> for a way to obtain the complete list of 
 badged primitives.  Second, <span class="v">loop$</span> and <span class="v">lambda$</span> may not be used 
 anywhere in the ancestry of term.  See <span class="v">ignored-attachment</span> and 
 <span class="v">prohibition-of-loop$-and-lambda$</span> for more discussion.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Defpkg</span> forms can be entered at the top-level of the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> loop.  They should not occur in <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> (see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>After a successful <span class="v">defpkg</span> it is possible to ``intern'' a string into 
 the package using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a></span>.  The result is a symbol 
 that is in the indicated package, provided the imports allow it.  For example, 
 suppose <span class="v">'my-pkg::abc</span> is a symbol whose <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> is 
 <span class="v">"MY-PKG"</span>.  Suppose further that the imports specified in the 
 <span class="v">defpkg</span> for <span class="v">"MY-PKG"</span> do not include a symbol whose <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> is <span class="v">"XYZ"</span>.  Then</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a> "XYZ" 'my-pkg::abc)</pre> 
 
 <p>returns a symbol whose <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> is <span class="v">"XYZ"</span> and whose <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> is <span class="v">"MY-PKG"</span>.  On the other hand, if the imports to 
 the <span class="v">defpkg</span> does include a symbol with the name <span class="v">"XYZ"</span>, say in the 
 package <span class="v">"LISP"</span>, then</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a> "XYZ" 'my-pkg::abc)</pre> 
 
 <p>returns that symbol (which is uniquely determined by the restriction on the 
 imports list above).  See <a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Upon admission of a <span class="v">defpkg</span> event, the function <span class="v">pkg-imports</span> is 
 extended to compute a list of all symbols imported into the given package, 
 without duplicates.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Defpkg</span> is the only means by which an ACL2 user can create a new 
 package or specify what it imports.  That is, ACL2 does not support the Common 
 Lisp functions <span class="v">make-package</span> or <span class="v">import</span>.  Currently, ACL2 does not 
 support exporting at all.</p> 
 
 <p>The Common Lisp function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____INTERN.html">intern</a></span> is weakly supported by ACL2; see 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____INTERN.html">intern</a>.  A more general form of that function is also provided: see 
 <a href="ACL2____INTERN_42.html">intern$</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We now explain the two exceptions to the newness rule for package names. 
 The careful experimenter will note that if a package is created with a 
 <span class="v">defpkg</span> that is subsequently undone, the host lisp system will contain the 
 created package even after the undo.  Because ACL2 hangs onto <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s 
 after they have been undone, e.g., to implement <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OOPS.html">oops</a></span> but, more 
 importantly, to implement error recovery, we cannot actually destroy a package 
 upon undoing it.  Thus, the first exception to the newness rule is that 
 <span class="v">name</span> is allowed to be the name of an existing package if that package was 
 created by an undone <span class="v">defpkg</span> and the newly proposed set of imports is 
 identical to the old one.  See <a href="ACL2____PACKAGE-REINCARNATION-IMPORT-RESTRICTIONS.html">package-reincarnation-import-restrictions</a>.  This exception does not violate 
 the spirit of the newness rule, since one is disinclined to believe in the 
 existence of undone packages.  The second exception is that <span class="v">name</span> is 
 allowed to be the name of an existing package if the package was created by a 
 <span class="v">defpkg</span> with identical set of imports.  That is, it is permissible to 
 execute ``redundant'' <span class="v">defpkg</span> <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s.  The redundancy test is 
 based on the values of the two import forms (comparing them after sorting and 
 removing duplicates), not on the forms themselves.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">defpkg</span> performs evaluation in so-called <a href="ACL2____SAFE-MODE.html">safe-mode</a>, 
 which can slow down evaluation significantly but checks <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s on 
 <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">primitive</a>s.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we explain why we require the package name to contain standard 
 characters, none of which is lower case.  We have seen at least one 
 implementation that handled lower-case package names incorrectly.  Since we 
 see no need for lower-case characters in package names, which can lead to 
 confusion anyhow (note for example that <span class="v">foo::bar</span> is a symbol whose <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span> is <span class="v">"FOO"</span>, not <span class="v">"foo"</span>), we simply disallow 
 them.  Since the notion of ``lower case'' is only well-specified in Common 
 Lisp for standard characters, we restrict to these.</p>
