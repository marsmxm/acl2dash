<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=VL____VL-LITERAL">Click for Vl-literal in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A literal value of any kind, such as integer constants, string 
             literals, time literals, real numbers, etc.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>val — <a href="VL____VL-VALUE.html">vl-value</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The guts of the literal.  This explains what kind of literal it 
             is, its value, and has other related information.</dd> 
 
<dt>atts — <a href="VL____VL-ATTS.html">vl-atts</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Any attributes associated with this literal.  These are generally 
             <span class="v">nil</span> upon parsing since the Verilog or SystemVerilog grammars 
             don't really provide anywhere for <span class="tt">(* foo = bar, baz *)</span> 
             style attributes to be attached to literals.  However, we found 
             that it was convenient for every kind of expression to support 
             attributes, so we include them for internal use.</dd>
