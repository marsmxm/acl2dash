<p>(meta) exit the interactive proof-builder</p><pre class="code">Examples:
exit                        -- exit the interactive proof-builder
(<a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a> t)                    -- exit after printing a bogus defthm event
(<a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a> append-associativity) -- exit and create a defthm
                               event named append-associativity

General Forms:

exit --  Exit without storing an event.

(<a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a> t) -- Exit after printing a bogus defthm event, showing :INSTRUCTIONS.

(<a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a> event-name &amp;optional rule-classes do-it-flg) --
Exit, and perhaps store an event</pre> 
 
 <p>The command <span class="v">exit</span> returns you to the ACL2 loop.  At a later time, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">acl2::verify</a>)</span> may be executed to get back into the same interactive 
 proof-builder state, as long as there hasn't been an intervening use of the 
 proof-builder (otherwise see <a href="ACL2-PC____SAVE.html">ACL2-pc::save</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>When given one or more arguments as shown above, <span class="v">exit</span> still returns 
 you to the ACL2 loop, but first, if the interactive proof is complete, then it 
 attempts create a <span class="v">defthm</span> event with the specified <span class="v">event-name</span> and 
 <span class="v">rule-classes</span> (which defaults to <span class="v">(:rewrite)</span> if not supplied).  The 
 event will be printed to the terminal, and then normally the user will be 
 queried whether an event should really be created.  However, if the final 
 optional argument <span class="v">do-it-flg</span> is supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>, then an event 
 will be made without a query.</p> 
 
 <p>For example, the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a> top-pop-elim (:elim :rewrite) t)</pre> 
 
 <p>causes a <span class="v">defthm</span> event named <span class="v">top-pop-elim</span> to be created with 
 rule-classes <span class="v">(:elim :rewrite)</span>, without a query to the user (because of 
 the argument <span class="v">t</span>).</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> it is permitted for <span class="v">event-name</span> to be <span class="v">nil</span>.  In that 
 case, the name of the event will be the name supplied during the original call 
 of <span class="v">verify</span>.  (See <a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">verify</a> and <a href="ACL2-PC____COMMANDS.html">ACL2-pc::commands</a>.) 
 Also in that case, if <span class="v">rule-classes</span> is not supplied then it defaults to 
 the rule-classes supplied in the original call of <span class="v">verify</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Comments</span> on ``success'' and ``failure''.  An <span class="v">exit</span> instruction 
 will always ``fail'', so for example, if it appears as an argument of a 
 <span class="v">do-strict</span> instruction then none of the later (instruction) arguments will 
 be executed.  Moreover, the ``failure'' will be ``hard'' if an event is 
 successfully created or if the instruction is simply <span class="v">exit</span>; otherwise it 
 will be ``soft''.  See <a href="ACL2-PC____SEQUENCE.html">ACL2-pc::sequence</a> for an explanation of hard and 
 soft ``failures''.  An obscure but potentially important fact is that if the 
 ``failure'' is hard, then the error signal is a special signal that the 
 top-level interactive loop can interpret as a request to exit.  Thus for 
 example, a sequencing command that turns an error triple <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val
 state)</span> into <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> t val state)</span> would never cause an exit from the 
 interactive loop.</p> 
 
 <p>If the proof is not complete, then neither <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a> event-name ...)</span> nor 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a> t)</span> will cause an exit from the interactive loop.  However, in 
 that case either one will print out the original user-supplied goal (the one 
 that was supplied with the call to <span class="v">verify</span>) and the current list of 
 instructions.</p>
