<p>Determines partial suppression of output from <a href="ACL2____BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a></p><p>See <a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a> for relevant background on ``evisceration'': 
 eliding of subexpressions during printing.  Also see <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> for 
 background on the break-rewrite loop.</p> 
 
 <p>One of the settable evisc-tuples (see <a href="ACL2____SET-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-evisc-tuple</a>) can control 
 output from <a href="ACL2____BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a>: the <span class="v">brr-evisc-tuple</span>.  Unlike most other 
 evisc-tuples, if you set the <span class="v">brr-evisc-tuple</span> inside the break-rewrite 
 loop at level 1 of interaction (i.e., at the top level; see <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>), then its effect will persist even after you exit the 
 break.</p> 
 
 <p>A special value, <span class="v">:default</span>, is legal for this evisc-tuple, and is its 
 initial value.  In that case the actual evisc-tuple used during output from 
 <a href="ACL2____BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a> — which we call the <i>effective value</i> of the 
 <span class="v">brr-evisc-tuple</span> — is the value of the evisc-tuple for terms.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-evisc-tuple</a>, in particular, the discussion of the <span class="v">:term</span> site 
 for setting evisc-tuples.</p> 
 
 <p>You can see the effective value of the <span class="v">brr-evisc-tuple</span> by evaluating 
 the form, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SHOW-BRR-EVISC-TUPLE.html">show-brr-evisc-tuple</a>)</span>.  Note that this value is only printed 
 by such evaluation as a side-effect, not returned.  (Technical note: This is 
 because the <span class="v">brr-evisc-tuple</span> is maintained entirely within the 
 break-rewrite <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>.  That implementation enables the persistence of 
 this evisc-tuple within and without the break-rewrite loop.)</p>
