<p>Define an environment variable for use with <a href="ACL2____IFDEF.html">ifdef</a> and <a href="ACL2____IFNDEF.html">ifndef</a>, whose effect persists across include-books.</p><p>This does the same as <a href="ACL2____IFDEF-DEFINE.html">ifdef-define</a>, but the environment 
setting also happens when the book in which this form occurs is included 
elsewhere.  The build system attempts to accurately track which variables are 
defined where, for use by <a href="ACL2____IFDEF.html">ifdef</a> and <a href="ACL2____IFNDEF.html">ifndef</a>.</p>
