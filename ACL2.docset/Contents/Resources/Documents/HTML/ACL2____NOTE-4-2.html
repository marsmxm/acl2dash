<p>ACL2 Version  4.2 (January, 2011) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we roughly organize the changes since Version 4.2 into the following 
 categories of changes: existing features, new features, heuristic 
 improvements, bug fixes, distributed books, Emacs support, and experimental 
 versions.  Each change is described in just one category, though of course 
 many changes could be placed in more than one category.</p> 
 
 <p><b>CHANGES TO EXISTING FEATURES</b></p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a></span> utility can now do finer-grained 
 tracking, providing data for individual hypotheses and the conclusion of a 
 rule.  See <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a>.  To try this out, evaluate the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> :all)</span>; then see <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> 
 for a discussion of display options using <span class="v">show-accumulated-persistence</span>. 
 Thanks to Dave Greve for suggesting this new capability and collaborating on 
 its design and implementation.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a></span> utility now permits the use of <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> 
 mode functions, though this requires the use of a trust tag (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>).  See <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a> and for discussion of the new capability, see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFPROXY.html">defproxy</a>, which explains how part of this change involves allowing 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions to be declared <a href="ACL2____NON-EXECUTABLE.html">non-executable</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Redefinition (see <a href="ACL2____LD-REDEFINITION-ACTION.html">ld-redefinition-action</a>) is no longer permitted for 
 functions that have attachments (see <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>).  In such cases, the 
 attachment must be removed first, e.g. with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a> foo nil)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Made small changes to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> in order to 
 permit guard verification of functions introduced with more than one 
 quantified variable in a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> form.  The change to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span> 
 is to weaken the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> by eliminating the requirement that the second 
 argument satisfy <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></span>, and replacing the call of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a></span> in 
 the definition body by a corresponding call of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a></span>.  The new 
 definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span> is thus logically equivalent to the old 
 definition, but with a weaker guard.  Thanks to Sol Swords for sending the 
 following example, for which the final <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> form had failed 
 but now succeeds.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> foo (a b c) nil)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a> forall-a-b-foo (c)
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t :verify-guards nil))
   (<a href="ACL2____FORALL.html">forall</a> (a b) (foo a b c)))
(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> forall-a-b-foo)</pre> 
 
 <p>The implementations of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-GUARD-CHECKING.html">with-guard-checking</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> (and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-BE-EQUAL.html">must-be-equal</a></span>), and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a></span> have changed.  See the discussion below 
 of the new utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span>.  A consequence is that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span> 
 is explicitly disallowed for these and related symbols, which formerly could 
 cause hard Lisp errors, because they are now macros.  Tracing of return-last 
 is also disallowed.  Another consequence is that time$ now prints a more 
 abbreviated message by default, but a version of the old behavior can be 
 obtained with <span class="v">:mintime nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The following utilities no longer print an observation about raw-mode 
 transitions: <span class="v">set-raw-mode-on</span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE-ON_12.html">set-raw-mode-on!</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a></span>, and <span class="v">set-raw-mode-off</span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 suggestion this change in the case of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> (which proved 
 awkward to restrict to that case).</p> 
 
 <p>The system function <span class="v">translate-and-test</span> now permits its <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
 form to refer to the variable <span class="v">WORLD</span>, which is bound to the current ACL2 
 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified abort handling to avoid talking about an interrupt when the error 
 was caused by a Lisp error rather than an interrupt.</p> 
 
 <p>The value of the constant <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>, which is still a list, has 
 been extended significantly, though only with the addition of symbols that one 
 might reasonably have expected all along to belong to this list.  A new 
 distributed book, <span class="v">books/misc/check-acl2-exports.lisp</span>, checks (at 
 certification time) that no documented constant, macro, or function symbol in 
 the <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> package has been accidentally omitted from 
 <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>.  Thanks to Dave Greve for helpful discussions related to 
 this change.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the built-in `<span class="v">untranslate</span>' functions to produce <span class="v">let*</span> 
 expressions when appropriate (more to help with tools that call 
 <span class="v">untranslate</span> and the like, than to help with proof output).</p> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REDO-FLAT.html">redo-flat</a></span> now works for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> failures, 
 just as it continues to work for failures of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The following only affects users who use trust tags to add to list values 
 of either of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> global variables <span class="v">program-fns-with-raw-code</span> 
 or <span class="v">logic-fns-with-raw-code</span>.  For functions that belong to either of the 
 above two lists, <span class="v">trace$</span> will supply a default value of <span class="v">:fncall</span> to 
 keyword <span class="v">:notinline</span>, to avoid discarding raw-Lisp code for the 
 function.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of the macro <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____INTERN.html">intern</a></span> has been strengthened so that 
 its second argument may no longer be either the symbol 
 <span class="v">*main-lisp-package-name*</span> or the string <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span>.  That change 
 supports another change, namely that the following symbols in the 
 <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span> package are no longer allowed into ACL2: symbols in that 
 package that are not members of the list constant 
 <span class="v">*common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*</span> yet are imported into the 
 <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span> package from another package.  See <a href="ACL2____PKG-IMPORTS.html">pkg-imports</a> and 
 see <a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a>.  To see why we made that change, consider for 
 example the following theorem, which ACL2 was able to prove when the host Lisp 
 is GCL.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((x "ALLOCATE") (y 'car))
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a> x)
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> y)
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a> y)
                       "COMMON-LISP"))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a> (<a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a> x y))
                  "SYSTEM")))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now suppose that one includes a book with this theorem (with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> <span class="v">nil</span>), using an ACL2 built on top of a different host Lisp, 
 say CCL, that does not import the symbol <span class="v">SYSTEM::ALLOCATE</span> into the 
 <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span> package.  Then then one can prove <span class="v">nil</span> by giving this 
 theorem as a <span class="v">:use</span> hint.</p> 
 
 <p>The axioms introduced by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> have changed.  See the discussion 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PKG-IMPORTS.html">pkg-imports</a></span> under ``NEW FEATURES'' below.</p> 
 
 <p>The error message for free variables (e.g., in definition bodies and 
 guards) now supplies additional information when there are governing IF 
 conditions.  Thanks to Jared Davis for requesting this enhancement and 
 collaborating in its design.</p> 
 
 <p>The command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REDEF-.html">redef-</a></span> now turns off redefinition.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved proof output in the case of a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a></span> hint 
 that proves the goal, so that the clause-processor function name is 
 printed.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a></span> command `<span class="v">then</span>' now stops at the first 
 failure (if any).</p> 
 
 <p>It is no longer permitted to submit definitions in <span class="v">:logic</span> mode for 
 merely part of an existing <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> event.  Such an action 
 left the user in an odd state and seemed a potential soundness hole.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BREAK_42.html">break$</a></span> is now in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.  Thanks to 
 Jared Davis for requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></span> now provides clearer output in the 
 case that it is redundant.  More important perhaps, as a courtesy it now 
 causes an error when applied to a constrained function, since presumably such 
 an application was unintended (as the constrained function could never have 
 been in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode).  Note that if one desires different 
 behavior, one can create one's own version of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></span> (but 
 with a different name).</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s for the following functions, often weakening 
 them, to reflect more precisely the requirements for calling <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>: 
 <span class="v">alist-difference-eq</span>, <span class="v">intersection-eq</span>, <span class="v">intersection1-eq</span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERSECTP-EQ.html">intersectp-eq</a></span>, <span class="v">not-in-domain-eq</span>, <span class="v">set-difference-assoc-eq</span>, 
 <span class="v">set-equalp-eq</span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNION-EQ.html">union-eq</a></span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for pointing 
 out this issue for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTERSECTP-EQ.html">intersectp-eq</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>(CCL only) Made a change that can reduce the size of a compiled file 
 produced by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> when the host Lisp is CCL, by discarding 
 source information (for example, discarding <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> events).</p> 
 
 <p><b>NEW FEATURES</b></p> 
 
 <p>See the discussion above about new statistics that can be gathered by the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a></span> utility.</p> 
 
 <p>A new hint, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a></span>, allows use of the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> at the level of <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> to the prover.  Thanks to Pete 
 Manolios for requesting this feature (in 2001!).  See <a href="ACL2____INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>(For system hackers) There are new versions of system functions 
 <span class="v">translate1</span> and <span class="v">translate</span>, namely <span class="v">translate1-cmp</span> and 
 <span class="v">translate-cmp</span> respectively, that do not take or return <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>. 
 See the Essay on Context-message Pairs for relevant information.  Thanks to 
 David Rager for collaborating on this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>A new utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span>, is now the unique ACL2 function that 
 can pass back a multiple value result from one of its arguments.  Thus, now 
 the following are macros whose calls ultimately expand to calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span>: <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a></span>, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-GUARD-CHECKING.html">with-guard-checking</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> (and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-BE-EQUAL.html">must-be-equal</a></span>), and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a></span>.  With an active trust tag, an advanced user can now write 
 code that has side effects in raw Lisp; see <a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a>.  Thanks to 
 Jared Davis for requesting this feature.</p> 
 
 <p>A new function, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PKG-IMPORTS.html">pkg-imports</a></span>, specifies the list of symbols imported 
 into a given package.  The axioms for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> have been strengthened, 
 taking advantage of this function.  Now one can prove theorems using ACL2 that 
 we believe could not previously be proved using ACL2, for example the 
 following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a> (<a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a> str t))
       (<a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a> (<a href="ACL2____INTERN-IN-PACKAGE-OF-SYMBOL.html">intern-in-package-of-symbol</a> str nil)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Sol Swords for a helpful report, which included the example 
 above.  See <a href="ACL2____PKG-IMPORTS.html">pkg-imports</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NO-DUPLICATESP-EQ.html">no-duplicatesp-eq</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a new hint keyword, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT-RW.html">backchain-limit-rw</a></span>, to control the 
 level of backchaining for <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>, and <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> 
 rules.  This overrides, for the current goal and (as with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></span> hints) descendant goals, the default <a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> (see 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-backchain-limit</a>).  Thanks to Jared Davis for requesting this 
 feature.</p> 
 
 <p>Support is now provided for creating and certifying books that do not 
 depend on trust tags, in the case that the only use of trust tags is during 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> expansion.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-WRITE-ACL2X.html">set-write-ACL2x</a>.  Thanks to Sol 
 Swords for reporting a couple of bugs in a preliminary implementation.</p> 
 
 <p>Function <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FILE-WRITE-DATE_42.html">file-write-date$</a> filename state)</span> has been added, giving the 
 write date of the given file.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING-REPORTS.html">forward-chaining-reports</a> for how to get new reports on the 
 forward chaining activity occurring in your proof attempts.  Thanks to Dave 
 Greve for inspiring the addition of this utility.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now possible to use ACL2's printing utilities to return strings, by 
 opening output channels to the keyword <span class="v">:STRING</span> rather than to filenames. 
 See <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for a helpful conversation that led us 
 to add this feature.</p> 
 
 <p><b>HEURISTIC IMPROVEMENTS</b></p> 
 
 <p>We have slightly improved the handling of <span class="v">:</span><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> 
 rules that contain free variables.  Formerly, such rules might fire only once, 
 when the first match for a free variable is discovered, and would not fire 
 again even if subsequent forward chaining made available another match.  This 
 made it difficult to predict whether a rule with free variables would fire or 
 not, depending as it did on the order in which newly derived conclusions were 
 added.  The new handling is a little slower but more predictable.  Thanks to 
 Dave Greve for sending a helpful example that led us to consider making such 
 an improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>We have slightly improved the so-called ``<a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a>'' heuristics to 
 work a bit harder on terms of the form <span class="v">(rec term)</span>, where <span class="v">rec</span> is a 
 so-called ``compound-recognizer'' function, that is, a function with a 
 corresponding enabled <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a></span> rule.  Thanks to Jared 
 Davis for sending a helpful example (found, in essence, in the modified 
 function <span class="v">type-set-rec</span>, source file <span class="v">type-set-b.lisp</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>We made three heuristic improvements in the way contexts (so-called 
 ``type-alists'') are computed from goals (``clauses'').  Although these 
 changes did not noticeably affect timing results for the ACL2 regression 
 suite, they can be very helpful for goals with many hypotheses.  Thanks to 
 Dave Greve for sending a useful example (one where we found a goal with 233 
 hypotheses!).</p> 
 
 <p>The algorithm for substituting alists into terms was modified.  This change 
 is unlikely to affect many users, but in one example it resulted in a speed-up 
 of about 21%.  Thanks to Dave Greve for supplying that example.</p> 
 
 <p>Sped up <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> a bit by memoizing checksums of symbols. 
 (This change pertains to ``normal'' ACL2 only, not the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a></span> version 
 (see <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>, where such memoization already occurred.) 
 We found about a 23% speed-up on an example from Dave Greve.</p> 
 
 <p>Made a small change to the algorithm used to prove hypotheses of 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules (ACL2 source function 
 <span class="v">type-set-relieve-hyps</span>).  One change avoids a linear walk through the 
 context (the ``type-alist'' structure), while the other could avoid storing 
 unnecessary <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d assumptions (into the so-called ``tag-tree'').</p> 
 
 <p><b>BUG FIXES</b></p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a long-standing soundness bug caused by the interaction of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d hypotheses with destructor <a href="ACL2____ELIM.html">elim</a>ination.  The fix was to avoid 
 using forcing when building the context (so-called ``type-alist'') when the 
 goal is considered for destructor elimination; those who are interested can 
 see a discussion in source function <span class="v">eliminate-destructors-clause1</span>, which 
 includes a proof of <span class="v">nil</span> that no longer succeeds.  A similar fix was made 
 for generalization, though we have not exploited the previous code to prove 
 <span class="v">nil</span> in that case.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that allowed book certification to ignore <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> 
 around <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  Thus, a book could contain an event 
 of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a> (<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> ...))</span>, and a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> on that book could succeed even without supplying keyword 
 <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp t</span>.  This bug was introduced in Version 3.5 (May, 
 2009).</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that could occur when including a book that attempts to 
 redefine a function as a macro, or vice-versa.  (For details of the issue, see 
 the comment in the definition of variable <span class="v">*hcomp-fn-macro-restore-ht*</span> in 
 source file <span class="v">other-events.lisp</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>(Windows only) Fixed handling of the Windows drive so that an executable 
 image saved on one machine can be used on another, even with a different 
 drive.  Thanks to Harsh Raju Chamarthi for reporting this issue and doing a 
 lot of testing and collaboration to help us get this right.</p> 
 
 <p>Made a change to avoid possible low-level errors, such as bus errors, when 
 quitting ACL2 by calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a></span> or its synonyms.  This was occurring 
 in CCL, and we are grateful to Gary Byers for helping us find the source of 
 those errors (which basically was that ACL2 was attempting to quit while 
 already in the process of quitting).</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-GUARD-CHECKING.html">with-guard-checking</a></span>, which was being ignored in 
 function bodies.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TOP-LEVEL.html">top-level</a></span>, which was not reverting the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> when an error resulted from evaluation of the given form.  Thanks to 
 Jared Davis for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a long-standing bug (back through Version 2.7) that was discarding 
 changes to the connected book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>) when exiting and then 
 re-entering the top-level ACL2 loop (with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span>).</p> 
 
 <p>In some host Lisps, it has been possible to be in a situation where it is 
 impossible to interrupt checkpoint printing during the summary.  We had 
 thought this solved when the host Lisp was CCL, but Sol Swords sent us an 
 example (for which we are grateful) illustrating that this behavior could 
 occur.  This has been fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in a proof obligation generated for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> and 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a></span> rules, that the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> on the 
 metafunction or clause-processor function, <span class="v">fn</span>, holds under suitable 
 assumptions.  Those assumptions include not only that the first argument of 
 <span class="v">fn</span> satisfies <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span>, but also that all <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> inputs 
 satisfy the corresponding stobj recognizer predicates.  We had erroneously 
 considered stobj outputs of <span class="v">fn</span> instead of stobj inputs.  Thanks to Sol 
 Swords for bringing this bug to our attention with a simple example, and 
 correctly pointing us to the bug in our code.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed the following bugs in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a></span>.  We hadn't always been 
 applying the full functional substitution when generating guard proof 
 obligations.  We had been able to hit an assertion when reattaching to more 
 than one function.  Attachment was permitted in the case of an untouchable 
 function (see <a href="ACL2____REMOVE-UNTOUCHABLE.html">remove-untouchable</a>).  Finally, the guard proof obligation 
 could fail in the case that the two functions have different formal parameter 
 lists, as in the following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 ((foo (x) x :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> x)))
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) x)))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> bar (x2)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> x2)))
  x2)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a> foo bar)</pre> 
 
 <p>Fixed a raw Lisp error that could be caused by including a book using 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> to define a function symbol in a locally-introduced 
 package.  An example appears in a comment in ACL2 source function 
 <span class="v">write-expansion-file</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Made a change that can prevent an error near the end of book certification 
 when the underlying Host Lisp is Allegro Common Lisp, in the case that 
 environment variable <span class="v">ACL2_SYSTEM_BOOKS</span> has been set to the name of a 
 directory with a parent that is a soft link.  Thanks to Dave Greve for 
 supplying an example to led us to this fix, which involves avoiding Allegro 
 CL's implementation of the Common Lisp function, <span class="v">truename</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was failing to substitute fully using bindings of free 
 variables in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d hypotheses.  A related change is that instead of 
 binding such a free variable to a new variable of the form <span class="v">???-Y</span>, the new 
 variable is now of the form <span class="v">UNBOUND-FREE-Y</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that could inhibit the printing of certain theory warnings (and 
 probably, in the other direction, cause inappropriate such printing).</p> 
 
 <p>We eliminated excessive <span class="v">"Raw-mode"</span> warnings about <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a></span> that could be generated by the use of raw-mode during 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  Thanks to Dave Greve for bringing this issue to our 
 attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed the printing of results from forms within an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, so 
 that they are abbreviated according to the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-EVISC-TUPLE.html">ld-evisc-tuple</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now possible to evaluate <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>-related forms after evaluating 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span> <span class="v">:none</span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span> <span class="v">nil</span>, even in cases where such evaluation formerly 
 caused a guard violation due to a bug in ACL2.  Here is an example of an error 
 that no longer occurs.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st fld)

Summary
Form:  ( DEFSTOBJ ST ...)
Rules: NIL
Time:  0.00 seconds (prove: 0.00, print: 0.00, other: 0.00)
 ST
ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> :none)

Turning off guard checking entirely.  To allow execution in raw Lisp
for functions with guards other than T, while continuing to mask guard
violations, :SET-GUARD-CHECKING NIL.  See :DOC set-guard-checking.

ACL2 &gt;(fld st)

ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function call (FLD ST),
which is (<a href="ACL2____STP.html">STP</a> ST), is violated by the arguments in the call (FLD ST).
[... etc. ...]</pre> 
 
 <p>You can understand how things now work by imagining that when a function 
 introduced by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> is called, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span>-checking values of 
 <span class="v">:none</span> or <span class="v">nil</span> are temporarily converted to <span class="v">t</span>.  Thanks to Pete 
 Manolios, Ian Johnson, and Harsh Raju Chamarthi for requesting this 
 improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in which the wrong attachment could be made when the same 
 function has an attachment in a book and another in the certification world of 
 that book (possibly even built into ACL2), if the load of a compiled file is 
 aborted because a sub-book's compiled file is missing.  The bug has been 
 present since the time that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a></span> was added (Version_4.0).  An 
 example may be found in a comment in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a></span> for <span class="v">note-4-2</span> 
 (ACL2 source file <span class="v">ld.lisp</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> and related utilities now cause a clean error when 
 provided other than a symbol.  Thanks to Jared Davis for pointing out the raw 
 Lisp error that had occurred in such cases.</p> 
 
 <p>It had been the case that in raw-mode (see <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a>), it was 
 possible to confuse <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> when including a book in a directory 
 different from the current directory.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to Hanbing 
 Liu for bringing this problem to our attention with a small example.</p> 
 
 <p><b>NEW AND UPDATED BOOKS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE</b></p> 
 
 <p>Many changes have been made to the distributed books, thanks to an active 
 ACL2 community.  You can contribute books and obtain updates between ACL2 
 releases by visiting the ACL2 Books web page.  [Note: This release note is 
 obsolete, as it referenced the now-invalid URL, 
 <span class="v">http://acl2-books.googlecode.com/</span>.]</p> 
 
 <p>There is new <span class="v">Makefile</span> support for certifying just some of the 
 distributed books.  See <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION-CLASSIC.html">books-certification-classic</a>, in particular 
 discussion of the variable <span class="v">ACL2_BOOK_DIRS</span>.  Thanks to Sandip Ray for 
 requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> now points to a new book, 
 <span class="v">books/make-event/defrule.lisp</span>, that shows how <span class="v">make-event</span> can be used 
 to do macroexpansion before generating <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  Thanks to Carl Eastlund 
 for useful interaction on the acl2-help mailing list that led us to add this 
 example.</p> 
 
 <p><b>EMACS SUPPORT</b></p> 
 
 <p>Incorporated a version of changes from Jared Davis to the <span class="v">control-t f</span> 
 emacs utility (distributed file <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span>), so that one can 
 fill a format string from anywhere within the string.</p> 
 
 <p><b>EXPERIMENTAL VERSIONS</b></p> 
 
 <p>We refrain from listing changes here to experimental versions, other than 
 an enhancement to the <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a> version that can reduce sizes of <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> files, by applying <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-COPY.html">hons-copy</a></span> to introduce structure 
 sharing (ACL2 source function <span class="v">make-certificate-file1</span>).</p>
