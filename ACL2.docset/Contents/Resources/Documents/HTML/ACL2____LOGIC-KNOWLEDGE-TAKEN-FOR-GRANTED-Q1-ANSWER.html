<p>The inductive step of the <span class="v">rev-rev</span> proof â€” Answer to Question 1</p><p>The correct answer to Question 1 in <a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED.html">logic-knowledge-taken-for-granted</a> is <i>Choice (iv)</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>The Induction Step of the inductive proof of</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> z)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> z)) z))</pre> 
 
 <p>for an induction on the linear list <span class="v">z</span> is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Induction Step</i>: 
(implies (and (not (endp z)) 
              (implies (true-listp (cdr z)) 
                       (equal (rev (rev (cdr z))) (cdr z)))) 
         (implies (true-listp z) 
                  (equal (rev (rev z)) z))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The second hypothesis above is the the <i>induction hypothesis</i>.  The 
 conclusion above is the formula we are trying to prove.  Each induction 
 hypothesis is <i>always</i> an <a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED-INSTANCE.html">instance</a> of the formula 
 being proved, i.e., it is obtained from the formula being proved by uniformly 
 replacing the variables in the formula with terms.  Notice how the induction 
 hypothesis above is the same as the induction conclusion, except that all the 
 <span class="v">z</span>s have been replaced by <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> z)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If you thought the right answer was</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Induction Step -- Choice (i)</i>: 
(implies (not (endp z)) 
         (implies (true-listp z) 
                  (equal (rev (rev z)) z))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>then perhaps you didn't understand that we're doing an inductive proof. 
 Certainly if you prove the Base Case already discussed and you prove <i>Choice 
 (i)</i> above, then you will have proved the goal conjecture, but you would 
 have done it by simple case analysis: prove it when <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> z)</span> and prove it 
 when <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> z))</span>.  While logically valid, you probably can't prove 
 <i>Choice (i)</i> directly because you have no induction hypothesis to work 
 with.</p> 
 
 <p>If you thought the right answer was:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Induction Step -- Choice (ii)</i>: 
(implies (true-listp (cdr z)) 
         (equal (rev (rev (cdr z))) (cdr z))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>then perhaps you misunderstand the difference between the <i>Induction 
 Step</i> and the <i>Induction Hypothesis</i>.  The Induction <i>Step</i> is 
 the ``other half'' of the main proof, balancing the Base Case.  The Induction 
 <i>Hypothesis</i> is just a hypothesis you get to use during the Induction 
 Step.  The question Q1 asked what is the Induction Step.</p> 
 
 <p>If you thought the right answer was:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Induction Step -- Choice (iii)</i>: 
(implies (and (not (endp z)) 
              (equal (rev (rev (cdr x))) (cdr x))) ; <i>``induction hyp''</i> 
         (implies (true-listp z) 
                  (equal (rev (rev z)) z))) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>then you are making the most common mistake newcomers make to induction. 
 You are giving yourself an ``induction hypothesis'' that is not an instance of 
 the conjecture you're proving.  This alleged induction hypothesis says that 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)</span>, whereas the correct induction 
 hypothesis says those two terms are equal <i>if</i> <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))</span>. 
 This alleged induction hypothesis is a stronger claim than we're trying to 
 prove.  It turns out that by making this mistake you can ``prove'' conjectures 
 that are not always true!  Remember: the induction hypothesis is always an 
 instance of the conjecture you're proving, not just some piece of it.  Of 
 course, ACL2 ``knows'' this and will never make this mistake.  But we remind 
 you of it because there may be times when you intuit a different hypothesis 
 and don't understand why ACL2 doesn't use it.</p> 
 
 <p>If this doesn't make sense, perhaps you should read about <a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED-INDUCTIVE-PROOF.html">induction</a> again.</p>
