<p>Applicative "printer" for building strings.</p><p>We implement a printer as a stobj name <a href="VL2014____PS.html">ps</a>, and use it as the 
back-end for formatting our source code and for other output tasks.  Our 
printer is applicative and the act of printing only accumulates characters or 
strings into a list.  These printed elements are kept in reverse order, which 
makes the sequential printing of small chunks of text reasonably 
efficient.</p>
