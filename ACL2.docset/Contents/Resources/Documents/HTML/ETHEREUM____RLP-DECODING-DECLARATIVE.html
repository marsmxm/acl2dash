<p>Declarative definitions of RLP decoding.</p><p>We specify RLP decoding via functions 
     from byte arrays 
     to byte arrays, trees, and scalars. 
     These functions are declaratively defined 
     as inverses of the RLP encoding functions. 
     They are not executable.</p><p>Note that [YP:B] only defines RLP encoding explicitly, not RLP decoding. 
     Clearly, the intention is that decoding is the inverse of encoding: 
     this is the implicit specification of decoding in [YP:B].</p>
