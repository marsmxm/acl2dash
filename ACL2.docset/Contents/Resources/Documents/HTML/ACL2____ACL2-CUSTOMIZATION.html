<p>File of initial commands for ACL2 to run at <a href="ACL2____STARTUP.html">startup</a></p><p>ACL2 provides a mechanism to load automatically a so-called ``ACL2 
 customization file,'' via <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>, the first time <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span> is called in 
 an ACL2 session.  ACL2 looks for this file as follows.</p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li>If the host Lisp reads a non-empty value for the system's 
 environment variable <span class="v">ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION</span>, then that string value is used 
 for the customization file name.  In this case, if the file does not exist or 
 if the string is "NONE" then there is no customization file.  Notes: 
 
     <ul> 
 
     <li>If the customization file name is a relative pathname (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>), then the pathname is considered relative to the connected book 
     directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>).</li> 
 
     <li>If this variable is not already defined, then its value is set to 
     <span class="v">NONE</span> when books are certified using <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> or other, 
     legacy Make-based certification tools.</li> 
 
     </ul>
</li> 
 
 <li>Otherwise (empty environment variable value), file 
 <span class="v">"acl2-customization.lsp"</span> or <span class="v">"acl2-customization.lisp"</span> on the 
 connected book directory (see <a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>), generally the current directory, is 
 the customization file (in that order) if either exists.</li> 
 
 <li>Otherwise file <span class="v">"acl2-customization.lsp"</span> or 
 <span class="v">"acl2-customization.lisp"</span> on your home directory is the customization 
 file (in that order), if either exists (except, this case is skipped on 
 Windows operating systems.</li> 
 
 </ol> 
 
 <p>Except for the fact that this <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> command is not typed explicitly by 
 you, it is a standard <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> command except that any settings of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> specials are remembered once this call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> has completed other 
 than <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-ERROR-ACTION.html">ld-error-action</a></span>, which will always be <span class="v">:command-conventions</span> 
 after that call of <span class="v">ld</span> completes.  For example, suppose that you start 
 your customization file with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">set-ld-skip-proofsp</a> t state)</span>, so that 
 proofs are skipped as it is loaded with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>.  Then the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> 
 special <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> will remain <span class="v">t</span> after the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> has 
 completed, causing proofs to be skipped in your ACL2 session, unless your 
 customization file sets this variable back to <span class="v">nil</span>, say with 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">set-ld-skip-proofsp</a> nil state)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If the customization file exists, it is loaded with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> using the 
 usual default values for the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> specials (see <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a>) except that 
 <span class="v">:ld-error-action</span> is <span class="v">:error</span>.  If an error is encountered, then no 
 subsequent forms in the file will be evaluated and ACL2 will quit 
 immediately.</p> 
 
 <p>To create a customization file it is recommended that you first give it a 
 name other than <span class="v">"acl2-customization.lsp"</span> or 
 <span class="v">"acl2-customization.lisp"</span> so that ACL2 does not try to include it 
 prematurely when you next enter <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span>.  Then, while in the uncustomized 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span>, explicitly invoke <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> on your evolving (but renamed) 
 customization file until all forms are successfully evaluated.  The same 
 procedure is recommended if for some reason ACL2 cannot successfully evaluate 
 all forms in your customization file: temporarily rename your customization 
 file so that ACL2 does not try to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> it automatically and then debug 
 the new file by explicit calls to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>WARNING!  If you certify a book after the (automatic) loading of a 
 customization file, the forms in that file will be part of the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> you certify!  That is, the forms in your 
 customization file at certification time will be loaded whenever anybody uses 
 the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> you are certifying.  Since customization files generally 
 contain idiosyncratic <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s, you may not want yours to be part of 
 the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> you create for others.  Thus, if you have a customization 
 file then you may want to invoke <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span><span class="v"> 1</span> before certifying 
 any <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>; alternatively, see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK_12.html">certify-book!</a> for automatic 
 invocation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>On the other hand, if you wish to prevent undoing commands from the 
 customization file, see <a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that except on Windows-based systems, if there is a file 
 <span class="v">acl2-init.lsp</span> in your home directory, then it will be loaded into raw 
 Lisp when ACL2 is invoked.</p> 
 
 <h3>Silent loading of ACL2 customization files</h3> 
 
 <p>When the environment variable <span class="v">ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION_QUIET</span> is set and not 
 <span class="v">""</span>, there will generally be no output from ACL2 customization.  A 
 special value of <span class="v">"all"</span> for this variable will cause continued minimal 
 output after startup, as explained in the following remark.</p> 
 
 <p>Technical Remark.  For quiet loading of acl2-customization files, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> specials are bound to the following values.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ld-verbose = nil
ld-pre-eval-print = :never
ld-post-eval-print = nil
ld-prompt = nil</pre> 
 
 <p>These <span class="v">ld</span> specials are returned to their normal values after loading an 
 ACL2 customization file, with one exception: if <span class="v">ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION_QUIET</span> 
 has value <span class="v">"ALL"</span> (or <span class="v">"all"</span>; the case is irrelevant), then those 
 values are retained in the ACL2 loop even after customization completes.</p>
