<p>How to proceed when the prover generates a goal of <span class="v">NIL</span></p><p>Failed proofs generally conclude with lists of key 
 checkpoints.  (See <a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a> or <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-KEY-CHECKPOINTS.html">introduction-to-key-checkpoints</a> for an introduction to the notion of ``key 
 checkpoint''.)  These lists may sometimes be annotated as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">[NOTE: A goal of NIL was generated.  See :DOC nil-goal.]</pre> 
 
 <p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic gives some ideas about how to think about 
 the situation described by that message, that is: some goal has reduced to 
 <span class="v">NIL</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose that you see the above NOTE.  If you look at the proof log, you 
 will see a message saying that a goal of <span class="v">NIL</span> has been generated.  This 
 may indicate that the original goal is not a theorem, since most of the 
 prover's activity is typically to replace a goal by an equivalent conjunction 
 of its child subgoals.  However, if some ancestor of the <span class="v">NIL</span> goal has 
 undergone a process other than simplification or destructor elimination 
 — that is, fertilization (heuristic use of equalities), generalization, 
 or elimination of irrelevance — then it is quite possible that the 
 prover got to the <span class="v">NIL</span> goal by replacing a goal by a stronger (and perhaps 
 false) conjunction of child subgoals.</p> 
 
 <p>Let's dig a bit deeper by considering two cases for production of a 
 <span class="v">NIL</span> subgoal.  First consider the case that the subgoal is a key 
 checkpoint at the top level or under a top-level induction — that is, a 
 key checkpoint listed in the proof <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>.  In that case, the original 
 conjecture is very likely not a theorem.  Otherwise, if you are using <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a> (which is the case by default), then you may need to issue the 
 command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a></span> (``Print Saved Output'') to see whether the goal was 
 strengthened from one that was originally a theorem; but here is what may be a 
 better idea.  Instead, it may be best to focus on the key checkpoints printed 
 in the summary to see if they suggest useful <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules to 
 prove.</p> 
 
 <p>If some <span class="v">NIL</span> subgoal is under a key checkpoint at the top level or 
 under a top-level induction, then as discussed above, the original conjecture 
 is probably not a theorem.  Therefore, in that case, ACL2 always prints a 
 <span class="v">NIL</span> subgoal first in a list of checkpoints printed in the <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>, 
 so that a <span class="v">NIL</span> subgoal comes quickly to your attention.</p>
