<p>Set the default well-founded relation</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION.html">set-well-founded-relation</a> lex2)</pre> 
 
 <p>provided <span class="v">lex2</span> has been proved to be a well-founded relation (see <a href="ACL2____WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION-RULE.html">well-founded-relation-rule</a>).  Note: This is an event!  It does not print the 
 usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION.html">set-well-founded-relation</a> rel)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">rel</span> has been proved to be a well-founded relation on objects 
 satisfying some predicate, <span class="v">mp</span>; see <a href="ACL2____WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION-RULE.html">well-founded-relation-rule</a>. 
 This macro is equivalent to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> acl2-defaults-table
 :well-founded-relation 'rel)</span>, and hence is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to any <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> 
 and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in which it occurs; see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>This event sets the default well-founded relation to be that imposed on 
 <span class="v">mp</span>-measures by the relation <span class="v">rel</span>.  Subsequently, if a recursively 
 defined function is submitted to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> with no explicitly given 
 <span class="v">:well-founded-relation</span> argument, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> uses the default relation, 
 <span class="v">rel</span>, and the associated domain predicate <span class="v">mp</span> used in its 
 well-foundedness theorem.  That is, the termination conditions generated will 
 require proving that the measure used by the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> is an 
 <span class="v">mp</span>-measure and that in every recursive call the measure of the arguments 
 decreases according to <span class="v">rel</span>.</p>
