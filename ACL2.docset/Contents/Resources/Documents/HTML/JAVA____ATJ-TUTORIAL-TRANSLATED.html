<p>ATJ tutorial: ACL2 Functions Translated To Java.</p><p>This tutorial page describes 
    which ACL2 functions are translated to Java when ATJ is called, 
    and which requirements these functions must satisfy. 
    This applies to both <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-DEEP-SHALLOW.html">deep and shallow embedding approaches</a>.</p><h5>Target Functions</h5><p>In the factorial function example in <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-DEEP.html">atj-tutorial-deep</a>, 
    ATJ is called with a single target ACL2 function, <span class="v">fact</span>, as argument. 
    As noted in that page, ATJ generates a Java representation 
    not only of the <span class="v">fact</span> function, 
    but also of the functions called by it directly or indirectly, 
    except for the ACL2 primitive functions.</p><p>In general, ATJ may be called with more than one target ACL2 function 
    (with at least one being required):</p><pre class="code">(<a href="JAVA____ATJ.html">java::atj</a> f1 f2 f3 ...)</pre><p>ATJ generates code not only for the functions explicitly given, 
    but also for all the ones called by them directly or indirectly. 
    Normally, ATJ should be called on the top-level function(s) 
    for which Java code must be generated; 
    it is harmless, but unnecessary, 
    to explicitly include non-top-level functions in the ATJ call.</p><h5>Calling Relation</h5><p>We need to be more precise about what 
    `called directly or indirectly' means in this context. 
    ATJ looks at the unnormalized body of each function 
    (i.e. the <span class="v">acl2::unnormalized-body</span> property of the function), 
    which is the result of <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">translating</a> the body of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> that has introduced the function, 
    without any <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZE.html">normalization</a>. As far as ATJ is concerned, 
    a function <span class="v">f</span> directly calls a function <span class="v">g</span> 
    if and only if <span class="v">g</span> occurs in the unnormalized body of <span class="v">f</span>. 
    Then the `indirectly calling' relation is 
    the transitive closure of the `directly calling' relation. 
    (The unnormalized body of a function <span class="v">f</span> 
    can be examined via <span class="v">:props f</span>, or via utilities like 
    <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BODY.html">body</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBODY.html">ubody</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBODY_B2.html">ubody+</a></span>.)</p><p>Note that the guard of <span class="v">f</span> is ignored for the `calling' relation; 
    only the unnormalized body is considered. 
    That is, if the guard of <span class="v">f</span> calls <span class="v">g</span> 
    but the unnormalized body of <span class="v">f</span> does not, 
    then <span class="v">f</span> is not considered to directly call <span class="v">g</span>. 
    It might still call <span class="v">g</span> indirectly, 
    if the unnormalized body of <span class="v">f</span> calls some other function 
    that calls <span class="v">g</span> directly or indirectly, 
    but that has nothing to do with the guard of <span class="v">f</span>. 
    The reason is that currently ATJ does not generate Java code from guards; 
    this may change in the future, and with that the notion of `calling'.</p><p>If <span class="v">f</span> is recursive, 
    the measure of <span class="v">f</span> is also ignored for the `calling' relation. 
    The reason is that measures have really no significance 
    in ACL2's evaluation semantics, 
    other than serving to show that the evaluation of a function terminates.</p><p>If <span class="v">f</span> is a <a href="ACL2____PRIMITIVE.html">primitive function</a>, it has no unnormalized (or normalized) body; 
    it has no definition. 
    Therefore, according to the definition above, 
    <span class="v">f</span> does not call any other function directly, or indirectly.</p><p>If <span class="v">f</span> is a non-primitive function <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-NATIVE-FUNCTIONS.html">natively implemented in Java</a>, ATJ does not look at its unnormalized body. 
    The function is thus regarded, like primitive functions, 
    as not calling any other function directly, or indirectly. 
    (Recall that all primitive functions are natively implemented in Java, 
    but some non-primitive functions are also natively implemented in Java.)</p><h5>Calling Closure</h5><p>At a first approximation, we can say that 
    ATJ calculates the closure of 
    the explicitly supplied target functions <span class="v">f1</span>, <span class="v">f2</span>, etc., 
    with respect to the calling relation defined above. 
    Starting from <span class="v">f1</span>, <span class="v">f2</span>, etc., 
    ATJ finds all the functions called by these directly or indirectly, 
    using a worklist algorithm. 
    When a natively implemnented function is encountered, 
    its called functions are not further explored. 
    Recursive functions, also mutually recursive ones, 
    are handled appropriately (i.e. they do not cause a circular search).</p><p>While calculating this closure, 
    ATJ checks that all the functions in the closure 
    satisfy certain conditions:</p><ul>
<li>Each function must either be primitive or have an unnormalized body. 
     The reason is that, unless the function has a definition 
     or a known behavior (like the primitive functions do), 
     ATJ would not know how to translate the function to Java. 
     (There is actually an exception to this, explained later in this page.)</li>
<li>Each function must have no input or output stobjs. 
     The reason is that stobjs entail side effects, 
     as explained in <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-BACKGROUND.html">atj-tutorial-background</a>, 
     and side effects are not yet supported by ATJ.</li>
<li>Each function must not have raw Lisp code, 
     unless it is in a whitelist of functions with raw Lisp code 
     that are known not to have side effects 
     and are known to behave consistently with their unnormalized body. 
     This whitelist is in the constant <span class="v">*pure-raw-p-whitelist*</span>, 
     used by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PURE-RAW-P.html">pure-raw-p</a></span> utility. 
     The reason for this restriction is that 
     ATJ does not look at the raw Lisp code of those functions, 
     and therefore could not properly translate to Java 
     the code responsible for any side effects.</li>
</ul><p>If any of these conditions is violated, 
    ATJ stops with an error without generating Java code.</p><p>It should be possible to extend the whitelist as needed, 
    and eventually to extend ATJ to accept functions with known side effects, 
    and to generate Java code that suitably replicates those side effects. 
    This is future work.</p><h5>Constrained Functions</h5><p>Besides the primitive functions, 
    the ACL2 constrained functions, 
    introduced via <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, 
    do not have an unnormalized body. 
    As noted above, when ATJ encounters a constrained function, 
    it normally stops with an error without generating any code.</p><p>But there is an exception to this. 
    If a constrained function <span class="v">f</span> 
    with formal parameters <span class="v">x1</span>, ..., <span class="v">xn</span> 
    has an <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">attachment</a> <span class="v">g</span>, 
    then <span class="v">f</span> is treated as if its unnormalized body were 
    <span class="v">(g x1 ... xn)</span>. 
    Thus, <span class="v">f</span> is treated as if it called (directly) <span class="v">g</span>.</p><p>The attachment <span class="v">g</span> of <span class="v">f</span> may be defined, primitive, or constrained. 
    If constrained, ATJ stops without generating code, 
    unless <span class="v">g</span> has an attachment <span class="v">h</span>, 
    in which case <span class="v">g</span> is treated like <span class="v">f</span> above, 
    and then ATJ recursively examines <span class="v">h</span>.</p><h5>Special Treatment of Return-Last</h5><p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> function results from translating 
    macros like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span>. 
    In particular, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a> :logic a :exec b)</span> is translated to 
    <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a> 'acl2::mbe1-raw b a)</span>, 
    and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> a b)</span> is translated to 
    <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a> 'acl2::progn a b)</span>. 
    The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> function has raw Lisp code; 
    its unnormalized body is just its last argument, 
    which does not describe its evaluation semantics 
    (just its logical semantics).</p><p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> function 
    is not in the whitelist mentioned earlier. 
    However, ATJ accepts certain uses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span>: 
    these uses have a known behavior and therefore ATJ 
    knows how to generate correct Java code. 
    (This is not to say that other uses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> 
    do not have a known behavior: 
    all the uses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> have a known behavior, 
    but only some of them are currently supported by ATJ.)</p><p>ATJ accepts calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> of the following forms:</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a> 'acl2::mbe1-raw x y)</span>, 
     i.e. calls whose first argument is the symbol <span class="v">acl2::mbe1-raw</span>. 
     As noted above, these calls result from <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a> :logic y :exec x)</span>. 
     If ATJ's <span class="v">:guards</span> input is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     ATJ treats the call as if it were just <span class="v">y</span>; 
     if instead ATJ's <span class="v">:guards</span> input is <span class="v">t</span>, 
     ATJ treats the call as if it were just <span class="v">x</span>. 
     The reason for this is explained later in more detail 
     in <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-DEEP-GUARDS.html">atj-tutorial-deep-guards</a>. 
     However, the other subterm 
     (i.e. <span class="v">x</span> if <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     and <span class="v">y</span> if <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">t</span>) 
     is not completely ignored: 
     ATJ still checks, recursively, 
     that the functions called directly or indirectly by that subterm 
     are known to be free of side effects. 
     No Java code is generated for these functions 
     (unless they are called directly or indirectly 
     by the subterm of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> for which code is generated, 
     or more in general by the target functions), 
     but ATJ still checks that they have no side effects, 
     to ensure that the generated Java code, which has no side effects, 
     is consistent with the ACL2 evaluation semantics. 
     Note that, even if guards are verified, 
     it is only known that <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span> are logically equal 
     in the context where the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> call appears, 
     but that says nothing about side effects.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a> 'acl2::progn x y)</span>, 
     i.e. calls whose first argument is the symbol <span class="v">acl2::progn</span>. 
     As noted above, these calls result from <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> x y)</span>, 
     which in turn may result from <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_42.html">progn$</a></span> calls. 
     ATJ treats the call as if it were just <span class="v">y</span>, 
     but also checks that <span class="v">x</span> does not call, directly or indirectly, 
     any function that is not known to be free of side effects. 
     The process and the reason are the same 
     as in the <span class="v">acl2::mbe1-raw</span> case. 
     This is independent from the value of ATJ's <span class="v">:guards</span> input.</li>
</ul><p>It should be possible to extend ATJ to accept 
    more forms of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span> calls, 
    and to relax the checks on possibly-side-effecting functions, 
    as also mentioned earlier in this tutorial page. 
    This is future work.</p><h5>Ignoring the Whitelist</h5><p>ATJ provides an optional input <span class="v">:ignore-whitelist</span>. 
    When this input is <span class="v">nil</span> (which is the default), 
    the whitelist mentioned above is not ignored. 
    That is, a function with raw Lisp code must be in the whitelist 
    in order for the ATJ call to succeed, as explained above.</p><p>When <span class="v">:ignore-whitelist</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, the whitelist is ignored instead. 
    So long as a function with raw Lisp code has an unnormalized body, 
    ATJ will translate that unnormalized body to Java code, 
    regardless of whether it is functionally equivalent to the raw Lisp code. 
    In particular, this means that 
    any side effects carried out by the raw Lisp code 
    will not be replicated by the generated Java code. 
    For instance, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HARD-ERROR.html">hard-error</a></span> has <span class="v">'nil</span> as unnormalized body, 
    so the Java code generated for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HARD-ERROR.html">hard-error</a></span> just returns <span class="v">nil</span>: 
    it does not stop execution with an error, as in ACL2.</p><p>There is thus a potential danger of generating incorrect Java code 
    (with respect to a reasonable or expected evaluation semantics of ACL2) 
    when <span class="v">:ignore-whitelist</span> is <span class="v">t</span>. 
    Nonetheless, this option may be useful if, for instance, 
    the ACL2 code that calls the side-effecting functions 
    is unreachable under the guards. 
    In any case, once the user explicitly sets <span class="v">:ignore-whitelist</span> to <span class="v">t</span>, 
    they assume the responsibility for the adequacy of 
    translating side-effecting ACL2 code to non-side-effecting Java code.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Previous:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-SCREEN-OUTPUT.html">Control of the Screen Output</a></p><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-DEEP-GUARDS.html">Guards in the Deep Embedding Approach</a></p>
