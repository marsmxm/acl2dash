<p>''Catch-all'' topic for built-in ACL2 functions</p><p>This <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic is a parent topic under which we 
 include documentation for built-in functions, macros, and special forms that 
 are typically used in <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a>.  For others, including those 
 typically used as top-level commands or those that create <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> 
 (<span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, and so on), documentation 
 may be found as a subtopic of some other parent topic.  We do not document 
 some of the more obscure functions provided by ACL2 that do not correspond to 
 functions of Common Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>If you are already familiar with Common Lisp (or even some other Lisp 
 variant), then you may find it helpful to start with the topic, <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-PROGRAMMING-IN-ACL2-FOR-THOSE-WHO-KNOW-LISP.html">introduction-to-programming-in-ACL2-for-those-who-know-lisp</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>See any documentation for Common Lisp for more details on many of these 
 functions.</p>
