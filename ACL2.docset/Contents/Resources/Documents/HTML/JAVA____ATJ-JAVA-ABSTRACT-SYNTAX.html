<p>An abstract syntax of Java for ATJ's implementation.</p><p>This is not meant as a complete formalization 
     of an abstract syntax for Java. 
     It is just part of the implementation of ATJ, 
     and it suffices for that purpose, 
     namely that ATJ generates this abstract syntax 
     and then pretty-prints it to files. 
     This is why this abstract syntax is under <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/java/atj</span>, 
     not under <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/java/language</span>.</p><p>This abstract syntax may be eventually superseded 
     by a complete formalization under <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/java/language</span>. 
     In fact, we have already started replacing some of this abstract syntax 
     with more complete counterparts from the language formalization, 
     namely the abstract syntax for integer literals.</p><p>The following remarks apply to this ATJ abstract syntax in general, 
     and so they are stated here instead of being repeated in several places:</p><ul>
<li>We do not capture annotations.</li>
<li>We do not explicitly capture parameterized types, type variables, etc. 
      However, since we use arbitrary ACL2 strings for types, 
      <span class="v">&lt;</span> and <span class="v">&gt;</span> may be included as part of these strings.</li>
<li>We use ACL2 strings and characters to capture Java strings and characters, 
      which is more restrictive because ACL2 characters are 8-bit, 
      while Java characters are 16-bit. 
      However, 8-bit characters suffice for ATJ's purposes, 
      which only generates ASCII Java code.</li>
<li>We use ACL2 strings to capture 
      Java identifiers and dot-separated sequenced thereof. 
      On one hand, this is more restrictive 
      because of the 8-bit vs. 16-bit character issue; 
      on the other hand, it is more permissive 
      because it allows characters that are invalid for Java identifiers. 
      However, 8-bit characters suffice for ATJ's purposes, 
      which only generates ASCII Java code. 
      Furthermore, ATJ always does produce ACL2 strings 
      that are valid Java identifiers, or dot-separated sequences thereof.</li>
</ul>
