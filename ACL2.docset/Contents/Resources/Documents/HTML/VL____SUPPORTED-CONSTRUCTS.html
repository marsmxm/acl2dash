<p>Notes about the subset of Verilog and SystemVerilog that <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a> 
  supports.</p><p>VL was originally based on our reading of the <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1364-2005.html" target="_blank"><nobr>Verilog-2005 
standard, IEEE Std 1364-2005<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1364-2005.html"></nobr></a>.  When page and section numbers are used 
throughout the VL documentation, they are often in reference to this document. 
VL now also supports a significant fragment of SystemVerilog, based on our 
reading of the <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1800-2012.html" target="_blank"><nobr>SystemVerilog-2012 
Standard, IEEE 1800-2012<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/1800-2012.html"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
<p>Verilog and SystemVerilog are huge languages.  Accordingly, VL only supports 
a subset of each language.  The precise subset that is supported varies 
depending on the particular <i>flow</i> that you are using.  For instance:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The older <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> flow was developed primarily to handle Verilog-2005 
designs.  It primarily handles RTL-based designs.  It has trouble with 
transistor-level constructs, hierarchical identifiers, inout ports, and fancy 
procedural statements.  It lacks support for most SystemVerilog features.</li> 
 
<li>The newer <a href="ACL2____SV.html">sv</a> flow provides much better support for 
SystemVerilog features like structures, arrays, interfaces, and hierarchical 
identifiers.  It does not currently handle transistor-level constructs or 
simulation constructs like dynamic arrays, tasks, classes, etc.</li> 
 
<li>The <a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl-lint</a> flow can cope with richer SystemVerilog designs.  It is 
not especially bothered by transistor-level constructs.  It cannot handle some 
simulation constructs, but is able to ignore many constructs when it does not 
truly understand them.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Regardless of the particular flow you are using, all VL tools reuse the same 
loader, internal representation of Verilog <a href="VL____SYNTAX.html">syntax</a>.  The loader can read 
files as either Verilog-2005 or SystemVerilog-2012.  Regardless of the input 
type, we arrive at the same internal representation (essentially 
SystemVerilog), and supporting functionality like <a href="VL____MLIB.html">mlib</a> and our <a href="VL____PRINTER.html">printer</a> all work on this same representation.</p> 
 
<p>VL's <a href="VL____PREPROCESSOR.html">preprocessor</a> is somewhat incomplete.  It basically just supports 
<span class="v">`define</span> and <span class="v">`ifdef</span>-related stuff.  It can <span class="v">`include</span> files in the 
style of the <span class="v">+incdir</span> options for tools like Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, and 
VCS.  It also supports a notion of search paths, which are similar to 
<span class="v">+libdir</span> arguments.</p> 
 
<p>The <a href="VL____LEXER.html">lexer</a> is essentially complete.</p> 
 
<p>Regarding Veriog-2005, the <a href="VL____PARSER.html">parser</a> doesn't currently support specify 
blocks and specparams.  In some cases it is smart enough to at least skip over 
the unsupported construct.  Depending on what you are doing, this behavior may 
be actually appropriate (e.g., skipping specify blocks may be okay if you 
aren't trying to deal with low-level timing issues.)</p> 
 
<p>Regarding SystemVerilog-2012, the parser notably lacks support for 
SystemVerilog assertions, classes, configs, and probably many other constructs, 
and many other particular SystemVerilog extensions may not yet be 
implemented.</p> 
 
<p>VL has some ability to tolerate constructs that aren't really supported, and 
the general philsophy is that an error in some particular module shouldn't 
affect other modules.  If the parser runs into an syntax error or an 
unsupported construct, it often only causes that particular module to be 
skipped.  When transforms encounter unsupported things or run into problems, we 
usually avoid hard errors and instead just add "fatal <a href="VL____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a>" to the 
module with the problem.</p>
