<p>Macro to prove and record secondary input and output <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPES.html">types</a> of an ACL2 function.</p><p>This has to be used on the functions of interest 
     (i.e. functions for which we want to generate Java code) 
     prior to calling ATJ, 
     so that ATJ can take advantage of the type information 
     recorded for the functions. 
     This is only relevant 
     when <span class="v">:deep</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">:guards</span> is <span class="v">t</span>; 
     in all other cases, the type information is ignored.</p><p>Each of the successful calls of this macro 
     will result in an overloaded method with the specified types.</p>
