<p>A record of which submodules are to blame for transitive failures to 
  translate modules.</p><h3>Explanation of Blame Alists</h3> 
 
<p>Suppose we are transforming a list of modules, and we run into problems in 
some module, <span class="v">M</span>.  More generally we might run into a problem with a design 
element other than a module, such as an interface, but we'll pretend for the 
moment that there are only modules.</p> 
 
<p>Our basic goal for <a href="VL2014____PROPAGATING-ERRORS.html">propagating-errors</a> is to:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Add a warning onto <span class="v">M</span> that says why we had the problem, and</li> 
<li>Remove <span class="v">M</span> from the list of modules, so that we can continue with the 
other modules.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>But this isn't really good enough.</p> 
 
<p>Besides removing <span class="v">M</span>, we should also remove any dependents (see <a href="VL2014____HIERARCHY.html">hierarchy</a>) of <span class="v">M</span>, since removing <span class="v">M</span> would cause these modules to be 
incomplete.</p> 
 
<p>As we remove these dependent modules, we would also like to annotate them 
with warnings explaining that they are being removed because of problems with 
<span class="v">M</span>.</p> 
 
<p>In general, instead of a single "bad" module, imagine that we have a list 
of bad modules, <span class="v">B1</span>, ..., <span class="v">Bn</span>.  Moreover,</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Let <span class="v">deps(Bi)</span> be the set of all modules that (transitively) depend on 
<span class="v">Bi</span>.</li> 
 
<li>Let <span class="v">D</span> be the union over <span class="v">deps(Bi)</span>, i.e., <span class="v">D</span> is the set of all 
modules that depend on any bad module)</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Note that there is no generally reason to think that <span class="v">deps(Bi)</span> is 
disjoint from <span class="v">deps(Bj)</span>.  If a module <span class="v">M</span> instantiates both <span class="v">Bi</span> and 
<span class="v">Bj</span>, then it will be in the dependents for both of them.  So, which one 
should be blamed?</p> 
 
<p>Our approach is to blame them both.  To do this, we first construct a 
<b>blame alist</b>.</p> 
 
<p>A blame alist includes an entry for every module <span class="v">M</span> in <span class="v">D</span>.  That is, 
it has an entry for every module that is going to be transitively killed.  In 
particular, we want to associate, with each such <span class="v">M</span> with the set of the 
"root problem modules" that it depends on, i.e., with:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">{ Bi : M in deps(Bi) }</pre> 
 
<p>Once the blame alist is constructed, we can easily use it to annotate each 
module in its domain with a warning that says which modules are to blame for 
its removal.</p>
