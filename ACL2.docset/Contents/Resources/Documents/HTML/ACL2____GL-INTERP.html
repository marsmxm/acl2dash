<p>Symbolically interpret a term using GL, with inputs generated by 
parametrization.</p><p>Usage:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____GL-INTERP.html">gl-interp</a> term bindings :hyp hyp)</pre> 
 
<p>The above form runs a symbolic interpretation of <span class="v">term</span> on the symbolic input 
assignment produced by parametrizing <span class="v">bindings</span> using <span class="v">hyp</span>.  The symbolic 
execution run by this form is similar to that run by</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a> &lt;name&gt; :hyp hyp :concl term :g-bindings bindings).</pre> 
 
<p><span class="v">bindings</span> should be a binding list of the same kind as taken by <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a>, that is, a list of elements <span class="v">(var val)</span> such that <span class="v">var</span> is a 
variable free in <span class="v">term</span>, and <span class="v">val</span> is a shape specifier; see <a href="GL____SHAPE-SPECS.html">shape-specs</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Similar to <span class="v">def-gl-thm</span>, <span class="v">term</span> and <span class="v">hyp</span> should be the (unquoted) 
terms of interest, whereas <span class="v">bindings</span> should be something that evaluates to 
the binding list (the quotation of that binding list, for example.)</p> 
 
<p>In more detail: First, the input bindings are converted to an assignment of 
symbolic inputs to variables.  The hyp term is symbolically interpreted using 
this variable assignment, yielding a predicate.  The symbolic input assignment 
is parametrized using this predicate to produce a new such assignment whose 
coverage is restricted to the subset satisfying the hyp.  The term is then 
symbolically interpreted using this assignment, and the result is returned.</p> 
 
<p>This macro expands to a function call taking state and the bvar-db and 
bvar-db1 live stobjs. It returns:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> error-message hyp-bfr param-al result bvar-db bvar-db1 state)</pre> 
 
<p>The symbolic interpreter used by <span class="v">gl-interp</span> is the latest interpreter 
defined using def-gl-clause-processor (as recorded in the 
gl::latest-greatest-gl-clause-proc table).</p>
