<p>If checking is successful, we return an updated variable table 
       and a set of possible termination modes.</p><p>The variable table is updated only via variable declarations, 
       while the other kinds of statements leave the table unchanged. 
       The table may be changed in blocks nested in the statement, 
       but those changes do not surface outside those blocks.</p><p>A block is checked via a separate ACL2 function, 
       which returns a set of modes. 
       These are joined with the starting variable table, 
       which is unchanged as expained above.</p><p>We use separate ACL2 functions to check declarations and assignments, 
       as their checking does not involve the mutual recursion. 
       Declarations and assignments always terminate in regular mode.</p><p>For a function call used as a statement, 
       we check the function call and ensure it returns no results. 
       A function call always terminates in regular mode.</p><p>For an <span class="v">if</span> statement, 
       we check the test, which must return one result, 
       and we check the body block. 
       An <span class="v">if</span> statement may terminate in regular mode 
       (when the test is false) 
       or in any of the modes in which the block may terminate 
       (when the test is true).</p><p>For a <span class="v">for</span> statement, we treat the initialization block specially, 
       because the scope of the initialization block 
       extends to the whole statement, as explained 
       in [Yul: Specification of Yul: Scoping Rules]. 
       We extract the statements from the block 
       and we process them as if they preceded the rest of the <span class="v">for</span>: 
       we collect the function definitions in the statements, 
       and then we check the statements, 
       updating the variable table and obtaining the possible termination modes. 
       We ensure that no termination in <span class="v">break</span> or <span class="v">continue</span> is possible, 
       because that is not allowed, 
       even if the <span class="v">for</span> is in the body of an outer <span class="v">for</span>: 
       the current, innermost <span class="v">for</span> is the one 
       that could be broken or continued, 
       but that can only be done in the body; 
       thus, the initialization block may only terminate 
       in regular or <span class="v">leave</span> mode. 
       We use the updated variable and function tables 
       to check the other components of the <span class="v">for</span>, 
       i.e. test, update block, and body block. 
       We ensure that the update block cannot terminate 
       in <span class="v">break</span> or <span class="v">continue</span> mode, 
       for the same reason explained above for the initialization block, 
       which therefore leaves regular and <span class="v">leave</span> mode 
       as the only termination possibilities for the update block. 
       The body is allowed to terminate in any mode. 
       The possible termination modes of the <span class="v">for</span> loop 
       are determined as follows: 
       regular mode is always possible, 
       which happens when the test is false or if the loop breaks; 
       <span class="v">leave</span> mode is possible when it is possible for any of the 
       initialization, update, or body block; 
       <span class="v">break</span> and <span class="v">continue</span> modes are not possible, 
       because those could only occur in the body, 
       which causes regular loop termination of the loop for <span class="v">break</span> 
       or continuation of the loop for <span class="v">continue</span>.</p><p>For a <span class="v">switch</span> statement, 
       we check the expression, ensuring it returns a single result. 
       We ensure that there is at least one (literal or default) case 
       [Yul: Specification of Yul: Restrictions on the Grammar]. 
       The documentation also requires that the default case be absent 
       when the literal cases are exhaustive; 
       but that requires knowledge of the type of the target expression, 
       which for now we do not have, so we leave out that check for now. 
       We also need to check that all the literals are distinct, 
       which could be taken to mean as 
       either syntactically or semantically distinct: 
       for instance, the literals <span class="v">1</span> and <span class="v">0x1</span> are 
       syntactically different but semantically equal. 
       The Yul team has clarified that it should be semantic difference. 
       For now we check syntactic difference for simplicity, 
       but we plan to tighten that to check semantic difference. 
       Every (literal or default) block is then checked, 
       along with the literals. 
       The possible termination modes are those of the cases 
       and those of the default block.</p><p>The treatment of <span class="v">leave</span>, <span class="v">break</span>, and <span class="v">continue</span> 
       is straightforward: they terminate with the corresponding mode, 
       and the variable table is unchanged.</p><p>For a function definition, the function table is not updated: 
       as explained in <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____ADD-FUNTYPES.html">add-funtypes</a></span>, 
       the function definitions in a block are collected, 
       and used to extend the function table, 
       before processing the statements in a block. 
       The function definition is checked by a separate ACL2 function, 
       which returns nothing in case of success, 
       so here we return the outside variable table unchanged: 
       a function definition does not modify the variable table. 
       At run time, a function definition is essentially a no-op, 
       so the termination mode is always regular.</p>
