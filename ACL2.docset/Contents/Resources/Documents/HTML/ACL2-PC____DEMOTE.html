<p>(primitive) 
move top-level hypotheses to the conclusion</p><pre class="code">Examples:
demote        -- demote all top-level hypotheses
(demote 3 5)  -- demote hypotheses 3 and 5</pre> 
 
 <p>For example, if the top-level hypotheses are <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span> and the 
 conclusion is <span class="v">z</span>, then after execution of <span class="v">demote</span>, the conclusion will 
 be <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> x y) z)</span> and there will be no (top-level) hypotheses.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(demote &amp;rest hyps-indices)</pre> 
 
 <p>Eliminate the indicated (top-level) hypotheses, but replace the conclusion 
 <span class="v">conc</span> with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> hyps conc)</span> where <span class="v">hyps</span> is the conjunction of 
 the hypotheses that were eliminated.  If no arguments are supplied, then all 
 hypotheses are demoted, i.e. <span class="v">demote</span> is the same as <span class="v">(demote 1 2
 ... n)</span> where <span class="v">n</span> is the number of top-level hypotheses.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark</b>: You must be at the top of the conclusion in order to use 
 this command.  Otherwise, first invoke <span class="v">top</span>.  Also, <span class="v">demote</span> fails if 
 there are no top-level hypotheses or if indices are supplied that are out of 
 range.</p>
