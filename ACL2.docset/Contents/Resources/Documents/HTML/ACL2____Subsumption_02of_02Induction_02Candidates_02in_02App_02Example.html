<p>Subsumption of Induction Candidates in App Example</p><p>After collecting induction suggestions from these three terms</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(app <b>a</b> b) 
 
(app <b>b</b> c) 
 
(app <b>a</b> (app b c)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>the system notices that the first and last suggest the same decomposition 
 of <span class="v">a</span>: case split on whether <span class="v">a</span> is empty (i.e., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> a)</span>), and in 
 the case where it is not empty, recursively process <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> a)</span>.  So we are 
 left with two ideas about how to induct:</p> 
 
 <p>Decompose <b>a</b> as we would to unwind (app <b>a</b> b).</p> 
 
 <p>Decompose <b>b</b> as we would to unwind (app <b>b</b> c).</p>
