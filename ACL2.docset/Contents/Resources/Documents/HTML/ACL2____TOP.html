<p><a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/"></nobr></a> is an 
interactive theorem prover.  It combines a Lisp-based programming language for 
developing formal models of systems with a reasoning engine that can prove 
properties about these models.  It has been used to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification" target="_blank"><nobr>formally verify<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification"></nobr></a> 
many <a href="ACL2____INTERESTING-APPLICATIONS.html">interesting systems</a> in 
academia and industry.</p> 
 
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/tree/master/books" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2 Community 
Books<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/tree/master/books"></nobr></a> are the canonical set of open-source libraries ("<a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>") for 
ACL2.  They include lemma libraries for reasoning in many domains, macro 
libraries for more quickly writing and documenting code, interfacing tools for 
connecting ACL2 to other systems, productivity tools for better proof 
automation and debugging, and specialty libraries for areas like <a href="ACL2____HARDWARE-VERIFICATION.html">hardware-verification</a>.</p> 
 
<p>This manual was generated on <b>December 7, 2021 14:47:05</b>.  It covers 
both ACL2 and the Community Books.  It is derived by combining</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>the documentation for the ACL2 system itself—mostly written by Matt 
Kaufmann and J Moore</li> 
 
<li>the documentation for many Community Books—contributed by numerous 
members of the ACL2 community</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Besides just importing the documentation, we also rearrange the topic 
hierarchy to try to provide a coherent organization.</p> 
 
<p>This manual is very much a work in progress.  If you would like to 
contribute to its development, please join the <a href="https://github.com/acl2/" target="_blank"><nobr>acl2 project on GitHub<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/"></nobr></a>!</p>
