<p><span class="v">cert.pl</span> is a mature, user-friendly, industrial-strength tool for 
certifying ACL2 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>For "pure" ACL2 projects—even large ones—<span class="v">cert.pl</span> will let 
you to certify any book, whenever you like, without writing any Makefiles.  If 
your book includes supporting books that aren't certified, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> will 
rebuild exactly the necessary books, in parallel, even if they're in other 
directories.</p> 
 
<p>For more complex projects, where (say) besides just certifying ACL2 books 
you also need to build large C libraries and certify ACL2 books that you're 
generating on the fly, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> can automate the dependency tracking for 
your regular ACL2 books, and you can easily integrate this information into 
your project's <span class="v">Makefile</span>.</p> 
 
<p>For industrial-scale projects, <span class="v">cert.pl</span> has many features that you may 
find valuable.  For instance:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>ACL2 features like packages, ttags, <a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a>, and <a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> images are properly supported.  In particular, 
(<span class="v">.port</span>) files (see <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">ACL2::portcullis</a>) of included books are loaded 
automatically before certification; see <a href="BUILD____PRE-CERTIFY-BOOK-COMMANDS.html">pre-certify-book-commands</a>.</li> 
 
<li>Parallel builds (as in <span class="v">make -j</span>) are well-supported.  For the truly 
adventurous, you may even be able to distribute your build over a cluster.</li> 
 
<li>Tools like <span class="v">critpath.pl</span> can help you to more effectively optimize your 
build time for multi-core environments.</li> 
 
<li>Dependency scanning is cached for better performance on NFS file 
systems.</li> 
 
<li>Ifdef/ifndef constructs are supported for conditional build features -- see 
<a href="ACL2____IFDEF.html">ACL2::ifdef</a>, <a href="ACL2____IFNDEF.html">ACL2::ifndef</a>, <a href="ACL2____IFDEF-DEFINE.html">ACL2::ifdef-define</a>, and <a href="ACL2____IFDEF-UNDEFINE.html">ACL2::ifdef-undefine</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p><span class="v">cert.pl</span> was originally developed in 2008 by Sol Swords at <a href="http://www.centtech.com/" target="_blank"><nobr>Centaur Technology<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.centtech.com/"></nobr></a>, and has been actively 
used and improved since then.  It is now distributed in the <span class="v">build</span> 
directory of the Community Books, and is today the main tool behind 
<span class="v">books/GNUmakefile</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Using <span class="v">cert.pl</span>
</h3> 
 
<p>This documentation is really a <b>tutorial</b>, not a reference.  We 
recommend that you read the topics in order.  Also see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION.html">ACL2::books-certification</a> for additional information on how to automate the 
certification of the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>, and for more details, execute the 
following command in the shell.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">&lt;path_to_acl2&gt;/books/build/cert.pl --help</pre> 
 
<p>We assume basic familiarity with a Unix environment, e.g., we expect that 
you know how to edit your startup scripts to set up a <span class="v">PATH</span>, create 
symbolic links, etc.</p>
