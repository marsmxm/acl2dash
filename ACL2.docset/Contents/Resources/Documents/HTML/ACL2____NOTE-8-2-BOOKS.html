<p>Release notes for the ACL2 Community Books for ACL2 8.2</p><p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> between the releases of ACL2 8.1 and 8.2.</p> 
 
 <p>See also <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-2.html">note-8-2</a> for the changes made to ACL2 itself.  For 
 additional details, you may also see the raw <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master" target="_blank"><nobr>commit log<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>New Libraries</h3> 
 
 <h4>Kestrel Alist Utilities</h4> 
 
 <p>Added an operation <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-ASSOCS.html">remove-assocs</a></span>, which generalizes <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-ASSOC.html">remove-assoc</a></span> from single keys to lists of keys.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="CRYPTO____CRYPTOGRAPHY.html">Cryptography</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Started a library with placeholders for cryptographic functions that will 
 be eventually replaced with complete specifications of those functions.</p> 
 
 <h4>Declarative Definitions of Maxima</h4> 
 
 <p>Added a macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFMAX-NAT.html">defmax-nat</a></span> to declaratively define the maximum of a 
 set of natural numbers.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____EVENT-MACROS.html">Event Macros</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Started a library of concepts and utilities to develop event 
 macros (i.e. macros at the event level) more quickly and consistently.</p> 
 
 <p>This library includes some XDOC constructor utilities for the reference 
 documentation of event macros.</p> 
 
 <p>This library also includes functions to process inputs common to multiple 
 event macros.</p> 
 
 <h4>Graphviz</h4> 
 
 <p>Added a book <span class="v">[books]/centaur/misc/graphviz.lisp</span> defining a syntax tree 
 for the Graphviz <span class="v">.dot</span> file syntax and a printer for that syntax.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="IRV____INSTANT-RUNOFF-VOTING.html">Instant Run-Off Voting</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Formalized an instant run-off voting scheme and proved that it 
 meets certain fairness criteria.</p> 
 
 <h4>Integer Arithmetic</h4> 
 
 <p>A library for integer arithmetic has been added at 
 <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/integer-arithmetic</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="JAVA____JAVA.html">Java</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added a library for Java-related formalizations and tools, including:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<a href="JAVA____AIJ.html">AIJ (<b>A</b>CL2 <b>I</b>n 
 <b>J</b>ava)</a>, a deep embedding in Java of an executable, 
 side-effect-free, non-stobj-accessing subset of the ACL2 language without 
 guards.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="JAVA____ATJ.html">ATJ (<b>A</b>CL2 <b>T</b>o 
 <b>J</b>ava)</a>, a simple Java code generator that turns ACL2 functions 
 into AIJ representations that are evaluated by the AIJ interpreter.</li> 
 
 <li>A <a href="JAVA____LANGUAGE.html">formalization</a> in ACL2 of some 
 aspects of the Java language.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h4><a href="OMAP____OMAPS.html">Omaps</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added a library for omaps (ordered maps), analogous to <a href="ACL2____STD_F2OSETS.html">Std/osets</a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes to Existing Libraries</h3> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">Aignet library</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Improved the <a href="AIGNET____CONSTPROP.html">aignet::constprop</a> transform so that it canonicalizes 
 inputs known to be equivalent or opposite to each other, not just to 
 constants.  Added <a href="AIGNET____OBS-CONSTPROP.html">aignet::obs-constprop</a> that combines this 
 with the existing observability transform, which works better than running 
 the two transforms separately.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Slightly extended the applicability of the <span class="tt"><a href="APT____TAILREC.html">apt::tailrec</a></span> 
 transformation, by relaxing a requirement on the function to be 
 transformed.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved and extended some documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>Added some XDOC constructor utilities tailored to APT transformations.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="BITCOIN____BITCOIN.html">Bitcoin</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Replaced uses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8.html">ubyte8</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8-LIST.html">ubyte8-list</a></span> with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____BYTE.html">byte</a></span> 
 and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LIST.html">byte-list</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Moved the previous placeholders for cryptographic functions into <a href="CRYPTO____CRYPTOGRAPHY.html">a new library</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a formalization of BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Proposal) 32, 39, 43, 
 and 44 for hierarchical deterministic wallets.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the existing documentation.</p> 
 
 <h4>Bytes</h4>

 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-LISTP.html">signed-byte-listp</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">Define</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added support for configuration objects that can be used to specify some 
 extended options.  Also added support for <span class="v">:verify-guards :after-returns</span> 
 that indicates that guards are to be verified after the returns 
 specifiers.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____DEFRSTOBJ.html">Defrstobj</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added support for defining universal accessor and updater functions.</p> 
 
 <h4>Digits in Arbitrary Bases</h4> 
 
 <p>The files <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/digits-any-base*.lisp</span> have been 
 moved to a new subdirectory <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/digits-any-base/</span> 
 and renamed.  Some files have been refactored into smaller files.</p> 
 
 <p>Some theorems have been added.</p> 
 
 <p>Added operations to group digits in a smaller base into digits in a larger 
 base, and vice versa, in both big-endian and little-endian.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro to generate additional return types for conversions from natural 
 numbers to digits has been generalized and renamed.</p> 
 
 <p>A macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFDIGITS.html">defdigits</a></span> has been added, to generate specialized versions 
 of the conversion operations, and some theorems about them, for specific bases 
 and specific recognizers and fixers of (lists of) digits.  Used this macro for 
 some library fixtypes (e.g. bits and bytes as digits in base 2 and 256 
 respectively).</p> 
 
 <p>A macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFDIGIT-GROUPING.html">defdigit-grouping</a></span> has been added, to generate specialized 
 versions of the digit grouping functions, and some theorems about them, for 
 specific pair of bases such that the larger base is a positive power, greater 
 than 1, of the smaller base.  Used this macro for some library fixtypes 
 (e.g. to convert between bits and bytes).</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____ERROR-CHECKING.html">Error-Checking Utilities</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added more error-checking functions.</p> 
 
 <p>The files <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/error-checking*.lisp</span> have been 
 moved to a new subdirectory <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/error-checking/</span> 
 and renamed.  Some files have been refactored into smaller files.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ETHEREUM____ETHEREUM.html">Ethereum</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Replaced uses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8.html">ubyte8</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8-LIST.html">ubyte8-list</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE4.html">ubyte4</a></span>, and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE4-LIST.html">ubyte4-list</a></span> with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____BYTE.html">byte</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LIST.html">byte-list</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NIBBLE.html">nibble</a></span>, and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NIBBLE-LIST.html">nibble-list</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified the formalizations of RLP encoding and decoding to return an 
 explicit error flag.  Added theorems showing that RLP encodings are decodable: 
 RLP encoding is injective, and no valid encoding is a strict prefix of another 
 one.  Added executable RLP decoders and proved them correct with respect to 
 the ones declaratively defined as inverses of the RLP encoders.  Added the RLP 
 tests from the Ethereum Wiki's page on RLP.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a formalization of hex-prefix decoding, declaratively defined as the 
 inverse of hex-prefix encoding.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a formalization of Modified Merkle Patricia trees.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a formalization of the database that underlies Modified Merkle 
 Patricia trees.  This database is a finite map from Keccak-256 
 hashes (i.e. byte arrays of length 32) to byte arrays.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a formalization of the format of transactions and of their RLP 
 encoding and decoding.</p> 
 
 <p>Added several other theorems.  Improved some existing theorems.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved some documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>Moved the previous placeholders for cryptographic functions into <a href="CRYPTO____CRYPTOGRAPHY.html">a new library</a>.</p> 
 
 <h4>Filesystem Books</h4> 
 
 <p>The filesystem books <span class="v">[books]/projects/filesystems/</span> have been 
 substantially expanded; in particular, they now contain a new model which 
 faithfully represents the state of a FAT32 disk image. More details about this 
 work are available in the paper <i>Formalising Filesystems in the ACL2 Theorem 
 Prover: an Application to FAT32</i>, to appear in the proceedings of 
 ACL2-2018.</p> 
 
 <p>Recent improvements to the filesystem books include proofs of correctness of 
 filesystem representation transformations in terms of invertibility, and an 
 expanded set of POSIX system calls verified through refinement.</p> 
 
 <h4>FTY Type Definition Library</h4> 
 
 <p>Added an option <span class="v">:non-emptyp</span> to <span class="v">fty::deflist</span> and <span class="v">std::deflist</span> 
 to define list types that must contain at least one element.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a book <span class="v">[books]/centaur/fty/typegraph.lisp</span> containing a utility that 
 writes a Graphviz <span class="v">.dot</span> file showing an FTY type hierarchy.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a book <span class="v">[books]/clause-processors/pseudo-term-fty</span> that supports 
 for treating pseudo-terms as an FTY sum-of-products type; see <a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-FTY.html">pseudo-term-fty</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Collected several <a href="FTY____FTY-EXTENSIONS.html">FTY 
 extensions</a> under the <a href="ACL2____KESTREL-BOOKS.html">Kestrel 
 Books</a>:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>A new macro <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFLIST-OF-LEN.html">fty::deflist-of-len</a></span> that generates fixtypes for lists 
 of specified lengths, based on existing fixtypes of lists of arbitrary 
 lenghts (introduced via <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFLIST.html">fty::deflist</a></span>).</li> 
 
 <li>A new macro <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFSET.html">fty::defset</a></span> that generates fixtypes for <a href="ACL2____STD_F2OSETS.html">Std/osets</a> with elements of specified fixtypes.  This is analogous to <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFLIST.html">fty::deflist</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFALIST.html">fty::defalist</a></span>.</li> 
 
 <li>A new macro <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFOMAP.html">fty::defomap</a></span> that generates fixtypes for <a href="OMAP____OMAPS.html">omaps</a> with keys and values of specified 
 fixtypes.  This is analogous to <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFLIST.html">fty::deflist</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFALIST.html">fty::defalist</a></span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">acl2::defbyte</span> macro, which generated fixtypes and additional 
 theorems for both bytes and lists of bytes, has been split into two macros 
 <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFBYTE.html">fty::defbyte</a></span>, which generates a fixtype and some additional theorems 
 for bytes, and <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFBYTELIST.html">fty::defbytelist</a></span>, which generates a fixtype and some 
 additional theorems for lists of byte.</li> 
 
 <li>A new macro <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFIXTYPE-ALIAS.html">fty::deffixtype-alias</a></span> to introduce an ``alias'' of an 
 existing fixtype, as well as of its recognizer, fixer, and equivalence.</li> 
 
 <li>An existing fixtype <span class="tt"><a href="OMAP____MAP.html">omap::map</a></span> for <a href="OMAP____OMAPS.html">omaps</a> with keys and values of any types.</li> 
 
 <li>An existing fixtype <span class="tt"><a href="SET____SET.html">set::set</a></span> for <a href="ACL2____STD_F2OSETS.html">Std/osets</a> with elements 
 of any types.</li> 
 
 <li>An existing fixtype <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATI.html">nati</a></span> for natural numbers and infinity.</li> 
 
 <li>New fixtypes <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____BYTE.html">byte</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LIST.html">byte-list</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LIST20.html">byte-list20</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LIST32.html">byte-list32</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTE-LIST64.html">byte-list64</a></span> for (unsigned 8-bit) bytes, true lists 
 of bytes, and true lists of 20, 32, and 64 bytes.</li> 
 
 <li>New fixtypes <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NIBBLE.html">nibble</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NIBBLE-LIST.html">nibble-list</a></span> for (unsigned 4-bit) 
 nibbles and true lists of nibbles.</li> 
 
 <li>A new fixtype <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BIT-LIST.html">bit-list</a></span> for true lists of bits.</li> 
 
 <li>Existing fixtypes <span class="v">ubyteN</span>, <span class="v">sbyteN</span>, <span class="v">ubyteN-list</span>, and 
 <span class="v">sbyteN-list</span> for standard(ly named) fixtypes for unsigned or signed (true 
 lists of) bytes of various sizes.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h4><a href="IPASIR____IPASIR.html">Ipasir library</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Used new ACL2 system features to fix the remaining known soundness bug and 
 remove a trust tag.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____LIST-UTILITIES.html">List Utilities</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added some theorems about functions on lists.</p> 
 
 <h4>Profiling</h4> 
 
 <p>Attempts to run <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ACL2.html">profile-ACL2</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ALL.html">profile-all</a></span> had failed, for 
 ACL2 built on SBCL, with an obscure SBCL error message.  Now, the error 
 message gives instructions for how to avoid the error by rebuilding SBCL from 
 sources after doing a specified edit.  Thanks to Stas Boukarev for pointing to 
 the appropriate SBCL source code line.</p> 
 
 <h4>Quadratic Reciprocity</h4> 
 
 <p>In <span class="v">projects/quadratic-reciprocity/</span>, certain include-books, namely 
 those that bring in books from <span class="v">support/</span>, have been made local.  This follows 
 the standard pattern of putting all proof work in separate "support books" 
 which are included only locally in the main files.  (The main files simply 
 re-iterate, redundantly, the events to be exported.)  If this change causes 
 proof failures, and your development includes books such as 
 <span class="v">projects/quadratic-reciprocity/fermat</span>, consider now also including the 
 corresponding support books (e.g., 
 <span class="v">projects/quadratic-reciprocity/support/fermat</span>).  (Actually, to get 
 broken proofs working again, it may suffice to include simpler books that were 
 previously brought in via the support books, such as 
 <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/basic</span> or <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/util</span>.)</p> 
 
 <h4>RAC: Restricted Algorithmic C</h4> 
 
 <p>Minor modifications of <span class="v">projects/rac/</span> include a bug fix in the parser 
 and a rewrite of <span class="v">examples/hello.cpp</span> 
 (hat-tip to D. Hardin).</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____RTL.html">Rtl</a></h4> 
 
 <p>A number of new lemmas have been added to <span class="v">rtl/rel11/lib/</span>, which were 
 required in the verification of an Arm FPU currently under development.  This 
 in turn required some minor modifications of <span class="v">projects/arm/*/</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="SOFT____SOFT.html">SOFT</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFUN2.html">soft::defun2</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFCHOOSE2.html">soft::defchoose2</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFUN-SK2.html">soft::defun-sk2</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFUN-INST.html">soft::defun-inst</a></span> macros no longer include an 
 explicit list of function parameters.  The function is implicitly 
 parameterized over the function variables that it depends on.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2ALISTS.html">Std/alists</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added a function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-ASSOCS.html">remove-assocs</a></span>, moved from 
 <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added some theorems about <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">remove-assoc-equal</a></span>, moved from 
 <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2BASIC.html">Std/basic</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added a recognizer <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTEP.html">bytep</a></span> for ``standard'' (i.e. unsigned 8-bit) 
 bytes, moved from <a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">Std/io</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a recognizer <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NIBBLEP.html">nibblep</a></span> for ``standard'' (i.e. unsigned 4-bit) 
 nibbles, moved from 
 <span class="v">[books]/projects/oracle/stv-invariant-extraction-pitfall/alu.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">Std/io</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added new lemmas to the <a href="ACL2____COMBINE-FUNCTIONS.html">Std/io 
 byte-combining libraries</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Factored out the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTEP.html">bytep</a></span> predicate into a new file under <a href="ACL2____STD_F2BASIC.html">Std/basic</a>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2LISTS.html">Std/lists</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The definition of function <a href="ACL2____LIST-FIX.html">list-fix</a> from 
 <span class="v">"books/std/lists/list-fix.lisp"</span> has been incorporated into the ACL2 
 sources in a way that minimizes changes to existing books.  See <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-2.html">note-8-2</a> for details.</p> 
 
 <p>The built-in function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TAKE.html">take</a></span> has been redefined exactly along the 
 lines suggested by the theorem <span class="v">take-redefinition</span> that was previously 
 introduced in <span class="v">"books/std/lists/take.lisp"</span>.  This theorem has been now 
 removed.  See <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-2.html">note-8-2</a> for details.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2UTIL.html">Std/util</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added macros <span class="tt"><a href="STD____DEFTHM-NATP.html">std::defthm-natp</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="STD____DEFTHM-UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">std::defthm-unsigned-byte-p</a></span>, 
 and <span class="tt"><a href="STD____DEFTHM-SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">std::defthm-signed-byte-p</a></span>, from the X86ISA model.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STRING-UTILITIES.html">String Utilities</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Added new lemmas and generalized and improved some existing lemmas.</p> 
 
 <p>Redefined more compactly the predicates in 
 <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/string/char-kinds.lisp</span> via <span class="tt"><a href="STR____DEFCHARSET.html">str::defcharset</a></span>.  Added a new predicate.</p> 
 
 <p>Added functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HEXCHARS_D3_E3UBYTE8.html">hexchars=&gt;ubyte8</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8_D3_E3HEXCHARS.html">ubyte8=&gt;hexchars</a></span> to 
 convert between single bytes and pairs of hexadecimal digit characters; 
 rephrased <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8S_D3_E3HEXCHARS.html">ubyte8s=&gt;hexchars</a></span> in terms of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8_D3_E3HEXCHARS.html">ubyte8=&gt;hexchars</a></span>. 
 Added functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HEXCHARS_D3_E3UBYTE8S.html">hexchars=&gt;ubyte8s</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HEXSTRING_D3_E3UBYTE8S.html">hexstring=&gt;ubyte8s</a></span>, 
 inverses of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8S_D3_E3HEXCHARS.html">ubyte8s=&gt;hexchars</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBYTE8S_D3_E3HEXSTRING.html">ubyte8s=&gt;hexstring</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <h4>System Utilities</h4> 
 
 <p>The new utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SUBLIS-EXPR_B2.html">sublis-expr+</a></span> replaces terms by variables even 
 inside <span class="v">lambda</span> (<span class="v">let</span>) bodies.</p> 
 
 <p>Several files <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/*.lisp</span> that contain system 
 utilities have been moved to the subdirectory 
 <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/system/</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DIRECTED-UNTRANSLATE.html">directed-untranslate</a></span>, has been improved in several 
 ways, including more complete handling of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGN_42.html">progn$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>For the event macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ORELSE_A2.html">orelse*</a></span>, the default for the <span class="v">:expansion?p</span> 
 argument has been changed from <span class="v">nil</span> to <span class="v">t</span>, for consistency with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ORELSE.html">orelse</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added utilities <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MACRO-KEYWORD-ARGS.html">macro-keyword-args</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MACRO-KEYWORD-ARGS_B2.html">macro-keyword-args+</a></span> 
 to retrieve an alist of the keyword arguments of a macro, associated to their 
 default values.</p> 
 
 <p>The file <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/system/event-forms.lisp</span> has been split, 
 with material on lists of event forms put into the new file 
 <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/system/event-form-lists.lisp</span>.  When <span class="v">event-forms</span> is 
 included, <span class="tt"><a href="STD____DEFLIST.html">std::deflist</a></span> is now no longer brought in, so 
 <span class="v">std/util/deflist</span> may now need to be explicitly included in more 
 places.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____USE-TERMHINT.html">Termhint utility</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">use-termhint</span> utility has been moved to its own book 
 <span class="v">std/util/termhints</span> from its former location at 
 <span class="v">clause-processors/use-by-hint</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a new utility, <a href="ACL2____FUNCTION-TERMHINT.html">function-termhint</a>, for creating termhints from 
 existing function definitions containing <a href="ACL2____HINTCONTEXT.html">hintcontext</a> annotations.</p> 
 
 <h4>Typed List Utilities</h4> 
 
 <p>Refactored the old file 
 <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/typed-list-theorems.lisp</span> into separate files 
 under a new directory <span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/typed-lists</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a recognizer <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BIT-LISTP.html">bit-listp</a></span> for true lists of bits, and associated 
 theorems.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____X86ISA.html">X86ISA</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Finished adding support for 32-bit application-level execution for all the 
 instructions, including the floating-point ones, supported by the model.</p> 
 
 <p>Added support for enabling/disabling machine features that depend on CPUID 
 flags.</p> 
 
 <p>Detection of many decode-time exceptions is now done during opcode 
 dispatch, as opposed to inside the instruction semantic functions.  This not 
 only lets us catch exceptions early, but also allows us to specify them 
 even if the semantic functions themselves are missing.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved incrementing and decrementing of the stack pointer to be modular: 
 64, 32, or 16 bits, based on the current mode and on the SS.B bit of the 
 current stack segment.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified the logical definitions of the x86 state (i.e., the abstract 
 stobj).  Now, the x86 state accessor functions unconditionally return 
 well-formed values and the x86 state updater functions return a well-formed 
 state, provided that the initial state was well-formed; thus, constraints on 
 the index (in case of array fields) and value being written have been 
 eliminated.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the <span class="v">defthm-natp</span>, <span class="v">defthm-usb</span>, and <span class="v">defthm-sb</span> 
 utilities to generate minimal and reliable hints for corollaries.  Improved 
 the <span class="v">defthm-natp</span> utility to also generate a rewrite rule.  Extended 
 <span class="v">defthm-natp</span> with the ability to turn on/off the generation of the type 
 and linear corollaries, to modify their hypotheses, to supply more specific 
 hints for the corollaries, and to specify <span class="v">:otf-flg</span>; these options are 
 like the ones provided by <span class="v">defthm-usb</span> and <span class="v">defthm-sb</span>.  Improved the 
 <span class="v">defthm-usb</span> utility to also generate a linear linear saying that the value 
 is greater than or equal to 0.  Renamed <span class="v">defthm-usb</span> and <span class="v">defthm-sb</span> to 
 <span class="v">defthm-unsigned-byte-p</span> and <span class="v">defthm-signed-byte-p</span>, for consistency 
 with <span class="v">defthm-natp</span>.  Moved all three utilities to <a href="ACL2____STD_F2UTIL.html">Std/util</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended top-level memory reading functions to take into account the R bit 
 of code segment descriptors, when they access for reading (not execution) a 
 code segment in 32-bit mode: in this case, if R = 0, the code segment is 
 execute-only and thus reading data from it is not allowed.  Extended top-level 
 memory functions to take into account the W bit of data segment descriptors, 
 in 32-bit mode: if W = 0, the data segment is read-only and thus writing data 
 to it is not allowed; writing to a code segment is not allowed either.</p> 
 
 <p>Opcode maps are now represented using <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>s, which makes it 
 easier to operate on them in order to automatically generate dispatch 
 functions and documentation, and to precompute some kinds of decoding 
 information.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended effective-to-linear address translation to check that the visible 
 part of the DS, ES, FS, and GS segment registers does not contain a null 
 segment selector.  A similar check on CS and SS is not needed because a null 
 segment selector cannot be loaded into these two segment registers.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the `PUSH segment register' instruction to handle a 32-bit operand 
 size as in modern processors: instead of zero-extending the 16-bit content of 
 the segment register to 32 bits, now the model writes the low 16 bits, leaving 
 the high 16 bits unchanged.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended <span class="tt"><a href="X86ISA____SELECT-OPERAND-SIZE.html">x86isa::select-operand-size</a></span> to accommodate instructions 
 that do not follow the ``normal'' rules.  The extended function has additional 
 parameters, whose different values trigger the use of the non-``normal'' 
 rules.  Now many more instructions use this function, avoiding repeated blocks 
 of identical codes in their semantic functions.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved and extended some documentation.</p> 
 
 <h4>XDOC Utilities</h4> 
 
 <p>Improved the <a href="XDOC____CONSTRUCTORS.html">XDOC constructors</a> 
 to use a tree representation that is converted into a flat string only at the 
 top level.  This enforces a better type discipline and facilitates future 
 optimizations if needed.</p> 
 
 <p>Introduced several additional constructors.</p> 
 
 <p>Extended the documentation of the constructors.</p> 
 
 <p>Moved the constructors to <span class="v">[books]/xdoc/constructors.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3> 
 
 <h3>Build System Updates</h3> 
 
 <p>Added a feature to <span class="v">books/GNUMakefile</span> that allows books to specify 
 dependencies on cert ACL2 system features, so that they will be automatically 
 be recertified when such features are changed.  See <a href="BUILD____ACL2-SYSTEM-FEATURE-DEPENDENCIES.html">build::ACL2-system-feature-dependencies</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added utilities <a href="ACL2____IFDEF-DEFINE.html">ifdef-define</a> and <a href="ACL2____IFDEF-UNDEFINE.html">ifdef-undefine</a> in 
 <span class="v">books/build/ifdef.lisp</span> which set or unset environment variables while 
 allowing the build system to correctly track them for its support of <a href="ACL2____IFDEF.html">ifdef</a> and <a href="ACL2____IFNDEF.html">ifndef</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Cleaned up the Perl scripts implementing <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">cert.pl</a>, 
 factoring them into several supporting libraries.</p> 
 
 <h3>Testing</h3> 
 
 <h3>Miscellaneous</h3> 
 
 <p>We now avoid causing an error when building the manual in the case that the 
 <span class="v">zip</span> program is not installed; that causes a warning instead.</p>
