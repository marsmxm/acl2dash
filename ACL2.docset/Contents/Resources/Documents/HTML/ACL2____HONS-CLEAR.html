<p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HONS-CLEAR.html">hons-clear</a> gc)</span> is a drastic garbage collection mechanism that 
clears out the underlying Hons Space.</p><p>Logically, <span class="v">hons-clear</span> just returns nil; we leave it enabled 
 and would think it odd to ever prove a theorem about it.</p> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, <span class="v">hons-clear</span> brutally (1) clears all the tables that 
 govern which conses are <a href="ACL2____NORMED.html">normed</a>, then (2) optionally garbage collects, 
 per the <span class="v">gc</span> argument, then finally (3) re-norms the keys of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FAST-ALISTS.html">fast-alists</a></span> and persistently normed conses; see <a href="ACL2____HONS-COPY-PERSISTENT.html">hons-copy-persistent</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Notes.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The hash tables making up the Hons Space retain their sizes after being 
 cleared.  If you want to shrink them, see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-RESIZE.html">hons-resize</a></span>.</li> 
 
 <li>CCL and GCL users might prefer <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-WASH.html">hons-wash</a></span>, which is relatively 
 efficient and allows for the garbage collection of normed conses without 
 impacting their normed status.</li> 
 
 <li>It is not recommended to interrupt this function.  Doing so may cause 
 persistently normed conses and fast alist keys to become un-normed, which 
 might lead to less efficient re-norming and/or violations of the fast-alist 
 discipline.</li> 
 
 <li>(For ACL2(p) users only; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>) If parallel execution is 
 enabled (see <a href="ACL2____SET-PARALLEL-EXECUTION.html">set-parallel-execution</a>), as it is by default in ACL2(p), 
 then <span class="v">hons-clear</span> may be a no-op (other than to print a warning), in order 
 to avoid thread-unsafe behavior.  (However, In CCL you are unlikely to see 
 this restriction unless you are running more than one thread.)  To get around 
 this restriction, you can instead use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-CLEAR_12.html">hons-clear!</a></span>, which however 
 requires a <a href="ACL2____TRUST-TAG.html">trust-tag</a>.</li>
