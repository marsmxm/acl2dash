<p>Routines to encode HTML entities, e.g., <span class="v">&lt;</span> becomes <span class="v">&amp;lt;</span>.</p><p>In principle, our conversion routines may not be entirely 
legitimate in the sense of some precise HTML specification, because we do not 
account for non-printable characters or other similarly unlikely garbage in the 
input.  But it seems like what we implement is pretty reasonable, and handles 
most ordinary characters.</p> 
 
<p>Note that we convert <span class="v">#\Newline</span> characters into the sequence 
<span class="v">&lt;br/&gt;#\Newline</span>.  This may not be the desired behavior in certain 
applications, but seems basically reasonable for converting plain text into 
HTML.</p>
