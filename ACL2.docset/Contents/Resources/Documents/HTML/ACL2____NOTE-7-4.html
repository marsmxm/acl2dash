<p>ACL2 Version  7.4 (March, 2017) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we roughly organize the changes to ACL2 since Version 7.3 into the 
 following categories of changes: existing features, new features, heuristic 
 and efficiency improvements, bug fixes, changes at the system level, Emacs 
 support, and experimental versions.  Each change is described in just one 
 category, though of course many changes could be placed in more than one 
 category.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that only ACL2 system changes are listed below.  Changes to the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> can be found by browsing the <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2+Books GitHub repository<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/"></nobr></a>, in 
 particular, the raw <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master" target="_blank"><nobr>commit log<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master"></nobr></a>.  Also note 
 that with each release, some built-in functions that were formerly in 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode are now <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> 
 mode functions.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes to Existing Features</h3> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____READ-FILE-INTO-STRING.html">read-file-into-string</a></span> is now a macro, not a function. 
 It no longer takes <span class="v">state</span> as an argument (though its expansion reads the 
 state), and it has new keyword arguments that allow one to read successive 
 segments of the file.  See <a href="ACL2____READ-FILE-INTO-STRING.html">read-file-into-string</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The test has been slightly relaxed for determining whether any supporting 
 events are missing for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFABSSTOBJ.html">defabsstobj</a></span>.  Thanks to Sol Swords for sending 
 an example to illustrate the issue, together with analysis of the problem.</p> 
 
 <h3>New Features</h3> 
 
 <h3>Heuristic and Efficiency Improvements</h3> 
 
 <p>We now avoid the <a href="ACL2____INVARIANT-RISK.html">invariant-risk</a> slowdown in the case of a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode function with guard <span class="v">t</span>.  For relevant examples 
 see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAM-WRAPPER.html">program-wrapper</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A technical change in the handling of <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> computations can, in 
 rare cases, result in better built-in <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules for 
 functions.</p> 
 
 <h3>Bug Fixes</h3> 
 
 <p>Fixed a soundness bug, introduced about 10 years ago, that could occur with 
 <span class="v">:use</span> or <span class="v">:by</span> <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>s when a variable occurs free in a 
 lambda of a functional substitution.  For an explanation see a comment in 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> note-7-4 ...)</span> in community book 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>; also, a proof of <span class="v">nil</span> (in Version 
 7.3) that exploits this bug can be found in a comment in the definition of 
 function <span class="v">remove-capture-in-constraint-lst</span> in the ACL2 source code.  This 
 may be the first time that a proved ``theorem'' in the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> 
 has been discovered to be a non-theorem (<span class="v">tr-to-array-of-array-to-tr</span> in 
 <span class="v">books/projects/legacy-defrstobj/typed-records.lisp</span>).  Thanks to Sol 
 Swords for pointing out that this directory of books isn't used elsewhere; we 
 temporarily excluded it from the regression by adding a <span class="v">cert_pl_exclude</span> 
 file, until Sol Swords repaired the proof a couple of days later.  Also thanks 
 to Ruben Gamboa for fixing proofs in the <span class="v">nonstd/</span> books that failed after 
 the bug fix.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> commands <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">expand</span>, which 
 usually gave a misleading error message when attempting to expand a 
 constrained function.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed bugs in the tracking and disabling of <a href="ACL2____COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a> 
 rules.  Thanks to Dmitry Nadezhin for pointing out this bug, indeed, sending 
 an example and analyzing it to point to system function 
 <span class="v">term-and-typ-to-lookup</span>, which was indeed the one that had the bug.</p> 
 
 <p>Avoided a rare error in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-WASH.html">hons-wash</a></span> that has happened when there is a 
 second garbage collection after <span class="v">hons-wash</span> has commenced.  Thanks to 
 Keshav Kini for telling us about the problem and providing a patch, which we 
 used almost verbatim.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes at the System Level</h3> 
 
 <p>An ACL2 customization file is no longer loaded by default (when it exists) 
 when invoking `<span class="v">make</span>' from the top-level ACL2 directory.  This change is 
 not necessary for `<span class="v">make regression</span>' because the build system for the 
 books already takes care of it.  However we need this change for `<span class="v">make
 DOC</span>', at the least; thanks to Eric Smith for bringing our attention to a 
 failure of `<span class="v">make DOC</span>'.</p> 
 
 <p>(Really a books change, but affects building the manual:) By default, it is 
 now an error if when saving the ACL2+books or ACL2-only manuals (web-based or 
 text-based), a syntax error (marked by ``xdoc error'') is encountered.  See 
 <span class="tt"><a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">xdoc::save</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="XDOC____SAVE-RENDERED.html">xdoc::save-rendered</a></span>: both now have an error 
 argument with default <span class="v">nil</span> so that by default, those new errors are not 
 signaled; but in accordance with the change above, that new error argument is 
 <span class="v">t</span> for the standard ways of building the ACL2+books and ACL2-only manuals. 
 Also, two arguments have been eliminated for <span class="v">xdoc::save-rendered</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>An invocation of `<span class="v">make update</span>' to build an ACL2 executable initiates a 
 build only when necessary (that is, when at least one source file or 
 supporting file, like <span class="v">GNUmakefile</span>, has changed).  Thanks to Eric Smith 
 for the suggestion.  Removed the following `<span class="v">make</span>' targets, which were 
 suspect after this change (the first definitely no longer worked) and are 
 unnecessary: <span class="v">saved_acl2</span>, <span class="v">saved_acl2p</span>, <span class="v">saved_acl2r</span>, and 
 <span class="v">saved_acl2pr</span>.  WARNING: <span class="v">make update</span> should be used with care, since 
 it does not rebuild the desired executable when it already exists and is more 
 recent than the sources.  For example, if you change Lisp implementations 
 without changing the <span class="v">PREFIX</span> variable — perhaps even only changing 
 the version of your Lisp — then use <span class="v">make</span> or <span class="v">make large</span>, not 
 <span class="v">make update</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>New `<span class="v">make</span>' target <span class="v">clean-all</span> removes all generated files in the 
 main ACL2 directory and its <span class="v">doc/</span> subdirectory, while existing target 
 <span class="v">clean</span>, which has been renamed <span class="v">clean-lite</span>, cleans all of those except 
 files <span class="v">*saved_acl2*</span> (and <span class="v">doc.lisp.backup</span>), essentially as before. 
 Thanks to Eric Smith for suggestions leading to this change, and to Keshav 
 Kini for suggesting consideration of target <span class="v">distclean</span> as an alias for 
 <span class="v">clean-all</span>, which it now is.  The target <span class="v">clean</span> is deprecated but, 
 consistent with prior usage, acts as <span class="v">clean-lite</span> for now.</p> 
 
 <p>A successful build using `<span class="v">make</span>' shows only four lines for <span class="v">'fgrep -i
 compiler make.log</span>' instead of five.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) Installed a patch from Camm Maguire (GCL maintainer) to fix a 
 GCL compiler bug.  Also turned off SGC to avoid an ``mprotect failure'' error 
 (community book <span class="v">books/centaur/fty/tests/deftagsum-scale.lisp</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was causing an assertion failure, instead of a clean 
 error, when attempting to apply <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a></span> to undefined primitives, 
 e.g., <span class="v">:monitor cons t</span>.  Thanks to Keshav Kini for reporting this bug and 
 sending us an initial fix.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in the <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> commands <span class="v">:go!</span> and <span class="v">:go$</span>, 
 which was causing an error message to be printed.</p> 
 
 <h3>EMACS Support</h3> 
 
 <p>Made minor <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> improvements: fixed a bug in `<span class="v">u</span>' command's 
 error message when already at the top topic; fixed a bug that was displaying 
 the "Parent list:" field in reverse order; and eliminated the warning when 
 loading a large manual (combined manual is at about 70M bytes now; new 
 threshold is 80M bytes).</p> 
 
 <p>Improved <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> to work with other manuals; see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a>, 
 specifically Section ``Selecting a Manual''.  Note that the command for 
 initially bringing up the ACL2 User's Manual, instead of the ACL2+Books 
 manual, has changed from <span class="v">(defvar *acl2-doc-top-default* 'TOP)</span> to 
 <span class="v">(defvar *acl2-doc-manual-name* 'acl2-only)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added new <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> commands, `<span class="v">/</span>' and `<span class="v">W</span>', to go to an ACL2 
 definition.  By default the search is through both the ACL2 sources and books. 
 The search can be continued even outside acl2-doc by using a numeric prefix 
 argument with <span class="v">control-t /</span>, which is just the `<span class="v">/</span>' command made 
 available outside acl2-doc.  These two commands differ only in the defaults 
 presented in the minibuffer.  The default for `<span class="v">/</span>' is based on the text at 
 the cursor.  (This is much like the similar built-in Emacs command, 
 <span class="v">meta-.</span>; indeed, `<span class="v">/</span>' is next to `<span class="v">.</span>' on standard keyboards.)  For 
 `<span class="v">W</span>', the default is based on the page's topic name (as shown by the 
 `<span class="v">w</span>' command).  See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> for details.</p> 
 
 <p>Installed a patch for <span class="v">control-t control-e</span> from Keshav Kini, so that 
 when there are more than two windows and one has the ACL2 shell buffer 
 showing, then that one receives the form.  Consider for example windows A, B, 
 and C, where the cursor is showing in A and the shell buffer is showing in C. 
 Previously, the shell buffer could be placed in B to receive the form.  Now, 
 the form will go into C.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:evisc-tuple</span> keyword for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span> was being ignored when 
 <span class="v">:native t</span> was also supplied.  Since the use of <span class="v">:native t</span> sends the 
 tracing command to raw Lisp, this wasn't really a bug, since no raw Lisp we 
 know of supports the <span class="v">:evisc-tuple</span> keyword.  However, we have improved our 
 custom modifications of the native <span class="v">trace</span> for host Lisps CCL and Allegro 
 CL so that <span class="v">:evisc-tuple</span> is no longer ignored for these Lisps.</p> 
 
 <h3>Experimental Versions</h3> 
 
 <p>A new rewrite rule for ACL2(r), <span class="v">realp-implies-acl2-numberp</span>, is 
 analogous to the existing rule <span class="v">rationalp-implies-acl2-numberp</span>.  Thanks to 
 Dmitry Nadezhin for suggesting the addition of this rule, which he observed is 
 necessary for some ACL2(r) proofs.</p>
