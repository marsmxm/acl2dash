<p>Create an SVTV, storing and possibly using intermediate results from 
          the <span class="v">svtv-data</span> stobj.</p><p><span class="v">Defsvtv$</span> is a drop-in replacement for <a href="ACL2____DEFSVTV.html">defsvtv</a>, with a 
few differences.</p> 
 
<p>The implementation is different in that it operates on the <a href="SV____SVTV-DATA.html">svtv-data</a> 
stobj, storing intermediate results such as the flattening and phase 
composition in the stobj.  Subsequent invocations of <span class="v">defsvtv</span> may reuse 
these results without recomputing them if they use the same design.</p> 
 
<p>A few features are removed, namely those that overload the SVTV to represent 
a state machine rather than just a pipeline.  We removed these because the new 
preferred way to deal with FSMs is with a <span class="v">base-fsm</span> or <span class="v">svtv-fsm</span> object 
rather than an <span class="v">svtv</span> object.</p> 
 
<p>One added feature is the ability to define a clock cycle separately from the 
pipeline timing diagram.  The clock cycle is given by the <span class="v">:cycle-phases</span> 
keyword argument, which must be a list of <span class="v">svtv-cyclephase</span> objects.  A 
typical clock cycle has two phases where the clock is low in one and high in 
the other, and input signals are provided and outputs read in the clock-low 
phase:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">:cycle-phases
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="SV____MAKE-SVTV-CYCLEPHASE.html">make-svtv-cyclephase</a> :constants '(("clock" . 0))
                            :inputs-free t
                            :outputs-captured t)
      (<a href="SV____MAKE-SVTV-CYCLEPHASE.html">make-svtv-cyclephase</a> :constants '(("clock" . 1))))</pre> 
 
<p>In this case, the phases of the provided timing diagram refer to the clock 
cycles of the design rather than individual clock phases.</p> 
 
<p>The default, when the <span class="v">:cycle-phases</span> argument is not provided, is for 
all clock phases to be explicitly represented in the timing diagram; this 
corresponds to the following cycle-phases value:</p> 
<pre class="code">:cycle-phases
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="SV____MAKE-SVTV-CYCLEPHASE.html">make-svtv-cyclephase</a> :constants nil
                            :inputs-free t
                            :outputs-captured t))</pre>
