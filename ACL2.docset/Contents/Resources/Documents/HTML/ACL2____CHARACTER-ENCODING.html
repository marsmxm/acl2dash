<p>How bytes are parsed into characters</p><p>When the Common Lisp reader comes across bytes in a file or at the 
 terminal, they are parsed into characters.  The simplest case is when each 
 byte that is read is a standard character (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____STANDARD-CHAR-P.html">standard-char-p</a>).  It is 
 actually quite common that each byte that is read corresponds to a single 
 character.  The parsing of bytes into characters is based on a <i>character 
 encoding</i>, that is, a mapping that associates one or more bytes with each 
 legal character.</p> 
 
 <p>In order to help guarantee the portability of files (including <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>), ACL2 installs a common character encoding for reading files, often 
 known as ISO-8859-1 or Latin-1.  For some host Lisps this character encoding 
 is also used for reading from the terminal; but, sadly, this may not hold for 
 all host Lisps, and may not even be possible for some of them.</p> 
 
 <p>The use of the above encoding could in principle cause problems if one's 
 editor produces files using an encoding other than ISO-8859-1, at least if one 
 uses non-standard characters.  In particular, the default Emacs buffer 
 encoding may be utf-8.  If your file has non-standard characters, then in 
 Emacs you can evaluate the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(setq save-buffer-coding-system 'iso-8859-1)</pre> 
 
 <p>before saving the buffer into a file.  This will happen automatically for 
 users who load distributed file <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> into their Emacs 
 sessions.</p> 
 
 <p>For an example of character encodings in action, see the community book 
 <span class="v">books/misc/character-encoding-test.lisp</span>.</p>
