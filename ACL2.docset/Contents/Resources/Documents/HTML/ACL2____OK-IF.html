<p>Conditional exit from <span class="v">break-rewrite</span></p><pre class="code">Example Form:
:ok-if (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NULL.html">null</a> (<a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a> :wonp))

General Form:
:ok-if expr</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">expr</span> is a term involving no free variables other than <span class="v">state</span> 
 and returning one non-<span class="v">state</span> result which is treated as Boolean.  This 
 form is intended to be executed from within <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> (see <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Consider first the simple situation that the <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____OK-IF.html">ok-if</a> term)</span> is a command 
 read by <span class="v">break-rewrite</span>.  Then, if the term is non-<span class="v">nil</span>, 
 <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> exits and otherwise it does not.</p> 
 
 <p>More generally, <span class="v">ok-if</span> returns an ACL2 error triple <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val
 state)</span>.  (See <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> or see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING-WITH-STATE.html">programming-with-state</a> for more on 
 error triples.)  If any form being evaluated as a command by 
 <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> returns the triple returned by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____OK-IF.html">ok-if</a> term)</span> then the 
 effect of that form is to exit <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> if term is non-<span class="v">nil</span>. 
 Thus, one might define a function or macro that returns the value of 
 <span class="v">ok-if</span> expressions on all outputs and thus create a convenient new way to 
 exit <span class="v">break-rewrite</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The exit test, <span class="v">term</span>, generally uses <span class="v">brr@</span> to access context 
 sensitive information about the attempted rule application.  See <a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a>. 
 <span class="v">Ok-if</span> is useful inside of command sequences produced by break conditions. 
 See <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>.  <span class="v">:ok-if</span> is most useful after an <span class="v">:eval</span> command 
 has caused <span class="v">break-rewrite</span> to try to apply the rule because in the 
 resulting break environment <span class="v">expr</span> can access such things as whether the 
 rule succeeded, if so, what term it produced, and if not, why.  There is no 
 need to use <span class="v">:ok-if</span> before <span class="v">:eval</span>ing the rule since the same effects 
 could be achieved with the break condition on the rule itself.  Perhaps we 
 should replace this concept with <span class="v">:eval-and-break-if</span>?  Time will 
 tell.</p>
