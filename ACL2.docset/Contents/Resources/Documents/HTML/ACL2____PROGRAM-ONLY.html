<p>Functions that cannot be in <a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a> mode</p><p>Functions are considered to be ``program-only'' when they are in 
 <a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a> mode and they belong to the list <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>
 program-fns-with-raw-code)</span>.  For such a function, its 
 executable-counterpart (see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a>) always checks the guard.  If 
 the guard fails, then even if guard-checking is off, an error is signaled 
 because a program-only function is assumed to have an executable-counterpart 
 that should only execute the raw Lisp definition.  Moreover, an error is 
 always signaled when in <a href="ACL2____SAFE-MODE.html">safe-mode</a> (e.g., during macroexpansion), 
 because there is no guarantee that evaluation of the raw Lisp code will be 
 ``safe''.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____SAFE-MODE-CHEAT-SHEET.html">safe-mode-cheat-sheet</a> for possible workarounds.</p>
