<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=VL2014____PARSER">Click for Parser in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A parser for a subset of Verilog and SystemVerilog.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>Our parser is responsible for processing a list of <a href="VL2014____TOKENS.html">tokens</a> into our 
internal representation of Verilog <a href="VL2014____SYNTAX.html">syntax</a>.  Typically these tokens are 
produced by the <a href="VL2014____LEXER.html">lexer</a>.  Note that before parsing begins, any whitespace 
or comment tokens should be removed from the token list; see for instance <a href="VL2014____VL-KILL-WHITESPACE-AND-COMMENTS.html">vl-kill-whitespace-and-comments</a>.</p> 
 
<p>We use essentially a manual recursive-descent style parser.  Having the 
entire token stream available gives us arbitrary lookahead, and we occasionally 
make use of backtracking.</p> 
 
<h3>Scope</h3> 
 
<p>Verilog and SystemVerilog are huge languages, and we can parse only a subset 
of these languages.</p> 
 
<p>We can currently support most of the constructs in the Verilog 1364-2005 
standard.  Notably, we do not yet support user-defined primitives, generate 
statements, specify blocks, specparams, and genvars.  In some cases, the parser 
will just skip over unrecognized constructs (adding <a href="VL2014____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> when it 
does so.)  Depending on what you are doing, this behavior may be actually 
appropriate, e.g., skipping specify blocks may be okay if you aren't trying to 
deal with low-level timing issues.</p> 
 
<p>We are beginning to work toward supporting SystemVerilog based on the 
1800-2012 standard.  But this is preliminary work and you should not yet expect 
VL to correctly handle any interesting fragment of SystemVerilog.</p>
