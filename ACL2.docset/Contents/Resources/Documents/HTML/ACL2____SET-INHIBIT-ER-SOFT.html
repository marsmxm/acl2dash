 <p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> 
 but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded.  It 
 is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to the book or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form in which it occurs; 
 see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-ER-SOFT_12.html">set-inhibit-er-soft!</a> for a corresponding non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> event. 
 Indeed, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-ER-SOFT.html">set-inhibit-er-soft</a> ...)</span> is equivalent to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a>
 (<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-ER-SOFT_12.html">set-inhibit-er-soft!</a> ...))</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-ER-SOFT.html">set-inhibit-er-soft</a> string1 string2 ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>where each string is considered without regard to case.  This macro is is 
 essentially <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> inhibit-er-soft-table nil 'alist :clear))</span>, 
 where <span class="v">alist</span> pairs each supplied string with <span class="v">nil</span>: that is, <span class="v">alist</span> 
 is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PAIRLIS_42.html">pairlis$</a> lst nil)</span> where <span class="v">lst</span> is the list of strings supplied. 
 This macro is an event (see <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a>), but no output results from a 
 <span class="v">set-inhibit-er-soft</span> event.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 prints errors that are generally important to see.  This utility is 
 appropriate for situations where one prefers not to see all error messages. 
 to.  Individual ``labeled'' error output can be silenced.  Consider for 
 example</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Error [Failure] in ( DEFUN FOO ...):  See :DOC failure.</pre> 
 
 <p>Here, the label is "Failure".  The argument list for 
 <span class="v">set-inhibit-er-soft</span> is a list of such labels, each of which is a string. 
 Any error message is suppressed if its label is a member of this list, where 
 case is ignored.  Thus, for example, the error output above will be avoided 
 after a call of <span class="v">set-inhibit-er-soft</span> that contains the string, 
 <span class="v">"Failure"</span> (or any string that is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____STRING-EQUAL.html">string-equal</a></span> to 
 <span class="v">"Failure"</span>, such as <span class="v">"failure"</span> or <span class="v">"FAILURE"</span>).  In summary: 
 the effect of this event is to suppress any error output whose label is a 
 member of the given argument list, where case is ignored.</p> 
 
 <p>At this time, many error messages are printed without a label, for example 
 (as of this writing) the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x 3)


ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  Global variables, such as X, are not allowed.
See :DOC ASSIGN and :DOC @.

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>These can only be suppressed by turning off all error output; see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>.  Feel free to ask the ACL2 implementors to add 
 labels; for example, you might ask for a label in the example above (which 
 could be <span class="v">"Globals"</span> or <span class="v">"Global-variables"</span>).</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remarks</b>.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Only so-called ``soft'' errors may have labels, not ``hard'' errors.  Hard 
 errors can be identified by the use of ``<span class="v">HARD</span>'' at the start of the error 
 message, for example as follows. 
 
 <pre class="code">HARD ACL2 ERROR in SET-GAG-MODE:  Unknown set-gag-mode argument, ABC</pre>
</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">Set-inhibit-er-soft</span> has no effect on the value(s) returned by an 
 expression (excepting the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> in that it formally includes 
 output).</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The list of currently inhibited error types is the list of keys in the 
 <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> named <span class="v">inhibit-er-soft-table</span>.  (The values in the table are 
 irrelevant.)  One way to get that value is to get the result from evaluating 
 the following form: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE-ALIST.html">table-alist</a> 'inhibit-er-soft-table (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span>.  Of 
 course, if error output is inhibited overall — see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a> — then this value is entirely irrelevant.</p> 
 
 <p>See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TOGGLE-INHIBIT-ER-SOFT.html">toggle-inhibit-er-soft</a></span> for a way to add or remove a single 
 string.</p>
