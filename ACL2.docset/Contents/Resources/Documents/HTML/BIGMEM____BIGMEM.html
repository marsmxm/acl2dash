<p>A <span class="v">2^64</span>-byte memory model that is logically a record but 
  provides array-like performance during execution</p><p>The <span class="v">bigmem</span> library implements the idea in the 
   following paper using nested and abstract stobjs, which leads to a 
   simpler implementation of a large memory.</p> 
 
   <blockquote>Warren A. Hunt, Jr. and Matt Kaufmann. A Formal Model 
   of a Large Memory that Supports Efficient Execution. In Proceedings 
   of the 12th International Conference on Formal Methods in 
   Computer-Aided Design (FMCAD 2012, Cambrige, UK, October 22-25), 
   2012</blockquote> 
 
  <p>These books define an abstract stobj called <span class="v">mem</span> that exports 
  an accessor function <span class="v">read-mem</span> and an updater function 
  <span class="v">write-mem</span>. <span class="v">mem</span> is logically a typed record that models 
  <span class="v">2^64</span> bytes.  The corresponding concrete stobj for <span class="v">mem</span> is 
  <span class="v">mem$c</span>, which is a stobj containing stobjs that essentially 
  allocates chunks of bytes on demand; see <a href="BIGMEM____BIGMEM-CONCRETE-STOBJ.html">bigmem-concrete-stobj</a> for implementation details.</p> 
 
  <p>An obvious application of <span class="v">bigmem</span> is to model memory; 
  <span class="v">mem</span> can be used as a child stobj to define a field representing 
  the memory (up to <span class="v">2^64</span> bytes) in a parent stobj that models 
  some machine's state. See <span class="v">projects/x86isa/machine/state.lisp</span> 
  for one such example.</p>
