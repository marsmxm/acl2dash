<p>Hints as a Function of the Goal (not its Name)</p><p>Sometimes it is desirable to supply a hint whenever a certain term 
 arises in a conjecture.  For example, suppose we have proved</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> all-swaps-have-the-property
   (the-property (swap x))
   :rule-classes nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>and suppose that whenever <span class="v">(SWAP A)</span> occurs in a goal, we wish to add 
 the additional hypothesis that <span class="v">(THE-PROPERTY (SWAP A))</span>.  Note that this 
 is equivalent supplying the hint</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> test
    '(:use (:instance all-swaps-have-the-property (x A)))
    nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">test</span> answers the question ``does the clause contain <span class="v">(SWAP
 A)</span>?''  That question can be asked with <span class="v">(occur-lst '(SWAP A) clause)</span>. 
 Briefly, <span class="v">occur-lst</span> takes the representation of a translated term, x, and 
 a list of translated terms, y, and determines whether x occurs as a subterm of 
 any term in y.  (By ``subterm'' here we mean proper or improper, e.g., the 
 subterms of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)</span> are <span class="v">X</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>Thus, the computed hint:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (occur-lst '(swap a) clause)
    '(:use (:instance all-swaps-have-the-property (x A)))
    nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>will add the hypothesis <span class="v">(THE-PROPERTY (SWAP A))</span> to every goal 
 containing <span class="v">(SWAP A)</span> — except the children of goals to which the 
 hypothesis was added.</p> 
 
 <p><b>A COMMON MISTAKE</b> users are likely to make is to forget that they are 
 dealing with translated terms.  For example, suppose we wished to look for 
 <span class="v">(SWAP (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">LIST</a> 1 A))</span> with <span class="v">occur-lst</span>.  We would never find it with</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(occur-lst '(SWAP (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">LIST</a> 1 A)) clause)</pre> 
 
 <p>because that presentation of the term contains macros and other 
 abbreviations.  By using :trans (see <a href="ACL2____TRANS.html">trans</a>) we can obtain the 
 translation of the target term.  Then we can look for it with:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(occur-lst '(SWAP (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> '1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> A 'NIL))) clause)</pre> 
 
 <p>Note in particular that you must</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">* eliminate all macros and
* explicitly quote all constants.</pre> 
 
 <p>We recommend using <span class="v">:trans</span> to obtain the translated form of the terms 
 in which you are interested, before programming your hints.</p> 
 
 <p>An alternative is to use the expression <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PRETTYIFY-CLAUSE.html">prettyify-clause</a> clause nil
 nil)</span> in your hint to convert the current goal clause into the s-expression 
 that is actually printed.  For example, the clause</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">((<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">SYMBOLP</a> Y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> '1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)) Y))</pre> 
 
 <p>``prettyifies'' to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">SYMBOLP</a> Y)))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)) Y))</pre> 
 
 <p>which is what you would see printed by ACL2 when the goal clause is that 
 shown.</p> 
 
 <p>However, if you choose to convert your clauses to prettyified form, you 
 will have to write your own explorers (like our <span class="v">occur-lst</span>), because all 
 of the ACL2 term processing utilities work on translated and/or clausal forms. 
 This should not be taken as a terrible burden.  You will, at least, gain the 
 benefit of knowing what you are really looking for, because your explorers 
 will be looking at exactly the s-expressions you see at your terminal.  And 
 you won't have to wade through our still undocumented term/clause utilities. 
 The approach will slow things down a little, since you will be paying the 
 price of independently consing up the prettyified term.</p> 
 
 <p>We make one more note on this example.  We said above that the computed 
 hint:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (occur-lst '(swap a) clause)
    '(:use (:instance all-swaps-have-the-property (x A)))
    nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>will add the hypothesis <span class="v">(THE-PROPERTY (SWAP A))</span> to every goal 
 containing <span class="v">(SWAP A)</span> — except the children of goals to which the 
 hypothesis was added.</p> 
 
 <p>It bears noting that the subgoals produced by induction and top-level 
 forcing round goals are not children.  For example, suppose the hint above 
 fires on "Subgoal 3" and produces, say, "Subgoal 3'".  Then the hint will 
 not fire on "Subgoal 3'" even though it (still) contains <span class="v">(SWAP A)</span> 
 because "Subgoal 3'" is a child of a goal on which the hint fired.</p> 
 
 <p>But now suppose that "Subgoal 3'" is pushed for induction.  Then the 
 goals created by that induction, i.e., the base case and induction step, are 
 not considered children of "Subgoal 3'".  All of the original hints are 
 available.</p> 
 
 <p>Alternatively, suppose that "Subgoal 3' is proved but forces some other 
 subgoal, "[1]Subgoal 1" which is attacked in Forcing Round 1.  That 
 top-level forced subgoal is not a child.  All the original hints are available 
 to it.  Thus, if it contains <span class="v">(SWAP A)</span>, the hint will fire and supply the 
 hypothesis, producing "[1]Subgoal 1'".  This may be unnecessary, as the 
 hypothesis might already be present in "[1]Subgoal 1".  In this case, no 
 harm is done.  The hint won't fire on "[1]Subgoal 1'" because it is a child 
 of "[1]Subgoal 1" and the hint fired on that.</p>
