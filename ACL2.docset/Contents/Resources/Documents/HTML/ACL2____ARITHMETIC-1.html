<p>The classic <span class="v">books/arithmetic</span> library is fast and lightweight. 
It provides only modest support for reasoning about how basic operations like 
<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a>, <a href="COMMON-LISP_____F2.html">/</a>, and <a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> relate to one 
another over integers, rationals, and (for ACL2(r) users) the <a href="COMMON-LISP____REAL.html">real</a>s.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>The original <span class="v">arithmetic</span> library dates back to the early days of ACL2. 
Many people contributed to its development, especially Bishop Brock, John 
Cowles, Matt Kaufmann, Art Flatau, and Ruben Gamboa.  The <span class="v">natp-posp</span> book 
was contributed more recently by Panagiotis Manolios and Daron Vroon.  The 
documentation was added by Jared Davis.</p> 
 
<p>When should you use <span class="v">arithmetic</span>?  Later arithmetic libraries like 
<span class="v">arithmetic-3</span> and <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span> are more comprehensive.  They support 
reasoning about many operations that <span class="v">arithmetic</span> does not, e.g., <a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Later libraries typically also feature more sophisticated rules that can 
automatically solve much harder goals that involve only the basic operators. 
So, if you are facing hard arithmetic problems, or if your problems involve 
operators that <span class="v">arithmetic</span> does not support, you should definitely consider 
using other libraries.</p> 
 
<p>On the other hand, if you have simpler arithmetic needs, the ordinary 
<span class="v">arithmetic</span> library may be a fine choice.  It is lightweight and fast, and 
typically does not cause rewriting loops.  It can also sometimes be easier to 
understand what <span class="v">arithmetic</span> is doing than other libraries, i.e., it is less 
likely to lead you to strange subgoals that you don't understand.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Loading the Library</h3> 
 
<p>To avoid getting locked into any particular arithmetic library, good 
practice is to always only <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a>ly include arithmetic books.  So, to 
load the most complete version of the <span class="v">arithmetic</span> library, you should 
typically use:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "arithmetic/top-with-meta" :dir :system))</pre> 
 
<p>In certain cases, more sophisticated users may wish to load only some 
portion of the library.  A reasonable, slightly lighter-weight alternative 
is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "arithmetic/top" :dir :system))</pre>
