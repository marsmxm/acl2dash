<p>Support for Verilog comments.</p><p>Both Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012 support two forms of 
comments.  Single-line comments that start with <span class="v">//</span> and end with a newline. 
Multi-line comments start with <span class="v">/*</span> and end with <span class="v">*/</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Many lexers would skip past comments (and whitespace).  We instead create 
<span class="v">:vl-comment</span> tokens.  This is generally meant to allow us to preserve 
comments as we process and pretty-print the source code.</p> 
 
<p>See also the comments in <a href="VL____PREPROCESSOR-IFDEF-MINUTIA.html">preprocessor-ifdef-minutia</a> regarding line 
continuations and comments in macro text.</p>
