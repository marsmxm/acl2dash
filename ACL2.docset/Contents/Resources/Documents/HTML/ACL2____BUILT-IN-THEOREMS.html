<p>Built-in theorems.</p><p>The ACL2 source file <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span> provides a number of theorems. 
     Here we mean `theorem' in the logical sense, 
     introduced not only via <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> but also via <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> 
     (logically, axioms are easy-to-prove theorems).</p><p>This documentation topic (and subtopics) 
     collects and display these theorems, 
     organized according to the built-in functions and values that they involve. 
     These theorems may be easier to read and analyze here 
     than in the ACL2 source files, which contain additional code.</p><p>The current organization of these theorems in subtopics 
     may be improved in the future. 
     It may even make sense to repeat certain theorems under certin subtopics, 
     when they are relevant to multiple subtopics.</p><p>We use the XDOC preprocessor directive <span class="v">@(def ...)</span> 
     to list the theorems automatically, 
     without copying the forms (just the names). 
     Thus, the only way in which this documentation topic may get out of sync 
     is when some built-in theorem is added or removed, 
     which may be a rare occurrence.</p><p>For now we only include the theorems of ``plain'' ACL2, not ACL2(r).</p><p>We omit theorems about ``internal'' functions, 
     i.e. functions not documented in the manual. 
     An example is 
     the theorem that rewrites <span class="v">member-eq-exec</span> to <span class="v">member-equal</span>: 
     <span class="v">member-eq-exec</span> is internal, and in fact 
     the purpose of the aforementioned rewrite rule is to rewrite it away.</p>
