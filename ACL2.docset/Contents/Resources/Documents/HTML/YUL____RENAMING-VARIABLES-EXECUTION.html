<p>Proof that variable renaming preserves the execution behavior.</p><p>We start by extending the variable renaming relation 
     from the abstract syntax to the dynamic semantic entities, 
     namely function environments and computation states 
     (and their constituents). 
     For these, we define the relation as a predicate, 
     instead of a function that may return errors, 
     as we never need to return anything if the relation holds 
     (while, for certain abstract syntax entities, 
     we need to return additional information, e.g. the extended renaming.</p><p>Then we prove theorems relating variable renamings 
     to the various dynamic semantic operations. 
     Examples of these operations are writing variables, 
     finding functions in environments, and so on.</p><p>Next, we show some properties of computation states and variable renamings, 
     which do not involve dynamic semantic operations.</p><p>Then we prove theorems saying 
     that executing a list of statements yields a computation state 
     with a superset of the starting variables, 
     and that executing loop iterations yields a computation state 
     with the same variables as the starting state. 
     These theorems are independent from variable renaming, 
     and could be moved to a more central place, 
     possibly complemented by similar properties 
     for executing other kinds of abstract syntax entities.</p><p>Then we prove some theorems about limit errors. 
     In particular, we prove that 
     several dynamic semantic operations never return limit errors. 
     These theorems are actually independent from variable renaming, 
     and could be moved to a more central place.</p><p>Before proving the main theorems, 
     we prove two preliminary ones having to do with 
     the use of <span class="tt"><a href="YUL____RESTRICT-VARS.html">restrict-vars</a></span> in execution, 
     when dealing with parallel executions related by variable renaming.</p><p>Finally we prove theorems 
     about the execution functions and variable renaming. 
     We do that by induction, using a custom induction schema.</p>
