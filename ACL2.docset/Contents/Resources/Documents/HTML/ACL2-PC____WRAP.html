<p>(atomic macro) 
execute the indicated instructions and combine all the new goals</p><pre class="code">Example:
(wrap induct) ; induct, then replace first new goal by the conjunction of all
              ; the new goals, and drop all new goals after the first

General Form:
(wrap &amp;rest instrs)</pre> 
 
 <p>First the instructions in <span class="v">instrs</span> are executed, as in <span class="v">do-all</span>.  If 
 this ``fails'' then no additional action is taken.  Otherwise, the current 
 goal after execution of <span class="v">instrs</span> is conjoined with all ``new'' goals, in 
 the sense that their names are not among the names of goals at the time 
 <span class="v">instrs</span> was begun.  This conjunction becomes the new current goal and 
 those ``new'' goals are dropped.</p> 
 
 <p>See the code for the interactive <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command, 
 <span class="v">wrap-induct</span>, for an example of the use of <span class="v">wrap</span>.</p>
