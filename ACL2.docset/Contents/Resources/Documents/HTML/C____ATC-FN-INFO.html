</dl><p>This consists of: 
     an optional C type that is present, 
     and represents the function's output type, 
     when the function is not recursive; 
     a list of C types representing the function's input types; 
     an optional (loop) statement that is present, 
     and is represented by the function, 
     when the function is recursive; 
     a list of variables affected by the function; 
     the name of the locally generated theorem about the function result(s); 
     the name of the locally generated theorem that asserts 
     that the execution of the function is functionally correct; 
     the name of the locally generated theorem that asserts 
     that the measure of the function (when recursive) yields a natural number 
     (<span class="v">nil</span> if the function is not recursive); 
     the name of the locally generated theorem that asserts 
     that looking up the function in the function environment 
     yields the information for the function 
     (<span class="v">nil</span> if the function is recursive); 
     and a limit that suffices to execute the code generated from the function, 
     as explained below. 
     The limit is a term that may depend on the function's parameters. 
     For a non-recursive function, 
     the term expresses a limit that suffices to execute <span class="tt"><a href="C____EXEC-FUN.html">exec-fun</a></span> 
     on the C function generated from the ACL2 function 
     when the arguments of the C functions have values 
     symbolically expressed by the ACL2 function's formal parameters. 
     For a recursive function, 
     the term expressed a limit that suffices to execute <span class="tt"><a href="C____EXEC-STMT-WHILE.html">exec-stmt-while</a></span> 
     on the C loop generated from the ACL2 function 
     when the variables read by the C loop have values 
     symbolically expressed by the ACL2 function's formal parameters. 
     If none of the target ACL2 functions are recursive, 
     all the limit terms are quoted constants; 
     if there are recursive functions, 
     then those, and all their direct and indirect callers, 
     have limit terms that in general depend on each function's parameters. 
     All these limit terms are calculated 
     when the C code is generated from the ACL2 functions.</p><p>Note that exactly one of the first two fields is <span class="v">nil</span>. 
     This is an invariant.</p>
