<p>Ordinals in ACL2</p><p>Ordinals are used in ACL2 for proving termination in the admission 
 of recursive function definitions.  For a proof that the ACL2 ordinals are 
 well-founded, see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-OF-WELL-FOUNDEDNESS.html">proof-of-well-foundedness</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The representation of ordinals changed in ACL2 Version_2.8, and is due to 
 Pete Manolios and Daron Vroon.  They have also defined algorithms for ordinal 
 arithmetic, created a library of theorems to reason about ordinal arithmetic, 
 and written the rest of this documentation in order to explain this change. 
 We thank them for their efforts.  Although they have provided the 
 implementation and even modified the community books as needed, we have looked 
 over their work and are maintaining it (and this documentation); if there are 
 any bugs, they should be considered ours (Matt Kaufmann and J Moore).</p> 
 
 <p>A book is included for compatibility with the representation before 
 Version_2.8.  For books that contain events relying on the previous ordinal 
 implementation, insert the following lines before the first such event:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "ordinals/e0-ordinal" :dir :system)
(<a href="ACL2____SET-WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION.html">set-well-founded-relation</a> e0-ord-&lt;)</pre> 
 
 <p>The new ordinal representation is based on a slightly different version of 
 Cantor Normal Form than that used by the old ordinals.  An advantage of the 
 new representation is that it is exponentially more succinct than the old 
 representation.</p> 
 
 <p>While pre-Version_2.8 ACL2 versions provided built-in functions for 
 checking if an object is an ordinal and for comparing two ordinals, they did 
 not provide support for reasoning about and constructing ordinals.  The 
 community books directory <span class="v">books/ordinals</span> provides such support.  First, 
 it provides efficient algorithms for ordinal arithmetic (including addition, 
 subtraction, multiplication, and exponentiation).  The algorithms and their 
 complexity are described in the following paper.</p>

 <p>Second, the algorithms are mechanically verified and libraries of theorems 
 which can be used to automate reasoning involving the ordinals are provided.

 <p>We now describe aspects of the above mentioned books in more detail.</p> 
 
 <p>The new ordering function is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O_C3.html">o&lt;</a></span> and the new ordinal recognizer is 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O-P.html">o-p</a></span>.  See also <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POSP.html">posp</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O_C3_D3.html">o&lt;=</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O_E3.html">o&gt;</a></span>, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O_E3_D3.html">o&gt;=</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O-FIRST-EXPT.html">o-first-expt</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O-FIRST-COEFF.html">o-first-coeff</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O-RST.html">o-rst</a></span>, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-ORD.html">make-ord</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O-FINP.html">o-finp</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O-INFP.html">o-infp</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The old ordinals were based on the following formulation of Cantor Normal 
 Form:</p> 
 
 <p>For any ordinal, <span class="v">a &lt; epsilon-0</span>, there exist natural numbers <span class="v">p</span> and 
 <span class="v">n</span>, and ordinals <span class="v">a1 &gt;= a2 &gt;= ... &gt;= an &gt; 0</span> such that <span class="v">a &gt; a1</span> and 
 <span class="v">a = w^(a1) + w^(a2) + ... + w^(an) + p</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Thus, a predicate recognizing ACL2's old ordinals is given by the following 
 definition.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> e0-ordinalp (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____E0-ORDINALP.html">e0-ordinalp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) 0))
           (<a href="ACL2____E0-ORDINALP.html">e0-ordinalp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))
               (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____E0-ORD-_C3.html">e0-ord-&lt;</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADR.html">cadr</a> x)))))
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> x)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____E3_D3.html">&gt;=</a> x 0))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The new representation is based on a corollary to the above theorem, which 
 we get by the left distributive property of ordinal multiplication over 
 ordinal addition. Thus, <span class="v">w^a + w^a = (w^a)2</span>, <span class="v">w^a + w^a + w^a = (w^a)3</span> 
 and so forth. The corollary is as follows:</p> 
 
 <p>For any ordinal, <span class="v">a &lt; epsilon-0</span>, there exist natural numbers <span class="v">p</span> and 
 <span class="v">n</span>, positive integers <span class="v">x1, x2, ..., xn</span> and ordinals <span class="v">a1 &gt; a2 &gt; ... &gt;
 an &gt; 0</span> such that <span class="v">a &gt; a1</span> and <span class="v">a = w^(a1)x1 + w^(a2)x2 + ... + w^(an)xn
 + p</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Instead of representing an ordinal as a list of non-increasing ordinals, we 
 represent it as a list of exponent-coefficient pairs, such that the exponents 
 are strictly decreasing (see <a href="ACL2____O-P.html">o-p</a>).  Note that this representation is 
 exponentially more efficient than the old representation.</p> 
 
 <p>The ordinal arithmetic functions: <span class="v">o+</span>, <span class="v">o-</span>, <span class="v">o*</span>, and <span class="v">o^</span> 
 are defined in the ordinals library (in the community books directory 
 <span class="v">books/ordinals</span>). To use them, include the book 
 <span class="v">ordinals-without-arithmetic</span> or <span class="v">ordinals</span>, depending on whether you 
 want the arithmetic books included or not (<span class="v">ordinals</span> includes community 
 book <span class="v">books/arithmetic/top-with-meta</span>). To use the old ordinals, include 
 the book <span class="v">e0-ordinal</span> and run the command <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION.html">set-well-founded-relation</a>
 e0-ord-&lt;)</span></p> 
 
 <p>The community book <a href="ACL2____ARITHMETIC_F2NATP-POSP.html">arithmetic/natp-posp</a> is a book for reasoning 
 about <span class="v">posp</span> and <span class="v">natp</span>.  We recommend using this book if you have to 
 reason about <span class="v">posp</span> and <span class="v">natp</span>.  It is included in community book 
 <span class="v">books/arithmetic/top</span>, which is included in community book 
 <span class="v">books/arithmetic/top-with-meta</span>, which is included in community book 
 <span class="v">books/ordinals/ordinals</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If you have a good reason to use the old definitions of the ordinals (e.g., 
 because of legacy code and theorems), then we provide a convenient way to do 
 this.  The book <span class="v">ordinal-isomorphism</span> proves that the new ordinals are 
 order-isomorphic to the old ordinals and thus theorems proved in one context 
 can be directly transferred to the other.  For an example of how to do this, 
 look at the book <span class="v">defmul</span> in the community books directory 
 <span class="v">books/workshops/2000/ruiz/multiset</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The ordinals books have been used to prove non-trivial theorems.  For a 
 good example, see the books in the community books directory 
 <span class="v">books/workshops/2003/sustik/support</span>, where Matyas Sustik proves Dickson's 
 lemma.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, many termination proofs can be carried out with weaker orderings 
 than the ordinals up to <span class="v">epsilon-0</span>.  For example, many inductive theorem 
 provers only know that the lexicographic ordering on natural numbers is 
 well-founded.  The book <span class="v">lexicographic-ordering</span> contains a definition of 
 such an ordering <span class="v">l&lt;</span> whose arguments are either a list of natural numbers, 
 or a natural number.  In the book we prove that <span class="v">l&lt;</span> is well-founded (that 
 is, we prove a <span class="v">:well-founded-relation</span> <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> and provide a macro 
 <span class="v">llist</span> to simplify the generation of measure functions.  We also show how 
 to use <span class="v">l&lt;</span> to prove that the famous Ackermann function terminates. 
 Finally, since <span class="v">l&lt;</span> does something reasonable with natural numbers, it gets 
 along with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a></span>, the default measure chosen by ACL2.</p>
