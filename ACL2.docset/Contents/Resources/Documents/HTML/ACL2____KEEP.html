<p>How we know if <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> read the correct files</p><p>The certificate (see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for general information) of 
 a certified file contains a <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> and a keep.  These names come 
 from castle lore.  The keep is the strongest and usually tallest tower of a 
 castle from which the entire courtyard can be surveyed by the defenders.  The 
 keep of a book is a list of file names and <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> values used after 
 the book has been included, to determine if the files read were (up to 
 book-hash) those certified.</p> 
 
 <p>Once the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> is open, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> can enter the book 
 and read the event forms therein.  The non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> event forms are in 
 fact executed, extending the host theory.  That may read in other <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  When that has been finished, the keep of the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> is 
 inspected.  The keep is a list of the book names which are included 
 (hereditarily through all sub-books) in the certified book (including the 
 certified book itself) together with the <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> values for those 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> at the time of certification.  We compare the book-hash values of 
 the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> just included to those of the <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> stored in the 
 keep.  If differences are found then we know that the book or one of its 
 sub-books has been changed since certification.</p>
