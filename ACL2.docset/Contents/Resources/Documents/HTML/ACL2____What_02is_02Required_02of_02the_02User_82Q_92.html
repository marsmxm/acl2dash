<p>What is Required of the User?</p><p><a href="ACL2____How_02Long_02Does_02It_02Take_02to_02Become_02an_02Effective_02User_82Q_92.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/flying.gif"></div></a></p> 
 
 <p>It is not easy to build ACL2 models of complex systems.  To do so, the user 
 must <b>understand</b></p> 
 
 <pre class="code">* the system being modeled, and

* ACL2, at least as a programming language.</pre> 
 
 <p>It is not easy to get ACL2 to prove hard theorems.  To do so, the user must 
 <b>understand</b></p> 
 
 <pre class="code">* the model,

* ACL2 as a mathematical logic, and

* be able to construct a proof (in interaction with ACL2).</pre> 
 
 <p>ACL2 will help construct the proof but its primary role is to prevent 
 logical mistakes.  The creative burden — the mathematical insight into 
 <b>why the model has the desired property</b> — is the user's 
 responsibility.</p>
