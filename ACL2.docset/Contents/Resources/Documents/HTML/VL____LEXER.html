<p>A lexer for Verilog and SystemVerilog.</p><p>Our lexer is intended to correctly support the full syntax for 
Verilog-2005 and SystemVerilog-2012.  There are some significant differences 
between these languages, e.g., Verilog has only a subset of SystemVerilog's 
keywords and operators.  You can configure which edition of the standard is 
being used; see <a href="VL____VL-LOADCONFIG-P.html">vl-loadconfig-p</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Note: our support for SystemVerilog is preliminary and may be buggy.  Our 
parser does not yet support much of SystemVerilog, and some lexer details may 
change as we work to extend the parser.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Interface</h3> 
 
<p>This lexer is a small part of VL's <a href="VL____LOADER.html">loader</a>.  The input to the lexer 
should already be <a href="VL____PREPROCESSOR.html">preprocessed</a>, i.e., 
there should not be any grave characters (<span class="v">`</span>) in the input.</p> 
 
<p>Conventional lexers are often implemented as a <span class="v">get-token</span> routine, the 
idea being that, at the parser's request, the lexer should read just enough 
from the input stream to provide the next token.</p> 
 
<p>In contrast, our top-level lexer function, <a href="VL____VL-LEX.html">vl-lex</a>, processes the 
whole list of input characters that are produced by the <a href="VL____PREPROCESSOR.html">preprocessor</a>, 
and generates a whole list of <a href="VL____TOKENS.html">tokens</a> as output.  (It also generates a 
list of <a href="VL____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a>, e.g., when integer constants are truncated.)</p> 
 
<p>This is obviously inefficient.  On the other hand, memory is abundant and 
lexing is almost intrinsically <span class="v">O(n)</span>.  Meanwhile, our approach allows our 
parser to be state-free, with arbitrary lookahead, and also gives us the 
convenience of list-based (rather than file-based) debugging and unit testing 
throughout the whole process; see for instance <a href="VL____MAKE-TEST-TOKENS.html">make-test-tokens</a>.</p> 
 
<p>A basic correctness result for our lexer is:</p> 
 
<p><b>Theorem: </b>vl-tokenlist-&gt;etext-of-vl-lex</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> vl-tokenlist-&gt;etext-of-vl-lex
        (<a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> (((<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> okp tokens ?warnings)
              (<a href="VL____VL-LEX.html">vl-lex</a> echars
                      :warnings warnings
                      :config config)))
            (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> okp (<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> (<a href="VL____VL-ECHARLIST-P.html">vl-echarlist-p</a> echars))
                          (<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> echars)))
                     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="VL____VL-TOKENLIST-_E3ETEXT.html">vl-tokenlist-&gt;etext</a> tokens)
                            echars))))</pre> 
 
<p>That is, whenever the lexer successfully tokenizes its input <span class="v">echars</span>, 
you could flatten the resulting tokens to recover exactly the input text.</p> 
 
<p>This theorem is not entirely satisfying.  It doesn't say anything about 
whether we've tokenized the input correctly, i.e., in the sense of the Verilog 
standard.  We can't really think of a reasonable way to formalize that.  But it 
does mean that we at least accounted for every character of input, and that's 
probably worth something.</p> 
 
<p>To make this theorem possible, our lexer produces tokens even for whitespace 
and comments.  These tokens are not suitable as input for the <a href="VL____PARSER.html">parser</a>, 
and should be removed using <a href="VL____VL-KILL-WHITESPACE-AND-COMMENTS.html">vl-kill-whitespace-and-comments</a> before 
parsing begins.</p> 
 
<p>Since we often want to use VL to transform or simplify Verilog source code, 
we don't throw away commentsâ€”instead, we collect them up into a <a href="VL____VL-COMMENTMAP-P.html">vl-commentmap-p</a>.  We that later use comment maps to re-attach the comments to 
the right parts of the tree; see for instance <a href="VL____VL-PPC-MODULE.html">vl-ppc-module</a>.</p>
