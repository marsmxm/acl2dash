<p>Java expressions [JLS:15].</p><p>We do not capture 
     lambda expressions, 
     class literals, and 
     method references.</p><p>For expression names [JLS:6.5], we use ACL2 strings, 
     which allow dot-separated identifiers, 
     as well as <span class="v">this</span> and <span class="v">super</span>.</p><p>We only capture monodimensional array creation expressions 
     with either an explicit size that is an expression 
     or an array initializer that is a sequence of expressions. 
     The type field is the primitive or class/interface element type, 
     not the array type, which is implicitly the one 
     whose element type if the one in the type field.</p><p>In an array access expression, 
     we allow any expression as the first one.</p><p>We only capture class instance creation expressions 
     that consist of <span class="v">new</span>, a class name, and contructor arguments.</p><p>In a field access expression, 
     we allow any expression as the first one.</p><p>We capture method invocations of three kinds: 
     static (which start with a type), 
     instance (which start with an expression), 
     and generic (which start with the method name). 
     The generic ones may be static or instance, 
     depending on how the Java compiler resolves them. 
     This is a rough model of Java method invocation expressions, 
     but it suffices for ATJ's purposes.</p><p>We also include parenthesized expressions, 
     which normally do not belong to an abstract syntax 
     because the tree structure of the abstract syntax 
     provides the intended grouping of the nested expressions. 
     However, having explicit parenthesized expressions in the abstract syntax 
     provides more flexibility, 
     e.g. to capture parentheses that would not be needed for corectness 
     but could perhaps improve clarity and readability.</p><p>The abstract syntax allows any type, not just reference types, 
     as the right-hand side of <span class="v">instanceof</span>. 
     This may be improved in the future.</p>
