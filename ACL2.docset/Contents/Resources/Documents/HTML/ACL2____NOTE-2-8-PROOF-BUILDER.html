<p>ACL2 Version  2.8 Notes on proof-builder Changes</p><p>Added new <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> commands <span class="v">wrap1</span>, <span class="v">wrap</span>, and 
 <span class="v">wrap-induct</span>.  <span class="v">Wrap</span> replaces multiple goals by their conjunction: 
 <span class="v">(wrap instr1 instr2 ...)</span> employs <span class="v">wrap1</span> so that the indicated 
 instructions create only at most one new goal.  <span class="v">Wrap-induct</span> is a simple 
 example of the use of <span class="v">wrap</span>, so that induction creates only one goal (the 
 conjunction of the base and induction steps).  <span class="v">Wrap1</span> can be used 
 immediately after a prover call (<span class="v">bash</span>, <span class="v">prove</span>, <span class="v">reduce</span>, <span class="v">bdd</span>, 
 or <span class="v">induct</span>) to collapse the new goals into one.  See <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER-COMMANDS.html">proof-builder-commands</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command <span class="v">=</span> failed to work as expected when a 
 governing <span class="v">IF</span>-test of the current term is T.  This has been fixed (by 
 fixing source function <span class="v">conjuncts-of</span>).  Thanks to Yoann Padioleau for 
 bringing this problem to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">type-alist</span> command now takes optional arguments that control 
 whether or not the governors and/or conclusion are used in computing the 
 context that is printed (see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER-COMMANDS.html">proof-builder-commands</a>, specifically 
 subtopic <span class="v">type-alist</span>).  Thanks to Rob Sumners for suggesting this 
 improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TOGGLE-PC-MACRO.html">toggle-pc-macro</a></span> has always taken an optional second 
 argument of <span class="v">atomic-macro</span> or <span class="v">macro</span>.  However, this was not clearly 
 documented, and those two symbols had to be in the <span class="v">ACL2</span> package.  Both of 
 these problems have been remedied.  Thanks to John Erickson for bringing the 
 lack of documentation of the second argument to our attention.</p>
