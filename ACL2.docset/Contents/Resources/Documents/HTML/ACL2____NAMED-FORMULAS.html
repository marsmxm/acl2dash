<p>Utilities for named formulas.</p><p> 
   A <i>named formula</i> is a formula with a name (a symbol). 
   </p> 
   <p> 
   There are utilities to (attempt to) programmatically prove named formulas, 
   optionally printing progress messages. 
   There are also utilities to turn named formulas into theorem event forms, 
   ensuring the freshness and uniqueness of the theorem names.
