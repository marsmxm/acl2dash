<p>Error values used in the formalization of C for ATC.</p><p>When we formalize static and dynamic semantics of C, 
     our ACL2 functions return error values in certain circumstances. 
     An example is when a run-time in our defensive dynamic semantics fails, 
     e.g. due to a value having the wrong type for an operator. 
     Another example is when some static constraints fail, 
     e.g. a variable is referenced in some code without being in scope.</p><p>These ACL2 functions return different kinds of values 
     when they do not fail. 
     Thus, the return types of these functions include 
     both those values and error values.</p><p>We introduce a fixtype for error values, 
     which will be used in all those ACL2 functions.</p><p>We also introduce a macro to generate a fixtype that consists of 
     a specified fixtype for the non-error values 
     and the error fixtype. 
     This is somewhat analogous to Rust's <span class="v">Result</span> type, 
     but with a fixed type for the error type parameter.</p>
