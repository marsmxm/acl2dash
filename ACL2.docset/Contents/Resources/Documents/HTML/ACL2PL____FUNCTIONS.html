<p>A formalization of ACL2 defined functions.</p><p>Functions are defined via <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> in ACL2. 
     Its arguments include a list of formal parameters and a body, 
     among others.</p><p>In our formalization, for now we only consider a function's 
     name, parameters, and body. 
     Thus, we introduce a notion of function as consisting of 
     a name (a symbol), 
     a list of parameters (symbols), 
     and a body (a translated term); 
     here we capture the unnormalized body of the function. 
     This notion may be extended in the future as needed, 
     e.g. to include a function's guard.</p><p>This is distinct from the notion of translated functions 
     introduced as part of translated terms. 
     Those (see the fixtype <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2PL____TFUNCTION.html">tfunction</a></span>) 
     consist of symbols (i.e. just function names) 
     and lambda expressions (i.e. unnamed functions).</p>
