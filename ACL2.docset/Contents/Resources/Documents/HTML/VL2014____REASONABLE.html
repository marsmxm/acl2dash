<p>Identify modules in our supported subset of Verilog.</p><p>We say a module is <i>reasonable</i> if it</p> 
 
<ol> 
  <li>is semantically well-formed, and</li> 
  <li>does not contain unsupported constructs.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p>Even though our parser essentially establishes that the files we have just 
read are syntactically well-formed, this does not necessarily mean the files 
are semantically well-formed.  For instance, a module might illegally declare 
the same wire twice, or perhaps we have tried to declare two modules with the 
same name.  So, our reasonableness check is important for ensuring the basic 
semantic correctness of the modules we are examining.</p> 
 
<p>We also regard many perfectly valid Verilog constructs as unreasonable, for 
the simple pragmatic reason that we are only really interested in dealing with 
the small subset of Verilog that we actually encounter at Centaur.  There is 
little motivation for us to support things like complicated port lists merely 
because they are in the Verilog-2005 standard.</p>
