 <p>But ACL2 is a <b>logic</b>.  We can <b>prove theorems about the 
 model</b>.</p> 
 
 <p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/computing-machine-xxy.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><b>Theorem.  MC 'mult is a multiplier</b> 
(implies (and (natp x) 
              (natp y)) 
         (equal (lookup 'z (mc (s 'mult x y) (mclk x))) 
                (* x y))). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>This theorem says that a certain program running on the <b>mc</b> machine 
 will correctly multiply <b>any two natural numbers</b>.</p> 
 
 <p>It is a statement about an <b>infinite</b> number of test cases!</p> 
 
 <p>We know it is true about the model because we <b>proved</b> it.</p> 
 
 <p>Of course, models of actual machines usually only accept a finite number of 
 different inputs.  For example, engineers at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), 
 Centaur, and IBM have ACL2 models of floating point units that operate on 
 double precision IEEE floating point numbers.  These are finite models.  But 
 the size of their inputs is sufficiently large that they are verified by the 
 same mathematical methods used to prove theorems about infinite state systems 
 like our little <span class="v">mc</span>.</p>
