<p>System-level algorithms that users can modify with attachments</p><p>For background on attachments, see <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>If you evaluate the form <span class="v">(global-val 'attachments-at-ground-zero (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a>
 state))</span>, you will see a list of pairs of the form <span class="v">(f . g)</span>, where <span class="v">f</span> 
 is a built-in constrained utility and <span class="v">g</span> is its attachment.  Here is one 
 such pair.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(ASSUME-TRUE-FALSE-AGGRESSIVE-P . CONSTANT-NIL-FUNCTION-ARITY-0)</pre> 
 
 <p>Users are permitted to modify these attachments, even without a trust tag 
 (see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>), because they do not affect soundness.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH-SYSTEM.html">defattach-system</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We do not attempt to explain how to define functions to attach to system 
 functions.  We do however point out these two useful functions, for attaching 
 to some constant functions (functions with arity 0).</p> 
 
 <p><b>Function: </b>constant-t-function-arity-0</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> constant-t-function-arity-0
       nil (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))
       t)</pre> 
 
 <p><b>Function: </b>constant-nil-function-arity-0</p><pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> constant-nil-function-arity-0
       nil (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))
       nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>To see how to use one of these functions, consider again the example above, 
 where constrained system function <span class="v">assume-true-false-aggressive-p</span> has the 
 attachment, <span class="v">constant-nil-function-arity-0</span>.  Here we make the so-called 
 ``assume-true-false'' algorithm more aggressive.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH-SYSTEM.html">defattach-system</a> assume-true-false-aggressive-p constant-t-function-arity-0)</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that we are not explaining here what it means to make that algorithm 
 more aggressive!  We expect those who want to use these attachments to be 
 comfortable as ``system programmers'', as they peruse the ACL2 source code and 
 its comments in order to see how to modify system behavior with attachments. 
 Perhaps more user-level documentation will be written to help with that 
 process.</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____EFFICIENCY.html">efficiency</a> for more about using attachments to modify the 
 prover's behavior.</p>
