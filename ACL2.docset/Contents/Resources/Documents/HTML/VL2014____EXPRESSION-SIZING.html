<p>Calculate the widths and types of expressions.</p><p>Expression sizing and typing is <b>possibly the most complex, 
error-prone, and subtle aspect</b> of processing Verilog expressions.  One 
reason for this is that the size and signedness of subexpressions depends upon 
the other terms in the expressions that contain them.  For instance, the result 
of <span class="v">((4'd14 + 4'd3) &gt;&gt; 4'd1)</span> might be either 8 or 0, depending on where it 
is being used.  Another reason is just how elaborate the rules for sizing are, 
and how many corner cases there are.</p> 
 
<p>These issues mean that great care must be taken even when writing 
simple-looking reductions like constant folding.  Moreover, you really need to 
understand how sizing works if you are going to safely write any code that 
generates Verilog expressions.</p> 
 
<p>I have put together a gentle <a href="VL2014____EXPRESSION-SIZING-INTRO.html">expression-sizing-intro</a> which describes 
Verilog's basic algorithm for how sizes and types are determined.  You may also 
wish to familiarize yourself with the VL notion of <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-WELLTYPED-P.html">well-typed</a> expressions.</p> 
 
<p>The expression-sizing transformation attempts to determine expression sizes 
and types throughout a module.  Prerequisite transformations:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>
<a href="VL2014____PORTDECL-SIGN.html">portdecl-sign</a>, so we get can signedness right,</li> 
 <li>
<a href="VL2014____UNPARAMETERIZATION.html">unparameterization</a>, so there are no paramterized widths, and</li> 
 <li>
<a href="VL2014____RANGERESOLVE.html">rangeresolve</a>, so the ranges of wires and selects have been 
     determined.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>BOZO follow-hids might also be a prerequisite when we add support for 
HIDs.</p> 
 
<p>It is valid to run this transformation any time after the above transforms 
have been run.  It is also "idempotent," so it is perfectly valid to run the 
transform more than once on the same module (e.g., perhaps your subsequent 
transformation wishes to add some assignment statements, and subsequently wants 
to determine their sizes.</p>
