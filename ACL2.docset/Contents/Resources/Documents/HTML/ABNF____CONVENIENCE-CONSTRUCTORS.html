<p>Utilities to conveniently construct abstract syntactic entities.</p><p>These functions and macros have short and evocative names, 
     to support the concise and readable construction of (constituents of) rules 
     in the abstract syntax.</p><p>These functions and macros are used only to define 
     the core rules [RFC:B] and the concrete syntax rules [RFC:4]. 
     Thus, these function and macros only need to handle 
     the constructs used in those rules, not all possible constructs.</p>
