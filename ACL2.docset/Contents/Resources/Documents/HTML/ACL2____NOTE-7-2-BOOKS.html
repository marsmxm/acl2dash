 <h3>New Libraries</h3> 
 
<h4><a href="ACL2____KESTREL-BOOKS.html">kestrel-books</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Kestrel Institute's contributions are now available under 
 <span class="v">kestrel/</span> directory. This directory contains some system 
 utilities to complement the built-in <a href="ACL2____SYSTEM-UTILITIES.html">system-utilities</a>. It also 
 includes some general utilities to build and execute tests, retrieve 
 constituents of ACL2 events like <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a>, etc.</p> 
 
 <h4>Modeling Algorithms in SystemC and ACL2</h4> 
 
 <p>David Russinoff has contributed a library, <span class="v">projects/masc/</span>, 
 for modeling algorithms in SystemC and ACL2.</p> 
 
 <h4>SOFT</h4> 
 
 <p>Alessandro Coglio has contributed a tool called SOFT (Second-Order 
 Functions and Theorems) that mimics second-order behavior. See 
 <span class="v">tools/soft.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4>stateman</h4> 
 
 <p>J Strother Moore's <span class="v">stateman</span> books are located in 
 <span class="v">projects/stateman/</span>. <span class="v">Stateman</span> is a utility that uses 
 metafunctions to manage large terms tepresenting machine states.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____SV.html">sv</a></h4> 
 
 <p>SV is a new hardware verification library from Centaur Technology 
that includes a vector-based expression representation, efficient 
symbolic simulation integrated with <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a>, and support for many 
SystemVerilog features.  It replaces <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> as a backend to <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a>; see <a href="SV____SV-VERSUS-ESIM.html">sv::sv-versus-esim</a> for a comparison.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____X86ISA.html">x86isa</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Shilpi Goel, Warren A. Hunt, Jr., and Matt Kaufmann have 
 contributed a library, <span class="v">projects/x86isa/</span>, containing the 
 specification of the x86 instruction set architecture and utilities 
 to simulate and reason about x86 machine code.</p> 
 
 <h4>Other new books</h4> 
 
 <p>A toy cache coherency protocol called VI and its proof of 
  correctness have been contributed by Ben Selfridge and David Rager 
  in <span class="v">projects/cache-coherence/</span>. This effort takes an approach 
  that starts with a goal invariant and develops many helper 
  invariants while trying to prove this goal invariant.</p> 
 
 <p>David Russinoff has contributed a proof of the group axioms for 
 the addition operation on the elliptic curve known as 
 <span class="v">Curve25519</span>; these books can be found in 
 <span class="v">projects/curve25519/</span>. Another library in <span class="v">projects/shnf</span> 
 contains a formalization of the theory of sparse Horner normal forms 
 for integer polynomials.</p> 
 
 <p>Ben Selfridge has contributed his library <span class="v">projects/sb-machine</span> 
 that contains a formalization of the x86-TSO memory model. This model 
 contains a machine with multiple processors, a shared memory, and 
 store buffers.</p> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">demos/meta-wf-guarantee-example.lisp</span> has an example 
 that demonstrates the use of <span class="v">:well-formedness-guarantee</span> for 
 <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> rules</p> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">misc/install-not-normalized.lisp</span> installs an 
 unnormalized definition; see <a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED.html">install-not-normalized</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">hints/hint-wrapper.lisp</span> allows you to supply hints 
 in the statement of a theorem; see <a href="ACL2____HINT-WRAPPER.html">hint-wrapper</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">system/event-names.lisp</span> defines <a href="ACL2____EP.html">ep</a> and <a href="ACL2____EP-.html">ep-</a> to 
  return the list of event names (resp., excluding those events built 
  into ACL2) with a given case-insensitive prefix.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">system/termp.lisp</span> contains work done to verify the guards of 
  the ACL2 built-in function <a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new book <span class="v">tools/flag.lisp</span> creates a flag-based induction 
 scheme for a mutual recursion; see <a href="ACL2____MAKE-FLAG.html">make-flag</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>New timing tools like <a href="ACL2____ORACLE-TIME.html">oracle-time</a> and <span class="v">oracle-timelimit</span> 
 in <span class="v">tools/oracle-time.lisp</span> provide the run time and bytes 
 allocated during the execution of a form.</p> 
 
 <p>A new book <span class="v">tools/removable-runes.lisp</span> automatically computes 
    runes to disable in order to speed up a proof. See <a href="ACL2____REMOVABLE-RUNES.html">removable-runes</a>.</p>

 <h3>Changes to Existing Libraries</h3> 
 
 <h4>
<a href="ACL2____ACL2-SEDAN.html">ACL2-sedan</a> related books</h4> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">acl2s/defdata/defdata-attach.lisp</span>, which is used to 
 attach or modify metadata for a <a href="ACL2____DEFDATA.html">defdata</a> type, now truely uses 
 defattach for enumerators, i.e., enumerators have constant names that 
 can be attached to different enumerator functions. This facility thus 
 deprecates enum/test and separate test-enumerators. For now, most 
 enumerators are in <a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a> mode and non-guard-verified, and 
 hence, defattaching them requires trust-tags.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____CGEN.html">cgen</a> books have been updated as follows:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Support has been added for collecting statistics on which 
    hypotheses are failing in vacuous tests.</li> 
 
 <li>First-class support (e.g., for equality) has been added for 
    membership relation/constraint, i.e., member/enum has the same 
    status as range types.</li> 
 
 <li>Nested testable events like <span class="v">thm</span>, <span class="v">defthm</span>, etc. are not 
    supported anymore. This results in the simplification of the 
    <span class="v">event-stack</span> global to just a <span class="v">event-ctx</span> global, which 
    stores the <span class="v">ctx-form</span>. This simplification also allows us to 
    aim for a global timeout on cgen/testing thm/defthm forms.</li> 
 
 <li>Support for complex-rationals has been added in number 
    ranges.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2S____DEFUNC.html">ACL2s::defunc</a> books have been udpated as follows:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
  <li>The <span class="v">print-summary</span> event prints total time taken by 
    <span class="v">defunc</span> events.  Now time is only printed twice, once for 
    <span class="v">test?</span> and once for <span class="v">defunc</span> logical events. Both these 
    times are computed using <a href="ACL2____READ-RUN-TIME.html">read-run-time</a> ACL2 function and is 
    the accurate run time (not wall-clock time).</li> 
 
  <li>A new timeout abort event is inserted at the beginning of the 
    defunc/static/non-static events set (generated by 
    <span class="v">defunc-events-with-staticp-flag</span> function) . This event checks 
    if the elapsed time has exceeded the timeout limit and if it has, 
    then it aborts with an error and thus we fall through the outer 
    <span class="v">:OR</span> to the next choice.</li> 
 
  <li>The <span class="v">program-mode-p</span> predicate function now checks the 
   following: Is there a program-mode sub-function in the body?</li> 
 
  <li>The <span class="v">cgen-timeout</span> parameter is used to restrict time spent 
   by all the body contract testing as a global timeout.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The syntax for FUN binders <a href="ACL2____PATBIND-FUN.html">patbind-fun</a> has been extended to 
    allow inline/notinline declarations on the resulting <span class="v">FLET</span> 
    forms.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">b*</span> now requires that variables be bound to a form and it will 
 no longer treat <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">t</span> as aliases for <span class="v">&amp;</span>. Error 
 messages produced by <span class="v">b*</span> have been made more informative.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____BITOPS.html">bitops</a></h4> 
 
 <p> Reduction XOR related functions have been added to the 
 <span class="v">bitops</span> library in <a href="ACL2____PARITY.html">parity</a>. Lemmas in <a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2IHSEXT-BASICS.html">bitops::bitops/ihsext-basics</a> have been cleaned up. Theorems about 
 <a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> have been added for <a href="ACL2____ROTATE-RIGHT.html">rotate-right</a> and <a href="ACL2____ROTATE-LEFT.html">rotate-left</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A small book about <a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a> has been added: 
 <span class="v">centaur/bitops/floor.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>More slice and merge functions have been added in <a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2MERGE.html">bitops::bitops/merge</a>. Some <a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGER-LENGTH.html">integer-length</a> rules in 
 <span class="v">centaur/bitops/integer-length.lisp</span> have been changed to allow 
 better free variable matching.</p> 
 
 <h4>coi</h4> 
 
 <p>A new book for reasoning about modular arithmetic using <span class="v">nary</span> 
 congruences has been contributed; see 
 <span class="v">coi/nary/nary-mod.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Books in <span class="v">coi</span> have been updated so as to avoid name conflicts 
 with <span class="v">std</span> books.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">fty</span> books have been re-organized --- <span class="v">deftypes.lisp</span> 
 has been split up into different files, and tests have been moved to 
 a subdirectory <span class="v">tests/</span>. Performance problems with certain macros, 
 mostly related to reasoning about tag and kind functions, have been 
 fixed.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="FTY____DEFTRANSSUM.html">fty::deftranssum</a> has been extended to support nested <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>s.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____QUICKLISP.html">quicklisp</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The bundled quicklisp libraries have been updated.  The quicklisp 
books work only for ACL2 built on CCL or SBCL.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____RTL.html">rtl</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">rtl/rel11</span> books have seen many updates, courtesy of 
 Dmitry Nadezhin.</p> 
 
 <p>Guards have been added to functions in 
 <span class="v">rtl/rel11/lib/</span>. General cleanup of the <span class="v">rtl/rel11/</span> books, 
 like removing unnecessary hypotheses and <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>s, has 
 also been done.</p> 
 
 <p>New radix-aware versions of functions in <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/</span> 
 directory have been added. E.g., the old function <span class="v">bitn</span> has a 
 fixed radix of 2 and takes <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">n</span> as input arguments and 
 the new radix-aware version corresponding to this function is 
 <span class="v">digitn</span>, which takes the radix <span class="v">b</span> in addition to <span class="v">x</span> and 
 <span class="v">n</span> as inputs.</p> 
 
 <p>The books <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/basic.lisp</span>, 
 <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/bits.lisp</span>, 
 <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/float.lisp</span>, 
 <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/reps.lisp</span>, and 
 <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/masc.lisp</span> are now certifiable by ACL2(r).</p> 
 
 <p>Some books from <span class="v">rtl/rel11/rel9-rtl-pkg/lib</span>, like 
 <span class="v">reps.lisp</span>, <span class="v">rom-helpers.lisp</span>, and 
 <span class="v">simple-loop-helpers.lisp</span>, along with their supporters, have been 
 moved to <span class="v">rtl/rel11/support/</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Bugs in <span class="v">rtl/rel11/lib/excps.lisp</span> related to divide-by-zero 
 exception and the <span class="v">ep</span> exponent width in the function 
 <span class="v">convert-nan-to-op</span> have been fixed.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STD.html">std</a></h4> 
 
 <p>A new macro called <a href="ACL2____IMPLIEZ.html">impliez</a> has been added in 
 <span class="v">std/basic/defs.lisp</span>. This macro expands to an <a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a>, so 
 unlike <a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a>, guards in the consequent can be verified 
 assuming the antecedent.</p> 
 
 <p>New theorems about <a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> have been 
 added to <span class="v">std/lists/nth.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The guards of <a href="ACL2____LIST-EQUIV.html">list-equiv</a> in <span class="v">std/lists/list-defuns.lisp</span> 
 have been verified. The function <a href="ACL2____LIST-FIX.html">list-fix</a> was tweaked so that 
 it avoids consing if its input is indeed a <span class="v">true-listp</span>. A new 
 function <a href="ACL2____LLIST-FIX.html">llist-fix</a>, which is logically <span class="v">list-fix</span> but is 
 the identity function for execution, has been also added.</p> 
 
 <p>A possibly better non-CCL raw Lisp implementation of <a href="BITSETS____BIGNUM-EXTRACT.html">bitsets::bignum-extract</a> has been added.</p> 
 
 <p>A new rule <span class="v">pick-a-point-subset-constraint-helper</span> was added in 
    <span class="v">std/osets</span> to allow pick-a-point proofs to be used even when 
    subset is disabled.</p> 
 
 <p>For <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a>, <span class="v">defretd</span> has been added to go with 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFRET.html">defret</a>. Also, <span class="v">defret</span> now allows the <span class="v">otf-flg</span> 
 flag. <span class="v">:guard t</span> declarations in <span class="v">define</span> have been eliminated 
 if guards have already been provided. Also, information displayed by 
 <a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a> of functions introduced using <span class="v">define</span> has been cleaned 
 up using <a href="ACL2____PE-TABLE.html">pe-table</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new macro <a href="ACL2____RULE.html">rule</a> is a <span class="v">THM</span>-like version of <a href="ACL2____DEFRULE.html">defrule</a>.  <span class="v">Rule</span> and <span class="v">defrule</span> produce leaner output now, 
 almost identical to that produced by <span class="v">thm</span> and <span class="v">defthm</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a></h4> 
 
 <p>For details about changes made to VL, see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-7-2-VL.html">note-7-2-vl</a>.</p> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a></h4> 
 
 <p>Topics with missing parents are now placed under a new topic <a href="XDOC____MISSING-PARENTS.html">xdoc::missing-parents</a> instead of under <span class="v">top</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The title of xdoc manuals can be easily configured by editing 
 <span class="v">xdoc/fancy/config.js</span>. No warning about a redefined topic is 
 produced when the topic is identical to the original one.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">xdoc</span> now loads <span class="v">acl2-doc-wrap</span> instead of <span class="v">acl2-doc</span> so 
 that the loaded documentation doesn't overwrite the user's 
 topics.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug in <span class="v">see</span> that did not allow properly escaping the printed 
 name of a symbol has been fixed. The implementation of <a href="ACL2____DEFSECTION.html">defsection</a> had another bug that caused 'Definitions and 
 Theorems' section to be added to topics even when there were no 
 definitions or theorems in that section; this bug has been fixed as 
 well. Also, <span class="v">defsection</span> does not explicitly turn on error 
 printing during event submission anymore.</p> 
 
 <p>The output from <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">xdoc::save</a> now shows more timing 
 information.</p> 
 
 <p>Legacy stuff like <span class="v">write-acl2-xdoc</span>, <span class="v">:import</span> option with 
 <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">xdoc::save</a>, and <span class="v">xdoc-verbose</span> has been removed.</p> 
 
 <h4>Other Libraries</h4> 
 
 <p>A new book <span class="v">projects/codewalker/demo-fact-partial.lisp</span> is a 
 variant of <span class="v">projects/codewalker/demo-fact.lisp</span> that provides a 
 guide to how Codewalker might be modified so that termination proofs 
 can be avoided or delayed.</p> 
 
 <p>Multiple values and stobjs are now supported in the 
 <span class="v">coi/defung/</span> libraries.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">Must-fail</a> and related utilities in <span class="v">misc/eval.lisp</span> 
 produce much less output by default. Also, 
 <span class="v">make-event/eval-check.lisp</span> no longer duplicates code from 
 <span class="v">misc/eval.lisp</span>.  Instead, it defines <span class="v">!</span> utilities that 
 behave like the counterparts previously defined (without the <span class="v">!</span> 
 suffix).</p> 
 
 <p>A bug in <a href="ACL2____REMOVE-HYPS.html">remove-hyps</a> that occurred when no proof steps are 
 required in a proof has been fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <span class="v">tarai-measure</span> has been added in 
 <span class="v">coi/termination/assuming/complex.lisp</span>, which is allows this book 
 to certify quickly in ACL2(r) as well. Consequently, this book was 
 removed from <span class="v">SLOW_BOOKS</span> in <span class="v">books/GNUmakefile</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Some floating-point support has been added to the JVM M5 model; 
 see <span class="v">models/jvm/m5/m5.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> now displays a more informative error message about 
 duplicated indices in <span class="v">:g-bindings</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">Satlink</a> now uses <span class="v">drat-trim</span>, available at 
 <span class="v">tools/drat-trim/</span>, instead of <span class="v">drup-trim</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">tools/untranslate-for-exec.lisp</span> has been improved to 
 handle nested mv-lets.</p> 
 
 <h4>Deleted Books and Stubs</h4> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">defexec/other-apps/records/records-bsd.lisp</span> has been 
 deleted --- it was out of sync with <span class="v">records.lisp</span> in the same 
 directory.</p> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">make-event/assert-check-include-1.lisp</span> has been 
 deleted.</p> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">misc/dead-events.lisp</span> has been moved to 
 <span class="v">tools/dead-events.lisp</span>, and a relocation stub has been added in 
 the older location.</p> 
 
 <p>In the directory <span class="v">misc/</span>, <span class="v">*-bsd.lisp</span> books are now 
 <span class="v">reloc_stub</span> books.</p> 
 
 <p>Books in <span class="v">projects/concurrent-programs/german-protocol/</span> have 
 been moved to <span class="v">projects/cache-coherence/german-protocol/</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">rtl/rel10</span> has been removed from the community 
 books. These books were not in use anywhere in the contributed 
 books.</p> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">system/gather-dcls.lisp</span> has been deleted after its 
 contents were moved to 
 <span class="v">system/verified-termination-and-guards.lisp</span>.</p>

 <h3>Build System Updates</h3> 
 
 <h4><a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">cert.pl</span> documentation at <span class="v">build/doc.lisp</span> has been 
 moved to its own <span class="v">BUILD</span> package.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">cert.pl</span> now produces successful certification messages that 
 include times and color coding.  <span class="v">cert.pl</span> has also been patched 
 to correctly handle filenames with dollar signs. It has new options 
 for removing <span class="v">.cert.out</span> files after successful certifications and 
 for sending them to a temporary directory.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <a href="BUILD____CERT_F5PARAM.html">build::cert_param</a> for SMTLINK, <span class="v">uses-smtlink</span>, has 
    been added so that books using it will not be certified unless 
    supporting software such as Z3 is installed. Another 
    <span class="v">cert_param</span> called <span class="v">non-gcl</span> has been added.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <span class="v">CERT_PL_SHOW_HOSTNAME</span> environment variable has been 
 added to <span class="v">cert.pl</span> that can show the hostname after each book gets 
 certified.</p> 
 
 <h4>make system</h4>
