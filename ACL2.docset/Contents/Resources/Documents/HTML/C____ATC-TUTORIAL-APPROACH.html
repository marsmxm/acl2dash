<p>ATC tutorial: Approach to Generating C Code from ACL2.</p><p>ATC translates a subset of ACL2 to C. 
    The ACL2 subset is designed to be close to C, 
    i.e. to be essentially ``C written in ACL2'', 
    so that it is relatively easy to translate to C. 
    There is a direct translation to the C constructs 
    from their representation in ACL2.</p><p>ATC is meant to be used in conjunction with <a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a>. One uses APT transformations 
    to refine ACL2 specifications and code 
    to the subset recognized by ATC, which ATC translates to C. 
    Thus, ATC can be used at the end of an APT derivation.</p><p>Currently ATC recognizes a very limited subset of ACL2 
    and translates it to a very limited subset of C. 
    This is just a first step (the development of ATC has just started); 
    we plan to extend ATC to increasingly larger subsets of ACL2 and C.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Previous:</b> <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-ATJ-COMPARISON.html">Comparison with ATJ's Java code generation from ACL2</a></p><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-PROOFS.html">ACL2 Proofs Generated for the Generated C code</a></p>
