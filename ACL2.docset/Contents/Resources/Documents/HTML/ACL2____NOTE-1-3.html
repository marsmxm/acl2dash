<p>Acl2 Version 1.3 Notes</p><p><a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING.html">Programming</a> mode has been eliminated.  Instead, all 
 functions have a ``color'' which indicates what can be done with the function. 
 For example, <span class="v">:red</span> functions can be executed but have no axioms describing 
 them.  Thus, <span class="v">:red</span> functions can be introduced after passing a simple 
 syntactic check and they can be redefined without undoing.  But nothing of 
 consequence can be proved about them.  At the other extreme are <span class="v">:gold</span> 
 functions which can be executed and which also have passed both the 
 termination and the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> verification proofs.  The color of a function 
 can be specified with the new <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> keyword, <span class="v">:color</span>, which, if 
 omitted defaults to the global setting of <span class="v">ld-color</span>.  <span class="v">Ld-color</span> 
 replaces <span class="v">load-mode</span>.  Setting <span class="v">ld-color</span> to <span class="v">:red</span> causes behavior 
 similar to the old <span class="v">:g-mode</span>.  Setting <span class="v">ld-color</span> to <span class="v">:gold</span> causes 
 behavior similar to the old <span class="v">:v-mode</span>.  It is possible to prototype your 
 system in <span class="v">:red</span> and then convert <span class="v">:red</span> functions to <span class="v">:</span><span class="v">blue</span> 
 individually by calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a></span> on them.  They can then be 
 converted to <span class="v">:gold</span> with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span>.  This allows us to 
 undertake to verify the termination and <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s of system functions. 
 See <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> color for an introduction to the use of colors.</p> 
 
 <p>Type prescription rules have been added.  Recall that in Nqthm, some <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules were actually stored as ``<a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>s.''  Such 
 rules allow the user to inform Nqthm's primitive type mechanism as to the 
 kinds of shells returned by a function.  Earlier versions of Acl2 did not have 
 an analogous kind of rule because Acl2's type mechanism is complicated by 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s.  Version 1.3 supports <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Three more new <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> implement congruence-based rewriting. 
 It is possible to identify a binary relation as an equivalence relation (see 
 <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a>), to show that one equivalence relation refines another 
 (see <a href="ACL2____REFINEMENT.html">refinement</a>) and to show that a given equivalence relation is 
 maintained when rewriting a given function call, e.g., <span class="v">(fn ...xk...)</span>, by 
 maintaining another equivalence relation while rewriting the <span class="v">k</span>th argument 
 (see <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a>).  If <span class="v">r</span> has been shown to be an <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> 
 relation and then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> hyps (r (foo x) (bar x)))</span> is proved as a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule, then instances of <span class="v">(foo x)</span> will be replaced by 
 corresponding instances of <span class="v">(bar x)</span> provided the instance occurs in a slot 
 where the maintenance of <span class="v">r-equivalence</span> is known to be sufficient and 
 <span class="v">hyps</span> can be established as usual.</p> 
 
 <p>In Version 1.2, <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> were simple keywords, e.g., 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ELIM.html">elim</a></span>.  In Version 1.3, <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> have been elaborated to allow you to specify how the theorem 
 ought to be used as a rule.  That is, the new <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> allows you 
 to separate the mathematical statement of the formula from its interpretation 
 as a rule.  See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Rules used to be named by symbols, e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a></span> and <span class="v">car-cons</span> were 
 the names of rules.  Unfortunately, this was ambiguous because there are three 
 rules associated with function symbols: the symbolic definition, the 
 executable-counterpart, and the <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>; many different rules 
 might be associated with theorems, depending on the rule classes.  In Version 
 1.3 rules are named by ``<a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s'' (which is just short hand for ``rule 
 names'').  Example <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s are <span class="v">(:definition car)</span>, 
 <span class="v">(:executable-counterpart car)</span>, and <span class="v">(:type-prescription car . 1)</span>. 
 Every rule added by an event has a different name and you can <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a> 
 and <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> them independently.  See <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> and see <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The identity function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>, of one argument, has been added and 
 given a special interpretation by the functions responsible for establishing 
 hypotheses in backchaining: When the system fails to establish some hypothesis 
 of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> term)</span>, it simply assumes it is true and goes on, 
 delaying until later the establishment of term.  In particular, pushes a new 
 subgoal to prove term in the current context.  When that subgoal is attacked, 
 all of the resources of the theorem prover, not just rewriting, are brought to 
 bear.  Thus, for example, if you wish to prove the rule <span class="tt">(implies 
 (good-statep s) (equal (exec s n) s'))</span> and it is your expectation that 
 every time <span class="v">exec</span> appears its first argument is a <span class="v">good-statep</span> then you 
 might write the rule as <span class="tt">(implies (force (good-statep s)) (equal (exec s n) 
 s'))</span>.  This rule is essentially an unconditional rewrite of <span class="v">(exec s
 n)</span> to <span class="v">s'</span> that spawns the new goal <span class="v">(good-statep s)</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>.  Because you can now specify independently how a theorem is used as a 
 rule, you need not write the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> in the actual theorem proved.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Version 1.3 supports a facility similar to Nqthm's <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BREAK-LEMMA.html">break-lemma</a></span>. 
 See <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>.  You can install ``<a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>s'' on <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s 
 that will cause interactive breaks under certain conditions.</p> 
 
 <p>Acl2 also provides ``<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>s'' which allow you to write functions 
 that cause interaction with the user but which do not require that you have 
 access to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.  See <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The rewriter now automatically backchains to stronger recognizers.  There 
 is no user hook to this feature but it may simplify some proofs with which 
 older versions of Acl2 had trouble.  For example, if the rewriter is trying to 
 prove <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> (foo a b c))</span> it is now smart enough to try lemmas that 
 match with <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> (foo a b c))</span>.</p>
