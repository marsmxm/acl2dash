<p>What is a Mathematical Logic?</p><p><a href="ACL2____What_02is_02a_02Mechanical_02Theorem_02Prover_82Q_92.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/flying.gif"></div></a></p>

 <p>A mathematical logic is a formal system of formulas (<b>axioms</b>) and 
 <b>rules</b> for deriving other formulas, called <b>theorems</b>.</p> 
 
 <p>A <b>proof</b> is a derivation of a theorem.  To see a concrete proof tree, 
 click <a href="ACL2____A_02Trivial_02Proof.html">here</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Why should you care?  The neat thing about Theorems is that they are 
 ``true.''  More precisely, if all the axioms are valid and the rules are 
 validity preserving, then anything derived from the axioms via the rules is 
 valid.</p> 
 
 <p>So, if you want to determine if some formula is true, <b>prove it</b>.</p>
