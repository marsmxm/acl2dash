<p>Functions related to a module's namespace.</p><p>BOZO this is generally obviated by <a href="VL2014____SCOPESTACK.html">scopestack</a>.  New code 
shouldn't be written using modnamespace.</p> 
 
<p>Namespaces are discussed in Section 4.11 of the Verilog-2005 
standard.  In particular, note that ports and port declarations are given 
special treatment: they are said to be in a separate namespace which 
"overlaps" the regular module namespace.</p> 
 
<p>I think this distinction is only made so that you can refer to both ports and 
 to items in the regular module namespace from expressions, etc.  The 
 important consequence of this is that it is legal to write things such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">input x ;
wire x ;</pre> 
 
<p>Even though it would be illegal to declare x to be a wire twice, or as both a 
wire and a reg, and so on.</p> 
 
<p>At any rate, in this file we introduce a number of routines for extracting 
the names from lists of port declarations, net declarations, and so on.  These 
culminate in</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="VL2014____VL-MODULE-_E3MODNAMESPACE.html">VL-MODULE-&gt;MODNAMESPACE</a> X) : MODULE -&gt; STRING LIST</pre> 
 
<p>Which returns a list of all names found in the module's namespace.  Note 
that any reasonable module is required to have a unique modnamespace.</p> 
 
<p>BOZO this does not get named blocks.  Unclear how nested blocks are supposed 
to be handled.  We do at least get function and task names, and names from 
events.</p>
