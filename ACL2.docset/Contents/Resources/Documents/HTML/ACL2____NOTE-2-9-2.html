<p>ACL2 Version  2.9.2 (April, 2005) Notes</p><p>Also see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-9-1.html">note-2-9-1</a> for other changes since the last 
 non-incremental release 
 (Version_2.9).</p> 
 
 <p>There was a bug in non-linear arithmetic (see <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>) 
 that caused the following error:</p>

By the simple :definition BVECP, the :executable-counterparts of EXPT

HARD ACL2 ERROR in VARIFY:  This should not have happened.  The supposed
variable, '1/8388608, is instead a constant.

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Robert Krug for providing a fix for the above error.</p> 
 
 <p>Guard-checking was being inhibited (since v2-9) for calls of built-in 
 primitives on explicit values, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 3)</span>.  This has been fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>Guard-related warnings could be printed during proofs (this bug was 
 introduced in Version_2.9.1).  These warnings have been eliminated.</p> 
 
 <p>Compound-recognizer rules <span class="v">natp-compound-recognizer</span> and 
 <span class="v">posp-compound-recognizer</span> are now built into ACL2 for predicates <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POSP.html">posp</a></span>, and hence have been deleted from book 
 <span class="v">natp-posp.lisp</span> (where they were called <span class="v">natp-cr</span> and <span class="v">posp-cr</span>, 
 respectively).</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">file-clock-p</span>, which recognizes a component of the ACL2 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>, is now defined using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a></span> instead of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a></span>. 
 Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting this change.  (Technical explanation 
 about functions in ACL2 source file <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span>: With a <span class="v">file-clock</span> 
 of -1, the call of <span class="v">make-input-channel</span> in <span class="v">open-input-channel</span> will 
 create a channel that can't be closed; see the guard of 
 <span class="v">close-input-channel</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>(Allegro CL users only) Support is now provided for building an Allegro CL 
 application, provided you have an Allegro CL dynamic runtime license.  (Our 
 belief is that with such a license, many users can use the same application, 
 rather than each user needing a separate license.)  See new GNUmakefile target 
 <span class="v">allegro-app</span> and file <span class="v">build-allegro-exe.cl</span> for more information.</p> 
 
 <p>The new home page now contains a link to a new page 
 <span class="v">other-releases.html</span>, which contains information about other ACL2 
 releases.  (This is in one's local home page, but may not show up on the 
 central ACL2 home page until the next non-incremental release.)  Thanks to 
 Warren Hunt for suggesting this addition.</p> 
 
 <p>We thank Erik Reeber for suggesting a solution to output redirection using 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></span>, which we have described at the end of its documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>A new documentation topic fixes the flawed argument for conservativity of 
 the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span> event that appears in Appendix B of Kaufmann and Moore's 
 paper, ``Structured Theory Development for a Mechanized Logic'' (Journal of 
 Automated Reasoning 26, no. 2 (2001), pp. 161–203).  See <a href="ACL2____CONSERVATIVITY-OF-DEFCHOOSE.html">conservativity-of-defchoose</a>.  Thanks to John Cowles and Ruben Gamboa for 
 helpful feedback on drafts of this note.</p> 
 
 <p>The solution to exercise 6.15 in <span class="v">books/textbook/chap6/solutions.txt</span> 
 has been fixed.  Thanks to Aaron Smith for pointing out the problem.</p> 
 
 <p>A new documentation topic <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLE.html">defun-sk-example</a> gives a little more help 
 in using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> effectively.  Thanks to Julien Schmaltz for 
 presenting this example as a challenge.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) There is now a way to speed up GCL builds of ACL2, at the cost 
 of perhaps a percent or so in performance of the resulting image.  Using 
 `make' one supplies the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">LISP='gcl -eval "(defparameter user::*fast-acl2-gcl-build* t)"</pre> 
 
 <p>Various makefiles have been improved in several ways.</p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p>(1) Parallel book certification, using GNU make's <span class="v">-j</span> 
 option, can be used.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) Book certifications now stops at the first failure if 
 <span class="v">books/Makefile</span> or <span class="v">books/Makefile-generic</span> is used, and returns 
 non-zero exit status.  However, the various make targets in the ACL2 source 
 directory (<span class="v">regression</span>, <span class="v">certify-books</span>, etc.) still continue past 
 failures unless you provide <span class="v">ACL2_IGNORE=' '</span> on the `make' command 
 line.</p> 
 
 <p>(3) The build process has been modified (file <span class="v">GNUmakefile</span>) so that it 
 stops upon a failed compile or a failed initialization.</p> 
 
 <p>(4) The automatic dependency generation (from ``<span class="v">make dependencies</span>'' 
 has been improved so that commands of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> "my-book.lisp")</span> in 
 <span class="v">.acl2</span> files cause the appropriate dependencies to be 
 generated.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>Thanks to comments from several users that led to the above Makefile 
 improvements: Ray Richards, Doug Harper, and the Rockwell ACL2 users for (1) 
 and (2) (and inspiring (4)), and David Rager for (2) and (3).  In particular, 
 Doug Harper sent a replacement for the <span class="v">.date</span> mechanism, which was 
 interfering with <span class="v">make -n</span>; so, these files are no longer written.</p> 
 
 <p>A mechanism has been added for saving output.  In particular, you can now 
 call <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> on a file with output turned off, for efficiency, and yet when 
 a proof fails you can then display the proof attempt for the failed (last) 
 event.  See set-saved-output.  Another new command — see <a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-CLAUSE-IDS.html">set-print-clause-ids</a> — causes subgoal numbers to be printed during 
 proof attempts when output is inhibited.</p> 
 
 <p>Documentation has been added for using ACL2's makefile support to automate 
 the certification of collections of books.  See <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION-CLASSIC.html">books-certification-classic</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a></span> that was causing hard Lisp 
 errors.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW-GSTACK.html">cw-gstack</a></span> to allow a <span class="v">:frames</span> argument to specify a 
 range of one or more frames to be printed.  see <a href="ACL2____CW-GSTACK.html">cw-gstack</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command <span class="v">forwardchain</span>.  Thanks to 
 Ming-Hsiu Wang for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>We have provided a mechanism for saving an executable image.  See <a href="ACL2____SAVING-AND-RESTORING.html">saving-and-restoring</a> and see <a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a>.  We have eliminated obsolete 
 functions <span class="v">note-lib</span> and <span class="v">make-lib</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GROUND-ZERO.html">ground-zero</a></span> <a href="ACL2____THEORY.html">theory</a> so that it contains all of 
 the built-in rules (in ACL2 source file <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span>).  It had formerly 
 failed to include rules from some definitions and theorems near the end of 
 <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new event, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-ENFORCE-REDUNDANCY.html">set-enforce-redundancy</a></span>, allows the enforcement of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, and most other events during book development. 
 See <a href="ACL2____SET-ENFORCE-REDUNDANCY.html">set-enforce-redundancy</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug has been fixed that had allowed <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHEORY.html">deftheory</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> to 
 cause a hard Lisp error when calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a></span> on ill-formed 
 theories after, for example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:set-guard-checking nil
(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a> '((:rewrite no-such-rule))
                           (<a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a> 'ground-zero)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The handling of <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> checking has been modified somewhat in a way 
 that should only very rarely affect users.  (An ``Essay on Guard Checking'' in 
 the ACL2 source code explains this point to anyone interested in 
 implementation details.)</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL ONLY) Removed the -dir setting in the ACL2 wrapper script for GCL. 
 This should generally have no effect for most users, but it eliminates a 
 potential source of error down the road.</p> 
 
 <p>Several interesting new definitions and lemmas have been added to the rtl 
 library developed at AMD, and incorporated into <span class="v">books/rtl/rel4/lib/</span>. 
 Other book changes include a change to lemma <span class="v">truncate-rem-elim</span> in 
 <span class="v">books/ihs/quotient-remainder-lemmas.lisp</span>, as suggested by Jared 
 Davis.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REAL_F2RATIONALP.html">real/rationalp</a></span> may now be referred to in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> and <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>, thanks to a new <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a></span> event.  Thanks to Jared Davis for this suggestion.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 terms of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> p 'nil 't)</span> are now printed as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> p)</span>, 
 where in some setting they had been printed as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> p) t)</span>.  Thanks 
 to Robert Krug for this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL ONLY) Added profiling support, based heavily on code supplied by Camm 
 Maguire.  See file <span class="v">save-gprof.lsp</span> for instructions.  Thanks to Camm, and 
 also to David Hardin for inspiring this addition.</p> 
 
 <p>Added support for preprocessing before printing (untranslating) a term. 
 See <a href="ACL2____USER-DEFINED-FUNCTIONS-TABLE.html">user-defined-functions-table</a>, in particular the discussion of 
 <span class="v">untranslate-preprocess</span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for inspiring this 
 addition, and for providing a book that takes advantage of it 
 (<span class="v">books/misc/untranslate-patterns.lisp</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>The documentation has been improved for explaining how <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s are 
 assigned; see <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>.  Thanks to Robert Krug for pointing out 
 inaccuracies in the existing documentation.</p>
