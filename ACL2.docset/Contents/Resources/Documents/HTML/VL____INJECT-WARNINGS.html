<p>Mechanism for attaching <a href="VL____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> to particular modules or 
other design elements.</p><p>Warnings from the early stages of parsing (e.g., lexing and 
preprocessing) are created well before we have any modules (or other kinds of 
descriptions, e.g., interfaces) to attach them to.  By convention, we create 
these warnings so that their first argument is the location.  When warnings 
follow this convention, we can attempt to associate them with modules.</p> 
 
<p>Note: we generally don't expect there to be too many warnings caused during 
these stages of loading, so our injection code is not particularly 
efficient.</p>
