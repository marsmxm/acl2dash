<p>Fixtype of identifiers [C:6.4.2].</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name â€” <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>For now we represent C identifiers as ACL2 strings, 
     which suffice to represent all the ASCII C identifiers. 
     We wrap ACL2 strings into a one-field product fixtype 
     to make it easier to modify or extend this fixtype in the future.</p><p>ASCII identifiers may be, in fact, 
     all that we need in the foreseeable future: 
     we may not need to generate C programs with 
     identifiers that include non-ASCII characters, 
     some aspects of which may be 
     implementation-dependent or locale-dependent. 
     Since ASCII identifiers are portable, 
     we plan for ATC to generate only ASCII identifiers, 
     unless there will be reasons to support a broader range.</p><p>Unconstrained ACL2 strings may not be valid C ASCII identifiers. 
     ATC will always generate ACL2 strings that are, 
     but in the future we may extend this fixtype 
     with suitably restrictions on the ACL2 string.</p><p>A C implementation may limit 
     the number of significant characters in identifiers [C:5.2.4.1], 
     to 31 for external identifiers and 63 for internal identifiers. 
     In the interest of portability, 
     it is our intention to have ATC 
     generate identifiers of 31 characters or less, 
     which may not be a significant limitation. 
     In the future, we may add this constraint to this fixtype.</p>
