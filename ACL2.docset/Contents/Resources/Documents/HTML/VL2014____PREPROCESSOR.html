<p>Limited preprocessor for Verilog.</p><p>First, a warning.  In general, the Verilog specification does not 
cover how preprocessing is to be done in a very complete way.  We are left with 
many subtle questions about how the preprocessor should behave, and to resolve 
these questions we have sometimes just given test cases to simulators such as 
Verilog-XL, NCVerilog, and VCS.  This is not a very satisfying state of 
affairs.</p> 
 
<h4>Supported Directives</h4> 
 
<p>Our preprocessor has pretty good support for the <span class="v">define</span>- and 
<span class="v">ifdef</span>-related directives:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>define</li> 
 <li>ifdef</li> 
 <li>ifndef</li> 
 <li>elsif</li> 
 <li>else</li> 
 <li>undef</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>We place some (reasonable) restrictions on the above macros.  For instance, 
we do not allow definitions to include most compiler directivesâ€”we allow 
the body of <span class="v">`foo</span> to include <span class="v">`bar</span>, but not <span class="v">`endif</span>.  These 
restrictions are intended to ensure that we do not "mispreprocess" anything. 
See <a href="VL2014____PREPROCESSOR-IFDEF-MINUTIA.html">preprocessor-ifdef-minutia</a> for some details and additional 
discussion.</p> 
 
<p>We also have pretty good support for <span class="v">`include</span> directives.  This is 
quite underspecified, and we have basically tried to mimic the behavior of 
Verilog-XL and NCVerilog.  See also <a href="VL2014____PREPROCESSOR-INCLUDE-MINUTIA.html">preprocessor-include-minutia</a>.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Ignored Directives</h4> 
 
<p>We also "support" certain directives by <b>ignoring</b> them.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li><span class="v">`celldefine</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`endcelldefine</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`resetall</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`timescale</span></li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>When we say we ignore these directives, we mean that the preprocessor 
literally removes them from the source code that the lexer sees.  No record of 
these directives is ever kept.  A consequence of this is, upon having loaded 
some VL modules, there is not really any way to know whether these directives 
were included anywhere in the source code.</p> 
 
<p>In the case of <span class="v">celldefine</span> and <span class="v">endcelldefine</span>, this seems pretty 
reasonable.  It seems that these directives only mark modules as "cells" for 
certain PLI directives or other tools.  None of the tools we are developing 
care about this, so for now we just ignore this directive.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">resetall</span> directive is tool dependent and it seems valid to ignore 
it entirely.  We do not try to enforce the restriction that <span class="v">resetall</span> must 
not occur within a module definition.</p> 
 
<p>We also ignore <span class="v">timescale</span> directives.  This is not ideal, but is pretty 
reasonable for things like ESIM where timing is irrelevant.  It is also fairly 
reasonable even for something like a transistor analyzer that cares about unit 
delays, as long as differnet timescales are not being mixed together.  (Mixing 
timescales within a single design seems insane, and after all what is the 
"default" timescale supposed to be?  BOZO maybe add a warning if more than 
one kind of timescale is seen.</p> 
 
<p>As future work, there might be some benefit to somehow preserving these 
directives so that they can be printed out again in the simplified Verilog we 
produce.  That is, maybe it would make the simplified Verilog easier to use as 
a "drop-in replacement" for the unsimplified Verilog.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Unsupported Directives</h4> 
 
<p>We currently make no attempt to support:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li><span class="v">`begin_keywords</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`default_nettype</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`end_keywords</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`line</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`pragma</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`nounconnected_drive</span></li> 
 <li><span class="v">`unconnected_drive</span></li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>It might be good to ignore <span class="v">`begin_keywords "1364-2005"</span> and just cause 
an error if a different set of keywords is requested.  We could also ignore 
<span class="v">`end_keywords</span>.  But trying to add anything more sophisticated than this 
seems very tricky and messy.</p> 
 
<p>It would be good to add proper support for <span class="v">`line</span>.  Failing that, it 
would be quite easy to just ignore it, like the other ignored directives.  We 
should probably also ignore <span class="v">`pragma</span> directives, and this should be easy to 
do.</p> 
 
<p>It would be somewhat difficult to support <span class="v">`default_nettype</span> and 
<span class="v">`unconnected_drive</span>.  Probably the thing to do would be build a table of 
when the declarations are made, and then use some trick like comment injection 
to mark modules appropriately.  We would then have to change the <a href="VL2014____MAKE-IMPLICIT-WIRES.html">make-implicit-wires</a> transform to consider the <span class="v">`default_nettype</span> for the 
module, and probably use a separate transform to handle <span class="v">`unconnected_drive</span> 
stuff.</p>
