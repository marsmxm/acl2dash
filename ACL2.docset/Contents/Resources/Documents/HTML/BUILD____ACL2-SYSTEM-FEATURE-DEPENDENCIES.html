<p>Automatically forcing recertification when changes in the ACL2 sources 
          would invalidate a certificate.</p><p>In principle, every time the ACL2 system changes, all books should 
be recertified.  However, in practice many users don't do this because the ACL2 
system is updated frequently and it is time-consuming to rebuild all the 
community books.  But sometimes a change to the ACL2 system makes certain books 
no longer work correctly until they are recertified.  For example, the book 
<span class="v">system/apply/apply-prim</span> uses the value of 
<span class="v">*first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities*</span>, a constant defined by the ACL2 
system, in a make-event form in order to define <span class="v">apply$-prim-meta-fn-ev</span>. 
If the value of that constant changes, that book should be recertified; 
otherwise, books that depend on it might fail to certify.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">GNUMakefile</span> provided with the ACL2 community books provides a 
mechanism to force certain books to be recertified when the values of constants 
built into the ACL2 system change.  To fix <span class="v">apply-prim</span> using this 
mechanism, we add a comment to the book:</p> 
<pre class="code">; (depends-on "build/first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities.certdep" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>This forces <span class="v">apply-prim</span> to be recertified if that file changes. We 
arrange for this file to change by running ACL2 at the start of each invocation 
of the community books' <span class="v">GNUMakefile</span> and comparing the value of 
<span class="v">*first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities*</span> to the object read from 
<span class="v">build/first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities.certdep</span>.  If those objects 
differ, then the current <span class="v">*first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities*</span> is 
written to that file, which then forces <span class="v">apply-prim</span> to be recertified.</p> 
 
<p>It is fairly easy to add dependencies on other ACL2 features: simply add a 
new invocation of <span class="v">write-file-if-obj-differs</span> to 
<span class="v">build/cert_features.lsp</span>, similar to the ones that already exist there. 
For example, the one used in the example above is:</p> 
<pre class="code">(write-file-if-obj-differs "first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities.certdep"
                           *first-order-like-terms-and-out-arities*
                           state)</pre> 
<p>Then add dependencies using <span class="v">depends-on</span> comments in the books that 
depend on the current value of that constant.</p> 
 
<p>The cert.pl build system by itself does not update these files, which means 
that Makefiles that use cert.pl will not support this feature unless they run 
the <span class="v">cert_features.lsp</span> script on startup, like <span class="v">books/GNUMakefile</span> does. 
A workaround is to invoke <span class="v">books/GNUMakefile</span> after any rebuild of ACL2, 
before using cert.pl alone or using a separate Makefile:</p> 
<pre class="code">cd acl2/books
make build/Makefile-features</pre> 
<p>Cert.pl and cert.pl-generated Makefiles will arrange for files 
<span class="v">build/%.certdep</span> to be created if they do not exist, so that books that 
depend on them can still be certified using cert.pl alone.</p> 
 
<p>Cert.pl also makes every certificate depend on two special certdep files: 
<span class="v">build/acl2-version.certdep</span> and <span class="v">build/universal-dependency.certdep</span>. 
The former is updated by <span class="v">cert_features.lsp</span> like the others, containing the 
current ACL2 version string; this forces all books to be recertified when the 
ACL2 version number changes.  The latter, unlike the others, is stored in the 
ACL2 git repository.  It may be updated by ACL2 maintainers to force all books 
to be recertified when they make other changes that require this, or by 
community members who notice that such a change has been made without a 
corresponding update.</p>
