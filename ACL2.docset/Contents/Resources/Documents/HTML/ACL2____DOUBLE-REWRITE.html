<p>Cause a term to be rewritten twice</p><p>Logically, <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> is the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IDENTITY.html">identity</a></span> function: 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a> x)</span> is equal to <span class="v">x</span>.  However, the ACL2 rewriter treats 
 calls of <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> in the following special manner.  When it 
 encounters a term <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a> u)</span>, it first rewrites <span class="v">u</span> in the 
 current context, and then the rewriter rewrites the result.</p> 
 
 <p>Such double-rewriting is rarely necessary, but it can be useful when 
 rewriting under non-trivial equivalence relations (see <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a>). 
 The following example will illustrate the issue.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; Define an equivalence relation.
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> my-equiv (x y)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> x y))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFEQUIV.html">defequiv</a> my-equiv)

; Define a unary function whose argument is preserved by my-equiv.
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x)

  t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a> my-equiv equal (foo x) 1)

; Define some other unary functions.
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (x) x)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> h1 (x) x)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> h2 (x) x)

; Prove some lemmas and then disable the functions above.
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> lemma-1

(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNION-THEORIES.html">union-theories</a> (<a href="ACL2____THEORY.html">theory</a> 'minimal-theory)
                           '(lemma-1 lemma-2 lemma-3
                             my-equiv-implies-equal-foo-1)))

; Attempt to prove a simple theorem that follows ``obviously'' from the
; events above.
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (h1 a)) (h1 a)))</pre> 
 
 <p>We might expect the proof of this final <span class="v">thm</span> to succeed by the 
 following reasoning.  It is immediate from <span class="v">lemma-3</span> provided we can 
 establish <span class="v">(foo (h1 a))</span>.  By the <span class="v">defcong</span> event above, we know that 
 <span class="v">(foo (h1 a))</span> equals <span class="v">(foo (h2 a))</span> provided <span class="v">(my-equiv (h1 a) (h2
 a))</span>; but this is immediate from <span class="v">lemma-1</span>.  And finally, <span class="v">(foo (h2
 a))</span> is true by <span class="v">lemma-2</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Unfortunately, the proof fails.  But fortunately, ACL2 gives the following 
 useful warning when <span class="v">lemma-3</span> is submitted:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFTHM LEMMA-3 ...):  In the :REWRITE
rule generated from LEMMA-3, equivalence relation MY-EQUIV is maintained
at one problematic occurrence of variable X in hypothesis (FOO X),
but not at any binding occurrence of X.  Consider replacing that occurrence
of X in this hypothesis with (<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">DOUBLE-REWRITE</a> X).  See :doc double-
rewrite for more information on this issue.</pre> 
 
 <p>We can follow the warning's advice by changing <span class="v">lemma-3</span> to the 
 following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> lemma-3
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (foo (<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a> x))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x) x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>With this change, the proof succeeds for the final <span class="v">thm</span> above.</p> 
 
 <p>In practice, it should suffice for users to follow the advice given in the 
 ``<span class="v">Double-rewrite</span>'' warnings, by adding calls of <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> 
 around certain variable occurrences.  But this can cause inefficiency in large 
 proof efforts.  For that reason, and for completeness, it seems prudent to 
 explain more carefully what is going on; and that is what we do for the 
 remainder of this <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topic.  Optionally, also see the paper 
 ``Double Rewriting for Equivalential Reasoning in ACL2'' by Matt Kaufmann and 
 J Strother Moore, in the proceedings of the 2006 ACL2 Workshop (paper is 
 published in the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/toc.cfm?id=1217975" target="_blank"><nobr>ACM

 <p><b>Suggesting congruence rules.</b></p> 
 
 <p>Sometimes the best way to respond to a ``<span class="v">Double-rewrite</span>'' warning may 
 be to prove a congruence rule.  Consider for example this rule.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> insert-sort-is-id
  (perm (insert-sort x) x))</pre> 
 
 <p>Assuming that <span class="v">perm</span> has been identified as an <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> 
 relation (see <a href="ACL2____DEFEQUIV.html">defequiv</a>), we will get the following warning.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Warning [Double-rewrite] in ( DEFTHM INSERT-SORT-IS-ID ...):
In a :REWRITE rule generated from INSERT-SORT-IS-ID, equivalence relation
PERM is maintained at one problematic occurrence of variable X in the
right-hand side, but not at any binding occurrence of X.  Consider
replacing that occurrence of X in the right-hand side with
(<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">DOUBLE-REWRITE</a> X).  See :doc double-rewrite for more information on
this issue.</pre> 
 
 <p>The problem is that the second occurrence of <span class="v">x</span> (the right-hand side of 
 the rule <span class="v">insert-sort-is-id</span>) is in a context where <span class="v">perm</span> is to be 
 maintained, yet in this example, the argument <span class="v">x</span> of <span class="v">insert-sort</span> on 
 the left-hand side of that rule is in a context where <span class="v">perm</span> will not be 
 maintained.  This can lead one to consider the possibility that <span class="v">perm</span> 
 could be maintained in that left-hand side occurrence of <span class="v">x</span>, and if so, to 
 prove the following congruence rule.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a> perm perm (insert-sort x) 1)</pre> 
 
 <p>This will eliminate the above warning for <span class="v">insert-sort-is-id</span>.  More 
 important, this <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></span> event would probably be useful, since it would 
 allow rewrite rules with equivalence relation <span class="v">perm</span> to operate on the 
 first argument of any call of <span class="v">insert-sort</span> whose context calls for 
 maintaining <span class="v">perm</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Details on double-rewrite.</b></p> 
 
 <p>The reader who wants these details may first wish to see <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> 
 for relevant review.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 rewriter takes a number of contextual arguments, including the 
 generated equivalence relation being maintained (see <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a>) and an 
 association list that maps variables to terms.  We call the latter alist the 
 <span class="v">unify-subst</span> because it is produced by unifying (actually matching) a 
 pattern against a current term; let us explain this point by returning to the 
 example above.  Consider what happens when the rewriter is given the top-level 
 goal of the <span class="v">thm</span> above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (h1 a)) (h1 a))</pre> 
 
 <p>This rewrite is performed with the empty alist (<span class="v">unify-subst</span>), and is 
 begun by rewriting the first argument (in that same empty 
 <span class="v">unify-subst</span>):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (h1 a))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that the only equivalence relation being maintained at this point is 
 <span class="v">equal</span>.  Now, the rewriter notices that the left-hand side of 
 <span class="v">lemma-3</span>, which is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x)</span>, matches <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (h1 a))</span>.  The rewriter thus 
 creates a <span class="v">unify-subst</span> binding <span class="v">x</span> to <span class="v">(h1 a)</span>: <span class="v">((x . (h1 a)))</span>. 
 It now attempts to rewrite the hypothesis of <span class="v">lemma-3</span> to <span class="v">t</span> under this 
 <span class="v">unify-subst</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider what happens now if the hypothesis of <span class="v">lemma-3</span> is <span class="v">(foo
 x)</span>.  To rewrite this hypothesis under a <span class="v">unify-subst</span> of <span class="v">((x . (h1
 a)))</span>, it will first rewrite <span class="v">x</span> under this <span class="v">unify-subst</span>.  The key 
 observation here is that this rewrite takes place simply by returning the 
 value of <span class="v">x</span> in the <span class="v">unify-subst</span>, namely <span class="v">(h1 a)</span>.  No further 
 rewriting is done!  The efficiency of the ACL2 rewriter depends on such 
 caching of previous rewriting results.</p> 
 
 <p>But suppose that, instead, the hypothesis of <span class="v">lemma-3</span> is <span class="v">(foo
 (<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a> x))</span>.  As before, the rewriter dives to the first argument of 
 this call of <span class="v">foo</span>.  But this time the rewriter sees the call 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a> x)</span>, which it handles as follows.  First, <span class="v">x</span> is 
 rewritten as before, yielding <span class="v">(h1 a)</span>.  But now, because of the call of 
 <span class="v">double-rewrite</span>, the rewriter takes <span class="v">(h1 a)</span> and rewrites it under the 
 empty <span class="v">unify-subst</span>.  What's more, because of the <span class="v">defcong</span> event above, 
 this rewrite takes place in a context where it suffices to maintain the 
 equivalence relation <span class="v">my-equiv</span>.  This allows for the application of 
 <span class="v">lemma-1</span>, hence <span class="v">(h1 a)</span> is rewritten (under <span class="v">unify-subst</span> = 
 <span class="v">nil</span>) to <span class="v">(h2 a)</span>.  Popping back up, the rewriter will now rewrite the 
 call of <span class="v">foo</span> to <span class="v">t</span> using <span class="v">lemma-2</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The example above explains how the rewriter treats calls of 
 <span class="v">double-rewrite</span>, but it may leave the unfortunate impression that the user 
 needs to consider each <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rule 
 carefully, just in case a call of <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> may be appropriate. 
 Fortunately, ACL2 provides a ``[Double-rewrite]'' warning to inform the user 
 of just this sort of situation.  If you don't see this warning when you submit 
 a (<span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>) rule, then the issue 
 described here shouldn't come up for that rule.  Such warnings may appear for 
 hypotheses or right-hand side of a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule, and for 
 hypotheses or full conclusion (as opposed to just the trigger term) of a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rule.</p> 
 
 <p>If you do see a ``[Double-rewrite]'' warning, then should you add the 
 indicated call(s) of <span class="v">double-rewrite</span>?  At the time of writing this <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>, the answer is not clear.  Early experiments with double 
 rewriting suggested that it may be too expensive to call <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> 
 in every instance where a warning indicates that there could be an advantage 
 to doing so.  And at the time of this writing, the ACL2 regression suite has 
 about 1900 such warnings (but note that books were developed before 
 <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> or the ``[Double-rewrite]'' warning were implemented), 
 which suggests that one can often do fine just ignoring such warnings. 
 However, it seems advisable to go ahead and add the calls of 
 <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> indicated by the warnings unless you run across efficiency 
 problems caused by doing so.  Of course, if you decide to ignore all such 
 warnings you can execute the event:<br> 
 
 <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a></span><span class="v"> "Double-rewrite")</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, we note that it is generally not necessary to call 
 <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> in order to get its effect in the following case, where 
 the discussion above might have led one to consider a call of 
 <span class="v">double-rewrite</span>: a hypothesis is a variable, or more generally, we are 
 considering a variable occurrence that is a branch of the top-level <span class="v">IF</span> 
 structure of a hypothesis.  The automatic handling of this case, by a form of 
 double rewriting, was instituted in ACL2 Version_2.9 and remains in place with 
 the introduction of <span class="v">double-rewrite</span>.  Here is a simple illustrative 
 example.  Notice that <span class="v">foo-holds</span> applies to prove the final <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span> 
 below, even without a call of <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> in the hypothesis of 
 <span class="v">foo-holds</span>, and that there is no ``[Double-rewrite]'' warning when 
 submitting <span class="v">foo-holds</span>.</p>
