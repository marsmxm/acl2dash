<p>Fixtype of assignments.</p><p>These are assignments of field elements to variables, 
     used to express the semantics of PFCS 
     (see <a href="PFCS____SEMANTICS-DEEPLY-EMBEDDED.html">semantics-deeply-embedded</a>).</p><p>Since the type of field elements depends on the prime, 
     we use natural numbers here, 
     which are a superset of every possible prime field. 
     This way, we can have a fixtype of assignments 
     (recall that fixtypes cannot be parameterized, currently).</p>
