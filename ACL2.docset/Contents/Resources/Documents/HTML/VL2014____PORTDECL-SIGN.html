<p>Fix up type (signedness) information between port and variable 
declarations.</p><p>This is a very early transform that should be run almost 
immediately.  It needs to be run after <a href="VL2014____MAKE-IMPLICIT-WIRES.html">make-implicit-wires</a>.  It 
is ordinarily run as part of <a href="VL2014____VL-ANNOTATE-DESIGN.html">vl-annotate-design</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Port and variable declarations have a strange overlap with certain 
subtleties.  In some cases, the port declaration is "complete" and also gives 
rise to a net declaration.  For instance, the declaration of <span class="v">a</span> below 
introduces both a port declaration and a net declaration:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module mymod (a, b, c, ...) ;

  input wire [3:0] a;   // &lt;-- combined port and net declaration
                        //     illegal to subsequently declare wire [3:0] a.

endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>In other cases, the port declaration is "incomplete," and it is legal 
to subsequently declare the same name as a net or variable.  For instance, 
the following is valid even though it looks like <span class="v">b</span> is declared twice:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module mymod (a, b, c, ...) ;

  input [3:0] b;   // &lt;-- port declaration
  wire [3:0] b;    // &lt;-- corresponding net declaration

endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>But incomplete port declarations do not require that an corresponding net 
declaration be explicitly present.  For instance, if we simply omit the <span class="v">wire
[3:0] b</span> part from the above example, we implicitly get an equivalent net 
declaration.</p> 
 
<p>A particularly subtle part of this is that signedness information can be 
given in either the port or the net declaration.  For instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module mymod (a, b, c, d, ...) ;

  input [3:0] c;          //  c becomes signed because the
  wire signed [3:0] c;    //  net declaration says so

  input signed [3:0] d;   //  d becomes signed because the
  wire [3:0] d;           //  port declaration says so

endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>To cope with this, after introducing implicit wires, we cross-propagate type 
information between incomplete port declarations and their corresponding net 
declarations.  The general goal is to ensure that the types of the ports and 
nets agree and are correct by the time actual modules are produced.</p>
