<p>Efficient operations for concatenating fixed-sized bit vectors.</p><p>We now introduce many operations that concatenate together bit 
vectors of some fixed size to create a new, merged bit vector.  For example, 
<a href="ACL2____MERGE-4-U8S.html">merge-4-u8s</a> joins together four 8-bit vectors into a 32-bit result.</p> 
 
<p>In general, the function <a href="ACL2____LOGAPP.html">logapp</a> is a more flexible alternative to the 
operations belowâ€”it can be used to merge bit vectors of different sizes. 
However, since it can only merge two bit-vectors at a time, using <span class="v">logapp</span> 
directly can become quite tedious when you have a lot of vectors to merge.  For 
instance, these merging operations may be especially useful for describing SIMD 
style operations, byte swapping operations, and so forth.</p> 
 
<p>Each of our merging operations is logically simple.  However, we go to some 
lengths to make them execute more efficiently.  This is accomplished by 
providing ample <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SPEC.html">ACL2::type-spec</a> declarations and arranging the order of 
operations to use fixnums for as long as possible.  This provides significant 
speedups, for instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">;; logic mode version: 11.112 seconds
;; exec mode version:   1.404 seconds
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((a7 1)
      (a6 2)
      (a5 3)
      (a4 4)
      (a3 5)
      (a2 6)
      (a1 7)
      (a0 8))
  (time (loop for i fixnum from 1 to 100000000 do
              (<a href="ACL2____MERGE-8-U8S.html">merge-8-u8s</a> a7 a6 a5 a4 a3 a2 a1 a0))))</pre> 
 
<p>Note that when designing these functions, we typically assume that fixnums 
are large enough to hold 56-bit results.  Our definitions should therefore 
perform well on 64-bit Lisps including at least CCL and SBCL.</p> 
 
<p>We prove that each merge produces a result of the correct size (expressed as 
a theorem about <a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a>), and that it has a <a href="ACL2____NAT-EQUIV.html">nat-equiv</a> 
<a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">ACL2::congruence</a> for each of its arguments.</p>
