<p>Basic check for declaration-time assignments to <span class="v">logic</span> variables.</p><p>SystemVerilog encourages logic designers to use <span class="v">logic</span> 
variables to avoid having to distinguish between nets and regs.  But a 
fundamental problem with this is that declaration-time assignments to regs and 
nets are very different.  For instance,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire [3:0] foo1 = a + b;   // Continuous assignment to foo1
reg [3:0] foo2 = a + b;    // One-time, initial assignment to foo2</pre> 
 
<p>Since <span class="v">logic</span> variables act like regs here, a logic designer who 
writes</p> 
 
<pre class="code">logic [3:0] foo3 = a + b;</pre> 
 
<p>gets a one-time, initial value assignment to <span class="v">foo3</span>, which is quite 
possibly not at all what they meant if they've been led to believe that 
<span class="v">logic</span> is a new, wonderful replacement for both <span class="v">wire</span> or <span class="v">reg</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Here we just implement a completely stupid check to look for 
declaration-time assignments of variables.  If we see an assignment to a 
<span class="v">reg</span> variable we don't complain, but if we see an assignment to something 
else we issue a warning.</p>
