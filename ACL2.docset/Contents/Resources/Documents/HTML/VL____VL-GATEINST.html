<p>Representation of a single gate instantiation.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>type — <a href="VL____VL-GATETYPE-P.html">vl-gatetype-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>What kind of gate this is, e.g., <span class="v">and</span>, <span class="v">xor</span>, <span class="v">rnmos</span>, 
              etc.</dd> 
 
<dt>args — <a href="VL____VL-PLAINARGLIST.html">vl-plainarglist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Arguments to the gate instance.  Note that this differs from 
              module instances where <a href="VL____VL-ARGUMENTS-P.html">vl-arguments-p</a> structures are used, 
              because gate arguments are never named.  The grammar restricts 
              how many arguments certain gates can have, but we do not enforce 
              these restrictions in the definition of <span class="v">vl-gateinst-p</span>.</dd> 
 
<dt>loc — <a href="VL____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Where the gate instance was found in the source code.</dd> 
 
<dt>name — <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>The name of this gate instance, or <span class="v">nil</span> if it has no name; 
              see also the <a href="VL____ADDNAMES.html">addnames</a> transform.</dd> 
 
<dt>atts — <a href="VL____VL-ATTS.html">vl-atts</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Any attributes associated with this gate instance.</dd> 
 
<dt>range — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-RANGE.html">vl-maybe-range</a>
</dt> 
<dd>When present, indicates that this is an array of instances 
              instead of a single instance.</dd> 
 
<dt>strength — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-GATESTRENGTH.html">vl-maybe-gatestrength</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The parser leaves this as <span class="v">nil</span> unless it is explicitly provided. 
              Note from Section 7.8 of the Verilog-2005 standard that pullup 
              and pulldown gates are special in that the strength0 from a 
              pullup source and the strength1 on a pulldown source are supposed 
              to be ignored.  <b>Warning:</b> in general we have not paid much 
              attention to strengths, so we may not handle them correctly in 
              our various transforms.</dd> 
 
<dt>delay — <a href="VL____VL-MAYBE-GATEDELAY.html">vl-maybe-gatedelay</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The parser leaves this as <span class="v">nil</span> unless it is explicitly provided. 
              Certain gates (tran, rtran, pullup, and pulldown) never have 
              delays according to the Verilog grammar, but this is only 
              enforced by the parser, and is not part of our <span class="v">vl-gateinst-p</span> 
              definition.  <b>Warning:</b> as with strengths, we have not paid 
              much attention to delays, and our transforms may not handle them 
              correctly.</dd> 
 
</dl><p><span class="v">vl-gateinst-p</span> is our representation for any single gate 
instance (or instance array).</p> 
 
<p>The grammar for gate instantiations is quite elaborate, but the various 
cases are so regular that a unified representation is possible.  Note that the 
Verilog grammar restricts the list of expressions in certain cases, e.g., for 
an <span class="v">and</span> gate, the first expression must be an lvalue.  Although our parser 
enforces these restrictions, we do not encode them into the definition of 
<span class="v">vl-gateinst-p</span>.</p>
