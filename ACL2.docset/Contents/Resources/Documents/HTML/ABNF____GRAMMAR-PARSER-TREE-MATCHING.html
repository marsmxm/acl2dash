<p>Tree matching theorems for the parser of ABNF grammars.</p><p>If parsing succeeds, 
     the returned tree(s) match(es) the syntactic entities being parsed. 
     For instance, if <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____PARSE-ALPHA.html">parse-alpha</a></span> succeeds, 
     the returned tree matches <span class="v">ALPHA</span>.</p><p>The tree matching proof of each parsing function uses, as rewrite rules, 
     the tree matching theorems of the parsing functions called by 
     the parsing function whose theorem is being proved.</p><p>The tree matching theorems use hypotheses of the form 
     <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> element ...)</span> or <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> repetition ...)</span>, 
     where <span class="v">element</span> and <span class="v">repetition</span> are variables 
     that appear in the theorems' conclusions 
     as the second arguments of 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-match-element-p</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-MATCH-REPETITION-P.html">tree-list-match-repetition-p</a></span>, 
     and where <span class="v">...</span> are constant terms 
     that evaluate to certain elements and repetitions. 
     The reason for not substituting these hypotheses in the conclusions 
     is so that these theorems can be used as rewrite rules 
     when proving the tree matching theorems for the calling parsing functions. 
     Consider, for example, 
     how the tree matching theorem <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-OF-PARSE-ALPHA.html">tree-match-of-parse-alpha</a></span> 
     is used in the proof of <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-OF-PARSE-ALPHA_F2DIGIT_F2DASH.html">tree-match-of-parse-alpha/digit/dash</a></span>: 
     the goal</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-match-element-p</a>
   ... (<a href="ABNF_____12_F5.html">!_</a> (<a href="ABNF_____F2_F5.html">/_</a> *alpha*) (<a href="ABNF_____F2_F5.html">/_</a> *digit*) (<a href="ABNF_____F2_F5.html">/_</a> "-")) ...)</pre><p>simplifies (via the executable counterpart rules) to</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-match-element-p</a>
   ... '(:group (((:repetition (:repeat 1 (:finite 1))
                  (:rulename (:rulename "alpha"))))
                ((:repetition (:repeat 1 (:finite 1))
                  (:rulename (:rulename "digit"))))
                 ((:repetition (:repeat 1 (:finite 1))
                  (:char-val (:insensitive "-")))))) ...)</pre><p>and then reduces to, among others, the subgoal</p><pre class="code">(<a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-match-element-p</a>
   ... '(:rulename (:rulename "alpha")) ...)</pre><p>which would not match 
     <span class="v">(<a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-match-element-p</a> ... (<a href="ABNF____ELEMENT-RULENAME.html">element-rulename</a> *alpha*) ...)</span> 
     if that were the conclusion of <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-OF-PARSE-ALPHA.html">tree-match-of-parse-alpha</a></span>. 
     We could substitute the fully evaluated quoted constants 
     into the conclusions of the tree matching theorems 
     (e.g. <span class="v">'(:rulename (:rulename "alpha"))</span> 
     in <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-OF-PARSE-ALPHA.html">tree-match-of-parse-alpha</a></span>), 
     but this would be slightly more inconvenient and less readable, 
     especially when the elements are not simple rule elements.</p><p>In the tree matching theorems for the mutually recursive parsing functions 
     (i.e. <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____PARSE-ALTERNATION.html">parse-alternation</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____PARSE-CONCATENATION.html">parse-concatenation</a></span>, etc.), 
     the extra variables <span class="v">element</span> and <span class="v">repetition</span> 
     in the <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> element ...)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> repetition ...)</span> hypotheses 
     would lead to an unprovable induction structure 
     because the variables <span class="v">element</span> and <span class="v">repetition</span> 
     are the same in the induction hypotheses and conclusions, 
     but are equated to different constant terms. 
     Thus, we first prove by induction versions of the theorems 
     with the equalities substituted in the conclusions 
     (i.e., the <span class="v">tree-match-...-lemma</span> and <span class="v">tree-list-match-...-lemma</span> 
     theorems), 
     and then we prove the desired theorems, with the equality hypotheses. 
     The latter are used as rewrite rules in the tree matching proofs 
     for the parsing functions that call 
     the mutually recursive parsing functions.</p><p>The tree matching proofs also use the definitions of 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-_E3STRING.html">tree-&gt;string</a></span>, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-match-element-p</a></span>, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-MATCH-REPETITION-P.html">tree-list-match-repetition-p</a></span>, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-list-match-element-p</a></span>, 
     and <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____NUMREP-MATCH-REPEAT-RANGE-P.html">numrep-match-repeat-range-p</a></span>. 
     We enable these definitions just before the tree matching theorems 
     and we disable them just after. 
     Since in some theorems 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-match-element-p</a></span> does not get expanded 
     in places where it should 
     (presumably due to ACL2's heuristics for expanding recursive functions), 
     we use explicit <span class="v">:expand</span> hints in those theorems; 
     the potential looping due to the mutually recursive grammar rules 
     (for <span class="v">alternation</span>, <span class="v">concatenation</span>, etc.) does not happen, 
     presumably thanks to the firing of the tree matching rewrite rules 
     as soon as they apply. 
     There is no direct use of the definitions of 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-LIST-MATCH-ALTERNATION-P.html">tree-list-list-match-alternation-p</a></span> and 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-LIST-MATCH-CONCATENATION-P.html">tree-list-list-match-concatenation-p</a></span> 
     because the alternations and concatenations in these theorems 
     always have an explicit list structure and thus rewrite rules like 
     <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-LIST-MATCH-ALTERNATION-P-OF-CONS-ALTERNATION.html">tree-list-list-match-alternation-p-of-cons-alternation</a></span> suffice.</p><p>For some parsing functions that parse repetitions, 
     the tree matching theorems say that the returned trees match 
     not only the repetitions (via <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-MATCH-REPETITION-P.html">tree-list-match-repetition-p</a></span>), 
     but also the repeated elements (via <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-list-match-element-p</a></span>). 
     This is because subgoals involving <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____TREE-LIST-MATCH-ELEMENT-P.html">tree-list-match-element-p</a></span> 
     arise in the tree matching theorems 
     of the callers of such parsing functions.</p>
