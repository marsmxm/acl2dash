<p>top-level API function for Cgen/testing.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p> This is the main API function to test/check a form for counterexamples with 
the full power of prove (and hints), i.e. <span class="v">prove/cgen</span> actually calls 
<span class="v">prove</span> as a subfunction. You can accomplish the same thing using <span class="v">thm,
defthm</span> with the acl2s defaults parameter <span class="v">testing-enabled</span> set to <span class="v">T</span>, 
but this function gives the user/caller more control: the user is responsible 
to pass <span class="v">cgen-state</span> (use <span class="v">make-cgen-state</span> to construct one), that 
provides the <i>context</i> for cgen/testing; the results and statistics 
summarizing Cgen/testing are collected in cgen-state and this is returned to 
the caller. </p> 
 
<h3>General Form:</h3> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="CGEN____PROVE_F2CGEN.html">prove/cgen</a> form hints cgen-state state) =&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp cgen-state state)</pre> 
 
<p> The <span class="v">erp</span> part of result is <span class="v">nil</span>, if call to <span class="v">prove</span> was 
successful, it is <span class="v">:falsifiable</span> if there is at least one 
counterexample (not necessarily top-level), it is <span class="v">t</span> if there was a error 
in trans-eval call of prove (usually a hard/raw lisp error), it is <span class="v">:?</span> 
otherwise, which points out that we could neither prove nor disprove the 
conjecture under consideration </p> 
 
<h3>Example</h3> 
 
<p> For an example of the use of <span class="v">prove/cgen</span>, you can study the 
implementation of the <span class="v">test?</span> macro itself found in cgen/top.lisp. To see 
the structure of <span class="v">cgen-state</span>, you can study the 
<span class="v">print-testing-summary-fn</span> function which deconstructs it and prints its 
information in a human-readable form. </p>
