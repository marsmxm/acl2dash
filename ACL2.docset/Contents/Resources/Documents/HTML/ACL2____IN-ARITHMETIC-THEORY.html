<p>Designate theory for some rewriting done for non-linear arithmetic</p><p>We assume familiarity with <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>; in particular, see 
 <a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> for the normal way to set the current theory.  Here, we 
 discuss an analogous event that pertains only to non-linear arithmetic 
 (see <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Example:
(<a href="ACL2____IN-ARITHMETIC-THEORY.html">in-arithmetic-theory</a> '(lemma1 lemma2))

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____IN-ARITHMETIC-THEORY.html">in-arithmetic-theory</a> term)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">term</span> is a term that when evaluated will produce a theory (see 
 <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>).  Except for the variable <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a></span>, <span class="v">term</span> must 
 contain no free variables.  <span class="v">Term</span> is evaluated with the variable <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a></span> bound to the current <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> to obtain a theory and the 
 corresponding runic theory (see <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>) is then used by non-linear 
 arithmetic (see <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Warning: If <span class="v">term</span> involves macros such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a></span> you will probably not get what you expect!  Those macros are defined 
 relative to the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a></span>.  But in this context you might wish 
 they were defined in terms of the ``<span class="v">CURRENT-ARITHMETIC-THEORY</span>'' which is 
 not actually a defined function.  We do not anticipate that users will 
 repeatedly modify the arithmetic theory.  We expect <span class="v">term</span> most often to be 
 a constant list of runes and so have not provided ``arithmetic theory 
 manipulation functions'' analogous to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a></span>.</p>
