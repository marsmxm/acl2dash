<p>(atomic macro) 
split the current goal into cases</p><pre class="code">Example:
split</pre> 
 
 <p>For example, if the current goal has one hypothesis <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> x y)</span> and a 
 conclusion of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> a b)</span>, then <span class="v">split</span> will create four new goals:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">one with hypothesis X and conclusion A
one with hypothesis X and conclusion B
one with hypothesis Y and conclusion A
one with hypothesis Y and conclusion B.

General Form:
SPLIT</pre> 
 
 <p>Replace the current goal by subgoals whose conjunction is equivalent 
 (primarily by propositional reasoning) to the original goal, where each such 
 goal cannot be similarly split.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> The new goals will all have their hypotheses promoted; in 
 particular, no conclusion will have a top function symbol of <span class="v">implies</span>. 
 Also note that <span class="v">split</span> will fail if there is exactly one new goal created 
 and it is the same as the existing current goal.</p> 
 
 <p>The way <span class="v">split</span> really works is to call the ACL2 theorem prover with 
 only simplification (and preprocessing) turned on, and with only a few 
 built-in functions (especially, propositional ones) enabled, namely, the ones 
 in the list <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____THEORY.html">theory</a> 'minimal-theory)</span>.  However, because the prover is 
 called, type-set reasoning can be used to eliminate some cases.  For example, 
 if <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> x)</span> is in the hypotheses, then probably <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a>
 x))</span> will be reduced to <span class="v">t</span>.</p>
