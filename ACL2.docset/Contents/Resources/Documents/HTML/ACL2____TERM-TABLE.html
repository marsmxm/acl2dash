<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____TERM-TABLE">Click for Term-table in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A table used to validate meta rules</p><pre class="code">Example:
(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> term-table t '((<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a> x y) '3 'nil (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> for a general discussion of tables and the <span class="v">table</span> 
 event used to manipulate tables.</p> 
 
 <p>The ``<span class="v">term-table</span>'' is used at the time a meta rule is checked for 
 syntactic correctness.  Each proposed metafunction is run on each term in this 
 table, and the result in each case is checked to make sure that it is a 
 <span class="v">termp</span> in the current world.  In each case where this test fails, a 
 warning is printed.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, when a metafunction is run in support of the application of a 
 meta rule, the result must be a term (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a></span>) in the current world. 
 When the result is not a term, a hard error arises.  (However, see the last 
 paragraph below.)  The <span class="v">term-table</span> is simply a means for providing 
 feedback to the user at the time a meta rule is submitted, warning of the 
 definite possibility that such a hard error will occur at some point in the 
 future.</p> 
 
 <p>The key used in <span class="v">term-table</span> is arbitrary.  The top-most value is always 
 the one that is used; it is the entire list of terms to be considered.  Each 
 must be a <span class="v">termp</span> in the current ACL2 world.</p> 
 
 <p>The runtime check on the output of metafunctions can be avoided by proving 
 that it will always succeed (see <a href="ACL2____WELL-FORMEDNESS-GUARANTEE.html">well-formedness-guarantee</a>) or by 
 telling ACL2 to skip the test at the risk of soundness (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-SKIP-META-TERMP-CHECKS.html">set-skip-meta-termp-checks</a></span>).</p>
