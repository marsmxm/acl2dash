<p>Use <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> to reason about finitely bounded values.</p>It is often convenient to use as much automation as possible when 
  performing proofs.  <a href="ACL2____GL.html">Gl</a> provides the ability to automatically reason 
  about finite values, such as 32-bit integers.  As examples, this can be quite 
  useful when reasoning about cryptography algorithms or verifying hardware.
