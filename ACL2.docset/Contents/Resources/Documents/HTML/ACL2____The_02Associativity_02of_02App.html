<p>The Associativity of App</p><p><a href="ACL2____The_02Theorem_02that_02App_02is_02Associative.html"><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/walking.gif"></div></a></p>

 <pre class="code">ACL2!&gt;<b>(let ((a '(1 2))</b> 
            <b>(b '(3 4))</b> 
            <b>(c '(5 6)))</b> 
        <b>(equal (app (app a b) c)</b>

 <p>Observe that, for the particular <span class="v">a</span>, <span class="v">b</span>, and <span class="v">c</span> above, <span class="v">(app
 (app a b) c)</span> returns the same thing as <span class="v">(app a (app b c))</span>.  Perhaps 
 <span class="v">app</span> is <b>associative</b>.  Of course, to be associative means that the 
 above property must hold for all values of <span class="v">a</span>, <span class="v">b</span>, and <span class="v">c</span>, not 
 just the ones <b>tested</b> above.</p> 
 
 <p>Wouldn't it be cool if you could type</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2!&gt;<b>(equal (app (app a b) c)</b> 
             <b>(app a (app b c)))</b> 
 
</pre> 
 
 <p>and have ACL2 compute the value <span class="v">T</span>?  Well, <b>you can't!</b> If you try 
 it, you'll get an error message!  The message says we can't evaluate that form 
 because it contains <b>free</b> variables, i.e., variables not given values. 
 Click <a href="ACL2____Free_02Variables_02in_02Top-Level_02Input.html">here</a> to 
 see the message.</p> 
 
 <p>We cannot evaluate a form on an infinite number of cases.  But we can prove 
 that a form is a theorem and hence know that it will always evaluate to 
 true.</p>
