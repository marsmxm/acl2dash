<p>Fixtype of integer constants [C:6.4.4.1].</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5>

</dt> 
 
</dl><p>For now we define a C integer constants as consisting of 
     a natural number, a base, an unsigned flag, and a type suffix. 
     While this does not cover every syntactic aspect of an integer constant, 
     it covers the important ones.</p><p>The natural number is the value. 
     In base 10, the value has a unique syntactic representation, 
     because it is required to start with no 0. 
     In C, <span class="v">0</span> is always an octal integer constant, 
     so our abstract syntax here captures a bit more, 
     namely a decimal integer constant 0 that does not exist in C. 
     This is not an issue for now, 
     because our pretty-printer turns that into <span class="v">0</span> 
     in the same way as if it were octal.</p><p>In base 8, the value has a unique syntactic representation 
     if we assume exactly one leading 0, 
     which is not a significant limitation.</p><p>In base 16, the value has a unique syntactc representation 
     if we assume no leading 0s and either lowercase or uppercase letters 
     (i.e. we do not capture the difference between 
     the hexadecimal digits <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">A</span>). 
     This is not a very severe limitation, 
     even though sometimes one may like to write 
     something like <span class="v">0x0000ffff</span>. 
     We also do not capture the distinction between 
     the hexadecimal prefixes <span class="v">0x</span> and <span class="v">0X</span>.</p><p>We do not capture the distinction between the <span class="v">u</span> and <span class="v">U</span>, 
     which is not very important. 
     Also see <span class="tt"><a href="C____ICONST-TYSUFFIX.html">iconst-tysuffix</a></span> for a discussion about 
     uppercase and lowercase type suffixes.</p>
