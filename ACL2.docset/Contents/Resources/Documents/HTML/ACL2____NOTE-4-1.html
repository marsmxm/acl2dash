<p>ACL2 Version  4.1 (September, 2010) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we roughly organize the changes since Version 4.1 into the following 
 categories of changes: existing features, new features, heuristic 
 improvements, bug fixes, distributed books, Emacs support, and experimental 
 versions.  Each change is described in just one category, though of course 
 many changes could be placed in more than one category.</p> 
 
 <p><b>CHANGES TO EXISTING FEATURES</b></p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> associated with calls of the macro, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SEARCH.html">search</a></span>, has 
 been weakened so that now, given strings are no longer restricted to contain 
 only standard characters unless the <span class="v">:test</span> argument is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-EQUAL.html">char-equal</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified the writing of ``hidden <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>'' forms into <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> files (see <a href="ACL2____HIDDEN-DEFPKG.html">hidden-defpkg</a>), to support moving certificate 
 files for distributed books, as is done by ACL2s (see <a href="ACL2____ACL2-SEDAN.html">ACL2-sedan</a>) and 
 Debian releases of ACL2.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for reporting a problem with 
 Debian releases of ACL2 that led to this change.</p> 
 
 <p>Expanded the constant <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span> by adding <span class="v">intersection-equal</span> 
 to the list.  Thanks to Jared Davis for requesting this change.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span> utility now compiles functions that have code 
 conditionalized for raw Lisp only (presumably because a trust tag was active 
 when they were defined).  Previously, this was not the case when <span class="v">:comp</span> 
 was applied to more than a single function symbol.</p> 
 
 <p><b>NEW FEATURES</b></p> 
 
 <p>A new macro, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TOP-LEVEL.html">top-level</a></span>, allows evaluation directly in the top level 
 loop for forms that normally need to be evaluated inside function bodies, such 
 as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-LOCAL-STOBJ.html">with-local-stobj</a></span>.  See <a href="ACL2____TOP-LEVEL.html">top-level</a>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 requesting such a utility.</p> 
 
 <p>Added <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____COUNT.html">count</a></span>, a Common Lisp function, to ACL2.  In support of that 
 addition, also added rewrite rule <span class="v">eqlablep-nth</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>HEURISTIC IMPROVEMENTS</b></p> 
 
 <p>[None this time.]</p> 
 
 <p><b>BUG FIXES</b></p> 
 
 <p>We fixed a soundness bug that could occur when a function that returns 
 multiple values that is called in its own guard.  Thanks to Sol Swords for 
 reporting this bug and sending a small self-contained example, which is 
 included in a comment in the function <span class="v">chk-acceptable-defuns1</span> in ACL2 
 source file <span class="v">defuns.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>It was possible to cause an error when giving theory hints during 
 redefinition of functions.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to Ian Johnson for 
 sending an example that nicely illustrated this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed system function <span class="v">io?</span> for the case that formal parameter 
 <span class="v">commentp</span> is <span class="v">t</span> and <span class="v">vars</span> is non-empty.  Thanks to David Rager for 
 bringing to our attention the fact that <span class="v">io?</span> was broken for such a 
 combination of parameters.</p> 
 
 <p>Not exactly a bug fix, but: <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> was breaking when a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span> is specified, so we have improved the documentation (see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a>) to explain how to provide verified guards for a function 
 introduced by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing this issue 
 to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Made a fix to the handling of interrupts, which in rare cases might have 
 left one in a state where all subsequent proof attempts were labeled as 
 ``Aborting due to an interrupt''.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a></span> and related utilities, so that when proof output is 
 redirected to a file, all summary output goes to that file rather than to the 
 terminal.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL on Windows only) Removed an inappropriate check, resulting in an error 
 about ``pathname-device,'' that could prevent Windows GCL builds of ACL2. 
 Thanks to Camm Maguire for reporting this problem and a helpful 
 discussion.</p> 
 
 <p>(Windows only) Modified the computation of canonical pathnames to avoid 
 issues of case-insensitivity, in particular for the drive (e.g., <span class="v">"C:"</span> 
 vs. <span class="v">"c:"</span>).  Thanks to Harsh Raju Chamarthi for reporting this issue and 
 helping with its debugging.</p> 
 
 <p>(Windows only) The value of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> distributed-books-dir)</span> no longer will 
 be missing the Windows drive prefix, for example, <span class="v">"C:"</span>.  Thanks to 
 Harsh Raju Chamarthi for reporting this issue and helping with its 
 debugging.</p> 
 
 <p><b>NEW AND UPDATED BOOKS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE</b></p> 
 
 <p>See the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/source/list" target="_blank"><nobr>log 
 entries<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://code.google.com/p/acl2-books/source/list"></nobr></a> for a record of books changed or added since the preceding 
 release, with log entries.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified <span class="v">books/Makefile-generic</span> by adding a new <span class="v">BOOKS_SKIP_COMP</span> 
 variable, which is used in <span class="v">Makefile</span>s in some subdirectories of 
 <span class="v">books/</span>, in order to avoid errors when compiling certified books for 
 multiple Lisps.</p> 
 
 <p><b>EMACS SUPPORT</b></p> 
 
 <p>Distributed file <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> has been modified so that the 
 forms <span class="v">control-t e</span> and <span class="v">control-t control-e</span> now pick up package 
 markers (see <a href="ACL2____SHARP-BANG-READER.html">sharp-bang-reader</a>), in the following sense: if the 
 top-level form is preceded by a line starting with <span class="v">#!</span>, then that line is 
 included in the inserted string.  Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting this 
 enhancement and providing a preliminary implementation.</p> 
 
 <p><b>EXPERIMENTAL VERSIONS</b></p> 
 
 <p>For the <span class="v">HONS</span> version there have been some changes to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a></span>:</p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">Memoize</a></span> accepts a new keyword, <span class="v">:recursive</span>, that is 
 a synonym for the existing keyword <span class="v">:inline</span>.  Thanks to Sol Swords for 
 requesting this addition.  Moreover, it is now enforced that these keywords 
 have Boolean values.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">Memoize</a></span> may now be called on <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions. 
 Thanks to Sol Swords for requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug has been fixed.  Now, if <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a></span> is called with a 
 <span class="v">:condition-fn</span> (with value other than <span class="v">nil</span> or <span class="v">t</span>), then the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of the memoized function and the <span class="v">:condition-fn</span> must be the same. 
 Previously, one could exploit the lack of such a check to get a hard Lisp 
 error, for example as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) x)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> cf (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))
(<a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a> 'f :condition-fn 'cf)
(f 3)</pre> 
 
 <p>Memoization is now illegal for built-in functions that use underlying raw 
 Lisp in their implementations.  To see why, consider the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____GC_42.html">gc$</a>)</span>, 
 which is a macro call expanding to <span class="v">(gc$-fn nil)</span>.  Previously, after 
 evaluation of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a> 'gc$-fn)</span>, a call of <span class="v">gc$</span> would no longer call 
 the garbage collector, which had been invoked by raw Lisp code.  Now, 
 evaluation of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a> 'gc$-fn)</span> causes an error.</p>
