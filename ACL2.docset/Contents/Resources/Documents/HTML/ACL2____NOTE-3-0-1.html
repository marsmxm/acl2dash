<p>ACL2 Version  3.0.1 (August, 2006) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the 
 documentation has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a soundness bug, introduced in the previous release, due to a failure 
 to disallow <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> that set the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span> in a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> context.  Here is a proof of <span class="v">nil</span> 
 that exploits the bug.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> ()
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a>))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo ()
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :measure 17))
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1 (foo))))
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a>
 nil
 :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> foo (foo)) :use foo)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in the alternatives to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a></span>, which are the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXIT.html">exit</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____QUIT.html">quit</a></span> commands.  Thanks to Jared Davis and Peter Dillinger 
 for pointing this out right away.</p> 
 
 <p>The definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LEN.html">len</a></span> has been highly optimized in raw Lisp. 
 Thanks to Bob Boyer and Warren Hunt for suggesting such an improvement and 
 providing a lot of help in coming up with the current implementation.</p> 
 
 <p>The clause subsumption algorithms have been improved, both to improve 
 efficiency during warnings for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules and to punt when 
 the subsumption computation for induction appears to be blowing up.  Thanks to 
 Robert Krug for bringing this issue to our attention and supplying a useful 
 example.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug has been fixed that prevented <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span> from working properly in 
 OpenMCL and multi-threaded SBCL (actually, in any ACL2 image where feature 
 <span class="v">:acl2-mv-as-values</span> is present).  Thanks to Sol Swords for bringing this 
 problem to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>A <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a> of the form <span class="v">(satisfies pred)</span> carries the 
 requirement that <span class="v">pred</span> be a unary function symbol in the current ACL2 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>; otherwise, it is illegal.  Thanks to Dave Greve for pointing out 
 that Common Lisp has this requirement.</p> 
 
 <p>Installed a fix provided by Gary Byers (for ACL2 source function 
 <span class="v">install-new-raw-prompt</span>), for OpenMCL, that fixes an issue exposed in some 
 versions of OpenMCL when compiler optimization is off.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in contributed book <span class="v">misc/untranslate-patterns.lisp</span> that 
 was causing calls of <span class="v">add-untranslate-pattern</span> to be rejected in <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  Thanks to Ray Richards for pointing out this bug and to Jared Davis 
 for assisting in the fix.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> when keywords <span class="v">:initially</span> and 
 <span class="v">:resizable</span> are both supplied.  In this case, the definition of the 
 resizing function mistakenly failed to quote the <span class="v">:initially</span> value, even 
 though this value is not to be evaluated.  One could even get an error in this 
 case, as in the following example supplied by Erik Reeber, whom we thank for 
 bringing this bug to our attention:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> $test
  (test-x :type (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ARRAY.html">array</a> t (5)) :initially (0) :resizable t))</pre> 
 
 <p>A new feature, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a></span>, allows the setting of time 
 limits during proofs.  This is <b>not</b> a general-purpose time-limit 
 utility, nor is it guaranteed to implement a strict bound; it only attempts to 
 limit time approximately during proofs.  Thanks to Pete Manolios and Daron 
 Vroon, who made the most recent request for such a feature, and to Robert Krug 
 for a helpful discussion.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) Fixed a bug in the procedure for building a profiling image. 
 Thanks to Sol Swords for bringing this bug to our attention and to Eric Smith 
 for bringing a subsequent problem to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Handling of <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a> can now use significantly less time and space. 
 A regression suite run took about 25% longer before this change than it did 
 after making this change (and also the ones in the next two paragraphs). 
 Thanks to Vernon Austel for bringing this issue to our attention and for 
 supplying code, quite some time ago, that provided detailed, useful 
 implementation suggestions.  Also thanks to the folks at Rockwell Collins, 
 Inc. for pushing the limits of the existing implementation, thus encouraging 
 this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a performance bug in obtaining executable counterpart symbols.</p> 
 
 <p>We now avoid certain computations made on behalf of warnings, when such 
 warnings are disabled.</p> 
 
 <p>We have relaxed the checks made when including an uncertified book, to 
 match the checks made when including a certified book.  Thanks to Eric Smith 
 for suggesting this change.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a></span> (see set-saved-output) that caused an 
 error when printing the time summary.</p> 
 
 <p>Made fixes to avoid potential hard Lisp errors caused by the use of 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions.  The fix was to use a ``safe mode,'' 
 already in use to prevent such errors during macroexpansion; see <a href="ACL2____GUARDS-AND-EVALUATION.html">guards-and-evaluation</a>.  However, such errors were possible during evaluation 
 of macro <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s, for example as follows:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :mode :program))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> mac (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (foo 3)))
  x)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (x)
  (mac x))</pre> 
 
 <p>A similar issue existed for calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></span>, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span>, and <span class="v">value-triple</span>, but has been fixed 
 for all but <span class="v">in-theory</span> and <span class="v">make-event</span>, where technical issues have 
 caused us to defer this change.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="v">wet</span> that caused problems in OpenMCL, and perhaps other 
 Lisp implementations, when the argument to <span class="v">wet</span> calls, or depends on, 
 certain built-ins including <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span>, and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-BE-EQUAL.html">must-be-equal</a></span>.  Thanks to David Rager for bringing this problem to our 
 attention.</p> 
 
 <p>The file <span class="v">books/Makefile-generic</span> has been improved so that when book 
 certification fails with `make', the failure message contains the book 
 filename.</p> 
 
 <p>Documentation has been written to explain how to avoid an expensive 
 immediate rewrite of the result of applying a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> or 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> rule.  See <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>.  Thanks to Robert Krug for 
 supplying this trick, and to Eric Smith and Dave Greve for useful 
 discussions.</p> 
 
 <p>(OpenMCL only) OpenMCL-based ACL2 image names formerly had extension 
 <span class="v">".dppccl"</span>, which was correct only for some platforms (including 32-bit 
 Darwin PPC).  That has been fixed, thanks to a suggestion from Gary Byers.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now legal to attach both a <span class="v">:use</span> and a <span class="v">:cases</span> hint at the 
 same goal.  Thanks to Eric Smith for (most recently) requesting this 
 feature.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now permissible to include the same symbol more than once in the 
 imports list of a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> form (i.e., its second argument).  Also, the 
 evaluation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> forms with long import lists now uses a 
 reasonably efficient sorting routine to check for two different symbols with 
 the same name (see also <span class="v">books/misc/sort-symbols.lisp</span>).  If you currently 
 call a function like <span class="v">remove-duplicates-eql</span> for your imports list, as had 
 been suggested by a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> error message, then you may experience some 
 speed-up by removing that call.  Thanks to Eric Smith for helping to discover 
 this issue through profiling.</p> 
 
 <p>Made miscellaneous efficiency improvements not listed above (for example, 
 following a suggestion of Eric Smith to avoid checking for so-called ``bad 
 Lisp objects'' during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, which saved almost 3% in time on 
 one large example).</p> 
 
 <p>Modified the notion of ``untouchable'' to separate the notion of 
 untouchable functions and macros from the notion of untouchable state global 
 variables.  See <a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a>.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for sending an 
 example, <span class="v">(put-global 'ld-evisc-tuple t state)</span>, that suggested to us the 
 need for more restrictive handling of untouchables.  In particular, many 
 <span class="v">ld</span> specials (see <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a>) are now untouchable.  You may be able to work 
 around this restriction by calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>; see for example the change to 
 <span class="v">books/misc/expander.lisp</span>.  But please contact the ACL2 implementors if 
 this sort of workaround does not appear to be sufficient for your 
 purposes.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in function <span class="v">set-standard-oi</span> (see <a href="ACL2____STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in the use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-EVISC-TUPLE.html">ld-evisc-tuple</a></span>.  The bad behavior was an 
 improper use of the print-level and print-length components of the tuple 
 (specifically, taking its <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CADDR.html">caddr</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CADDDR.html">cadddr</a></span> instead of taking 
 its <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CADR.html">cadr</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CADDR.html">caddr</a></span>).  Thanks to Bob Boyer for bringing this 
 bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>A new argument to the <span class="v">compile-flg</span> argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, 
 <span class="v">:all</span>, causes creation of a file to be compiled in place of the given 
 book, where that file contains not only a copy of the book (with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> forms expanded) but also contains definitions of the so-called 
 ``executable counterparts'' of the functions defined in the book.  Then, 
 functions defined in the book will be run compiled when including the book, 
 even for functions whose <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s have not been verified, or are in 
 <span class="v">:program</span> mode and running in so-called ``safe mode'' (for example, during 
 expansion of macros).  The default behavior, value <span class="v">t</span> of <span class="v">compile-flg</span>, 
 is unchanged.  Moreover, a new <span class="v">:comp!</span> argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 now compiles the executable counterparts when creating the book's compiled 
 file, and unlike <span class="v">:comp</span>, always deletes the old compiled file first so 
 that one always gets a fresh compile.</p> 
 
 <p>Now, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> gives a "Guards" warning only for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode functions that are defined in the given book but have not had 
 their guards verified.  Previously, it also warned about such functions that 
 were defined in the certification world or in sub-books.</p> 
 
 <p>A new command, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REDO-FLAT.html">redo-flat</a></span>, facilitates the debugging of failed 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span> forms by evaluating preliminary forms in 
 order to leave one at the point of failure.  See <a href="ACL2____REDO-FLAT.html">redo-flat</a>.  Thanks to 
 Ray Richards and others for asking for such a utility, and to Sandip Ray for 
 useful discussions.</p> 
 
 <p>We have changed the automatic declaration of of function types (still done 
 in GCL and OpenMCL only, for now).  Our motivation was to avoid the assumption 
 that Common Lisp functions return one value when ACL2 says that they do; 
 thanks to Bob Boyer for bringing this issue to our attention with the example 
 of defining <span class="v">(foo x y)</span> to be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a> x y)</span>.  ACL2 was saying that 
 <span class="v">foo</span> returns a single value, but because <span class="v">floor</span> returns two values in 
 raw Lisp, so does <span class="v">foo</span>.  Other changes to automatic declaration include 
 comprehending <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUND.html">defund</a></span>, not just <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new function, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MOD-EXPT.html">mod-expt</a></span>, computes <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> base exp) m)</span>, 
 and does so efficiently in some implementations (currently only in GCL 2.7.0, 
 which is not yet released).  Thanks to Warren Hunt for suggesting such an 
 addition.</p> 
 
 <p>New functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GETENV_42.html">getenv$</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SETENV_42.html">setenv$</a></span> have been made available 
 for reading and writing environment variables.  Thanks to Jun Sawada for 
 requesting these utilities.</p> 
 
 <p>The query utility <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span> has been improved in several ways.  As 
 before, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> rules are only printed if the argument is a symbol; 
 but the information printed for them is now more appropriate.  The following 
 are changes for the case that the argument is not a symbol, but rather, a 
 term.  (1) Rules are displayed that have <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relations other 
 than <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>.  (2) All matching <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> rules are 
 displayed, where previously <span class="v">:definition</span> rules were only shown if they 
 were ``simple'' rules (sometimes known as ``abbreviations''); see <a href="ACL2____SIMPLE.html">simple</a>.  (3) The ``Equiv'' field is printed for terms, not just symbols.  (4) 
 The substitution is shown that, when applied to the left-hand side of the 
 rule, will yield the specified term.  Thanks to Eric Smith for suggesting 
 these changes.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command <span class="v">;show-rewrites</span> has been improved to 
 match the changes described above for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span>.  In particular, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> rules that are not ``<a href="ACL2____SIMPLE.html">simple</a>'' are now 
 displayed by the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>'s <span class="v">show-rewrites</span> (and <span class="v">sr</span>) 
 command, and the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>'s <span class="v">rewrite</span> command has been 
 correspondingly modified to accept these <span class="v">:definition</span> rules.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed `make' targets <span class="v">copy-distribution</span>, <span class="v">copy-workshops</span>, and 
 <span class="v">copy-nonstd</span> so that they should also work for non-developers.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was causing <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span> to display <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></span> 
 hypotheses oddly in some cases, in particular <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ...))</span>.  (The 
 problem was in the ``untranslate'' display of the internal form of 
 <span class="v">syntaxp</span> calls.)  Thanks to Robert Krug for bringing this problem to our 
 attention.  We also removed the restriction on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></span> that its 
 argument could not be a variable, a constant, or (more interestingly) a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span> application (i.e., a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> expression).</p>
