 <p>A <b>mechanical theorem prover</b> is a computer program that finds proofs 
 of theorems.</p> 
 
 <p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/automatic-theorem-prover.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <p>The ideal mechanical theorem prover is <b>automatic</b>: you give it a 
 formula and it gives you a proof of that formula or tells you there is no 
 proof.</p> 
 
 <p>Unfortunately, automatic theorem provers can be built only for very simple 
 logics (e.g., <b>propositional calculus</b>) and even then practical 
 considerations (e.g., how many centuries you are willing to wait) limit the 
 problems they can solve.</p>
