<p>ACL2 Version  8.1 (September, 2018) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we roughly organize the changes to ACL2 since Version 8.0 into the 
 following categories of changes: existing features, new features, heuristic 
 and efficiency improvements, bug fixes, changes at the system level, Emacs 
 support, and experimental versions.  Each change is described in just one 
 category, though of course many changes could be placed in more than one 
 category.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that only ACL2 system changes are listed below.  See also <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-1-BOOKS.html">note-8-1-books</a> for a summary of changes made to the ACL2 Community Books 
 since ACL2 8.0, including the build system.  Also note that with each release, 
 it is typical that the value of constant <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2ACL2-EXPORTS_A2.html">*ACL2-exports*</a></span> has been 
 extended, and that some built-in functions that were formerly in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode are now <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode 
 functions.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes to Existing Features</h3> 
 
 <p>The evaluation of <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> guards now allows attachments.  This is 
 important for the implementation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> (see below).</p> 
 
 <p>A new keyword argument for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span>, <span class="v">:constrain</span>, can specify 
 that the newly-introduced function is constrained rather than defined.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a>.  Note that by constraining the function we make it possible 
 to attach to it, and also to introduce it as a <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified function. 
 We also made a minor change to <span class="v">defun-sk</span>, by moving the call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXTEND-PE-TABLE.html">extend-pe-table</a></span> out of the generated <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form.</p> 
 
 <p>(Of interest only to users of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>.)  When invoking <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a></span>, a so-called `<a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a>' is introduced. 
 Warrants are now always <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified, with a guard of <span class="v">t</span>. 
 Moreover, warrants are now executable in the top-level loop; for example, 
 after successfully processing <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a> foo)</span> or <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> foo ...)</span>, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a> foo)</span> will evaluate to <span class="v">t</span> in the loop.  (Note: each warrant 
 has an attachment, <span class="v">true-apply$-warrant</span>, that always returns <span class="v">t</span>; see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>.)  Thanks to Dmitry Nadezhin for requesting these 
 enhancements.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now required to include the system book 
 <span class="v">projects/apply/apply-lemmas.lisp</span> before evaluating a call of <span class="v">defun$</span> 
 or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span>.  This requirement, which is enforced with an error 
 that prints the necessary <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form, avoids stack overflows 
 that could occur when that book is not included.</p> 
 
 <p>When performing <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> expansion under a surrounding <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> context, it is no longer illegal to set the <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>.  For example, the following event formerly caused an 
 error but is now legal.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> (<a href="ACL2____ER-PROGN.html">er-progn</a> (<a href="ACL2____SET-IGNORE-OK.html">set-ignore-ok</a> t)
                             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) x)
                             (<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> `(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> ,(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LENGTH.html">length</a> (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state)))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Information printed when giving <span class="v">:use</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> has been improved 
 for the case that a <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a> is a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMINATION-THEOREM.html">termination-theorem</a></span> or a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD-THEOREM.html">guard-theorem</a></span>.  Formerly, only the 
 name was shown in the `<span class="v">Hint-events</span>' <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> and in the proof 
 output; now, one will see ``names'' of the form <span class="v">(:termination-theorem
 NAME)</span> and <span class="v">(:guard-theorem NAME)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We improved redundancy checking for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> forms so that it is not 
 sensitive to whether <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> has a <span class="v">:stobjs</span> declaration.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> for weak <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules have been 
 eliminated.  These warnings were issued when a rule was insufficient to prove 
 itself by <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> reasoning, but it seems more appropriate to 
 parse the formula into a type-prescription rule before applying that check 
 (for example, expanding away <a href="ACL2____GUARD-HOLDERS.html">guard-holders</a>, which was already done, and 
 beta reducing lambda applications, which was not).  Then the chance of not 
 proving the result seems remote.  Thanks to Keshav Kini for an example and a 
 conversation leading to this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____CHECKSUM.html">checksum</a> computation that can support certifying or including 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> — which is not used by default, but see <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> 
 for how to enable it — has been improved.  Specifically, at least one of 
 the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> (namely, <span class="v">books/centaur/aignet/rwlib.lisp</span>) 
 formerly caused a stack overflow (with host Lisp SBCL, at least) before making 
 this change.  (Technical note: the change is to avoid memoization for calls of 
 <span class="v">fchecksum-obj</span> with stack depth exceeding 
 <span class="v">10000</span>.)  Thanks to Keshav Kini for reporting 
 this issue and for related helpful communications.</p> 
 
 <p>When a <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> command such as <span class="v">:eval</span> or <span class="v">:go</span> shows 
 that a rule fails because a <a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> is exceeded, more 
 information is printed than before.  Now, the responsible rule(s) or global 
 backchain-limit is indicated.  Thanks to Alessandro Coglio and Eric Smith for 
 requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>The fancy string reader now accepts a string with three string quotes 
 followed by a closing curly brace.  See <a href="ACL2____FANCY-STRING-READER.html">fancy-string-reader</a>, in 
 particular the final paragraph.  Thanks to Sol Swords for contributing this 
 enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNTRANSLATE.html">untranslate</a></span> function, which converts the internal 
 representation of <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>s to user-level syntax, can now return calls of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBT.html">mbt</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span>, and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>.  Thanks to Alessandro Coglio, Eric Smith, and Stephen Westfold 
 for discussions leading to some of these changes.  Such terms rarely occur in 
 practice because definitional bodies are stored with calls of <a href="ACL2____GUARD-HOLDERS.html">guard-holders</a> and <span class="v">cw</span> expanded.  However, here is an example of how they 
 could arise.  First consider the following definition.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (n)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :normalize nil))
  (<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> n)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Here is a log before the change.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">verify</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x) yyy))
-&gt;: 1
-&gt;: p
(<a href="ACL2____G.html">G</a> X)
-&gt;: x-dumb
-&gt;: p
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">LET</a> ((N X)) (EC-CALL1 NIL (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">NATP</a> N)))
-&gt;:</pre> 
 
 <p>After the change, the log instead ends as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">-&gt;: p
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">LET</a> ((N X)) (<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">EC-CALL</a> (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">NATP</a> N)))
-&gt;:</pre> 
 
 <p>It is now illegal by default to attach to built-in functions.  To overcome 
 this default behavior, see <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH-SYSTEM.html">defattach-system</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Improvements have been made to functions in the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span> family, 
 including for example <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT-TO-STRING.html">fmt-to-string</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span>. 
 (Also see discussion of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMX-CW.html">fmx-cw</a></span> under ``New Features,'' below.)</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Many <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s have been strengthened, for example to imply that the 
 <span class="v">alist</span> argument must satisfy <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CHARACTER-ALISTP.html">character-alistp</a></span>.  Thanks to Eric 
 Smith for pointing out that an expression like <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FMT-TO-STRING.html">fmt-to-string</a> "~x0" 3)</span> 
 could cause a raw Lisp error (rather than causing a guard violation).</li> 
 
 <li>Eliminated raw Lisp errors from ill-formed calls.  Thanks to Jared Davis 
 for pointing out this problem in 2010 (!) with the example <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> "Bad:
 ~&amp;0.~%" 5)</span>, and for Eric Smith for prodding us much more recently with the 
 example <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> "~&amp;0" 'x)</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a></span> no longer prints an initial newline.  Of course, a 
 call <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "&lt;some-string&gt;" ...)</span> can be modified to generate an initial 
 newline (thus providing the former behavior) by adding the newline 
 tilde-directive, <span class="v">"~%"</span>, that is, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FMX.html">fmx</a> "~%&lt;some-string&gt;"
 ...)</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The previously-undocumented built-in-function, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PACKN.html">packn</a></span>, now has a 
 slightly different behavior.  Formerly, it always returned a symbol in the 
 <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> package.  Now, the package of the symbol returned is the package 
 of the first symbol in <span class="v">lst</span> whose package is not <span class="v">"COMMON-LISP"</span> if 
 any, else <span class="v">"ACL2"</span>.  Thanks to Keshav Kini for suggesting this change and 
 providing its implementation.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> (also the guard on <span class="v">apply$-lambda</span>) 
 has been strengthened to require that a <a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> be applied to the 
 correct number of arguments.  The under-the-hood implementation for applying 
 lambdas has been made slightly more efficient as a result, though that 
 improvement may usually be trivial.  Perhaps more important is that guard 
 verification may now catch bugs in the application of lambdas that were missed 
 previously.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:dir</span> argument to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> was previously ignored when the first 
 argument of the call of <span class="v">ld</span> is not a string.  Now, that is an error.  If 
 you get this error, just remove the (previously ignored) <span class="v">:dir</span> 
 argument.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAGIC-EV-FNCALL.html">magic-ev-fncall</a></span> sometimes printed a message in the 
 error case in addition to returning that message.  It now only returns that 
 message.  Thanks to Sol Swords for bringing to our attention that 
 certification of a community book, 
 <span class="v">books/projects/x86isa/proofs/popcount/popcount.lisp</span>, was printing a 
 warning about <span class="v">"Meta-level function Problem"</span> for thousands of lines.</p> 
 
 <p>The definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MSGP.html">msgp</a></span> has been strengthened to require that for a 
 <span class="v">cons</span> pair, the <span class="v">cdr</span> must satisfy <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CHARACTER-ALISTP.html">character-alistp</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> command, <span class="v">quiet!</span>, now inhibits all output 
 except <span class="v">error</span> output (and that too, if already inhibited).</p> 
 
 <p>Warnings have been modified that are labeled ``[Non-rec]'', generated for 
 rules with problematic occurrences of non-recursive function symbols.  Now 
 they take into account rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>.  Thanks to 
 Mihir Mehta for bringing this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>It is no longer required to specify <span class="v">:install-body nil</span> in a <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> rule when the function symbol is a member of the value of the 
 constant <span class="v">*definition-minimal-theory*</span>.  Thanks to Eric Smith for pointing 
 out that the utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTALL-NOT-NORMALIZED.html">install-not-normalized</a></span>, was failing on, for 
 example, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>.  This change fixes that problem.  Technical note for 
 system hackers only: Because of this change, the value of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BODY.html">body</a> fn t
 wrld)</span> is no longer guaranteed to get the original definition of <span class="v">fn</span> when 
 fn is in <span class="v">*definition-minimal-theory*</span>; for that purpose use the new 
 utility, <span class="v">bbody</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Many error messages now show variables according to order of appearance, 
 where formerly the order was reversed.  Thanks to Eric Smith for supplying an 
 example of a top-level form, <span class="v">+ a b c</span>, for which the error message 
 reported variables in reverse order: ``Global variables, such as C, B and A, 
 are not allowed.''  The message now says ``A, B, and C'' instead of ``C, B and 
 A.''</p> 
 
 <p>For <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a></span>, the keyword argument <span class="v">:on-skip-proofs</span> 
 provides new behavior if it is given the value, <span class="v">:interactive</span>.  In that 
 case, evaluation is still done under a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span>, as when 
 the value of <span class="v">:on-skip-proofs</span> is <span class="v">t</span>; but evaluation is skipped when 
 the reason proofs are being skipped is only that a book is being included or 
 the second pass is being made through an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>.  Thanks to Eric 
 Smith for requesting this feature.</p> 
 
 <p>Both <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT-TO-COMMENT-WINDOW.html">fmt-to-comment-window</a></span> and <span class="v">fmt-to-comment-window!</span> have an 
 extra argument, <span class="v">print-base-radix</span>, which is the same as the first argument 
 to the new utilities, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW-PRINT-BASE-RADIX.html">cw-print-base-radix</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW-PRINT-BASE-RADIX_12.html">cw-print-base-radix!</a></span> (see below).</p> 
 
 <p>The undocumented constants <span class="v">*primitive-program-fns-with-raw-code*</span>, 
 <span class="v">*primitive-logic-fns-with-raw-code*</span>, and 
 <span class="v">*primitive-macros-with-raw-code*</span> have been renamed respectively to 
 <span class="v">*initial-program-fns-with-raw-code*</span>, 
 <span class="v">*initial-logic-fns-with-raw-code*</span>, and 
 <span class="v">*initial-macros-with-raw-code*</span>.  Thanks to Alessandro Coglio for 
 suggesting these improved names.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a></span> utility now utilizes a relative pathname in the 
 <span class="v">saved_acl2</span> script, which can allow it and a corresponding image file to 
 be moved, even across filesystems — though if there is an image file, 
 then probably the Lisp executable must have the same pathname even after the 
 move.  Thanks to Eric Smith for suggesting this capability and providing a 
 hint for how to implement it, to Sol Swords for pointing out a limitation of 
 the initial implementation, and to <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/40144/how-can-i-retrieve-the-absolute-filename-in-a-shell-script-on-mac-os-x" target="_blank"><nobr>this 
 website<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://serverfault.com/questions/40144/how-can-i-retrieve-the-absolute-filename-in-a-shell-script-on-mac-os-x"></nobr></a> for making that solution robust.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a></span> macro, and more generally the notion of evaluator, 
 have been changed to include two new <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s inserted after 
 constraints 0 through 5.  The new constraints are as follows, where <span class="v">&lt;ev&gt;</span> 
 refers to the evaluator.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">SYMBOLP</a> X)))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (&lt;ev&gt; X A) NIL))
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">SYMBOLP</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X))))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">EQUAL</a> (&lt;ev&gt; X A) NIL))</pre> 
 
 <p>These new constraints generated by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a></span> are named 
 <span class="v">&lt;ev&gt;-CONSTRAINT-6</span> and <span class="v">&lt;ev&gt;-CONSTRAINT-7</span> 
 unless the keyword argument <span class="v">:namedp t</span> is supplied, 
 in which case they are named <span class="v">&lt;ev&gt;-OF-NONSYMBOL-ATOM</span> and 
 <span class="v">&lt;ev&gt;-OF-BAD-FNCALL</span>.  Thus by default (or if 
 <span class="v">:namedp</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>), this change increases by one the indices on 
 constraints for the specified function symbols, because they start at 8 
 instead of 6 — <span class="v">&lt;ev&gt;-CONSTRAINT-8</span>, <span class="v">&lt;ev&gt;-CONSTRAINT-9</span>, and so 
 on.  Note that if you use functional instantiation to prove a theorem about 
 one evaluator given a theorem about another evaluator, you'll need to enable 
 the new rules (i.e., <span class="v">ev-constraint-6</span> and <span class="v">ev-constraint-7</span> 
 or, if you use option <span class="v">:namedp t</span>, 
 <span class="v">ev-of-nonsymbol-atom</span> and <span class="v">ev-of-bad-fncall</span>). 
 Thanks to Sol Swords for both suggesting and 
 implementing this extension.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">Let</a></span>-expressions are no longer eliminated from right-hand sides of 
 <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules.  See <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>.  This change improves efficiency of 
 the rewriter in some cases, by retaining subexpressions shared on the 
 right-hand side as the rewrite rule is applied.  Thanks to Eric Smith for 
 requesting this change.</p> 
 
 <p>It was possible to declare a function symbol to be <a href="ACL2____UNTOUCHABLE.html">untouchable</a> and 
 yet still execute it using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>, thus violating the spirit of 
 untouchables.  That is no longer allowed.  Here is an example of such 
 execution that was formerly permitted, but is no longer.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "projects/apply/apply-lemmas" :dir :system)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x))
(<a href="ACL2____PUSH-UNTOUCHABLE.html">push-untouchable</a> f t)
(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'f '(3))</pre> 
 
 <h3>New Features</h3> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> now shows, by default, the list of doublets <span class="v">(f g)</span> 
 for which <span class="v">f</span> is a system function with attachment <span class="v">g</span> (see <a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>), when <span class="v">g</span> differs from the initial attachment to <span class="v">f</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>(Warning: The following describes advanced features that can likely be 
 ignored by most users.  They are available using the new utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH-SYSTEM.html">defattach-system</a></span>.)  Three new system-level functions may be given 
 attachments: <span class="v">remove-trivial-equivalences-enabled-p</span>, 
 <span class="v">assume-true-false-aggressive-p</span>, and <span class="v">rewrite-if-avoid-swap</span>.  (Thanks 
 to Eric Smith for suggesting these, and to him and Alessandro Coglio for 
 helpful discussions.)  By default, these have the attachments 
 <span class="v">constant-t-function-arity-0</span>, <span class="v">constant-nil-function-arity-0</span>, and 
 <span class="v">constant-nil-function-arity-0</span>, respectively, which provide the existing 
 system behavior.  But these attachments may be changed by the user.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">Remove-trivial-equivalences-enabled-p</span> may receive the attachment 
 <span class="v">constant-nil-function-arity-0</span> to avoid the 
 <span class="v">remove-trivial-equivalences</span> heuristic, which substitutes the equality (or 
 even equivalence) of a variable to a term into the rest of the 
 goal.  (However, perhaps similar heuristics will still be used, for example as 
 part of the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>.)</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">Assume-true-false-aggressive-p</span> may receive the attachment 
 <span class="v">constant-t-function-arity-0</span> to strengthen the rewriter's use of the <a href="ACL2____TYPE-ALIST.html">type-alist</a> when diving into <span class="v">if</span> terms.  A common use is to rewrite what 
 amounts to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> test1 test2) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> test1 _ x) _)</span>; then the <a href="ACL2____TYPE-ALIST.html">type-alist</a> will note that <span class="v">test2</span> is true when rewriting <span class="v">x</span>.  This 
 change may slow down ACL2 considerably in some cases, and should rarely if 
 ever be necessary when calling the prover; but it can be useful in 
 applications that call the rewriter directly.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">Rewrite-if-avoid-swap</span> may receive the attachment 
 <span class="v">constant-t-function-arity-0</span> to cause the rewriter — specifically, 
 source function <span class="v">rewrite-if</span> — to avoid swapping true and false 
 branches of a call of <span class="v">IF</span>, which could formerly happen when the test is a 
 call of <span class="v">NOT</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>When the environment variable <span class="v">ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION_QUIET</span> is set and not 
 <span class="v">""</span>, there will generally be no output from ACL2 customization.  A 
 special value of <span class="v">"all"</span> for this variable will cause continued minimal 
 output after startup.  See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION.html">ACL2-customization</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>New utilities, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMX-CW.html">fmx-cw</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMX_12-CW.html">fmx!-cw</a></span>, are essentially the same 
 as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW_12.html">cw!</a></span> (respectively), except that <span class="v">fmx-cw</span> and 
 <span class="v">fmx!-cw</span> are well-<a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>ed, which can catch errors in the use of 
 tilde-directives.  Thanks to Eric Smith for requesting such a capability.  For 
 example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____FMX-CW.html">fmx-cw</a> "Hello ~s0." '(<a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>))


ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  Guard violation for FMX-CW-FN:
Illegal Fmt Syntax.  The tilde-s directive at position 6 of the string
below is illegal because its variable evaluated to (<a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">WORLD</a>), which is
not a symbol, a string, or a number.

"Hello ~s0."

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>New utilities, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW-PRINT-BASE-RADIX.html">cw-print-base-radix</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW-PRINT-BASE-RADIX_12.html">cw-print-base-radix!</a></span>, are like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW_12.html">cw!</a></span>, respectively, 
 except for an additional argument that specifies the print-base and, 
 optionally, the print-radix.  Thanks to Eric Smith for requesting <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW-PRINT-BASE-RADIX.html">cw-print-base-radix</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new event macro, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-IN-THEORY-REDUNDANT-OKP.html">set-in-theory-redundant-okp</a></span>, allows <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></span> events to be <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT.html">redundant</a>, which prevents <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUND.html">defund</a></span> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHMD.html">defthmd</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> from laying down <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a></span> markers (as 
 seen, for example, using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PBT.html">pbt</a></span>).  Thanks to Eric Smith for asking 
 for a way for <span class="v">in-theory</span> events to be redundant.</p> 
 
 <h3>Heuristic and Efficiency Improvements</h3> 
 
 <p>The implementation of <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>s has been tweaked to avoid an 
 efficiency problem.  In the old implementation, an update to the wormhole 
 status was avoided in the case of equal old and new status values.  That 
 update avoided some consing, but the equality test could be very slow; indeed, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PRINT-GV.html">print-gv</a></span> could be slow because of its use of wormholes.  The new 
 wormhole implementation — specifically, the new raw Lisp implementation 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a></span> — avoids that equality test, and also can avoid 
 consing by its use of destructive operations.  That fixes one reason 
 <span class="v">:print-gv</span> could be slow; a second change, made to the implementation of 
 <span class="v">:print-gv</span>, is to pass <span class="v">nil</span> as the wormhole-status (<span class="v">whs</span>) argument 
 of <span class="v">make-wormhole-status</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____MAKE-WORMHOLE-STATUS.html">make-wormhole-status</a> for a 
 discussion of how that use of <span class="v">nil</span> can avoid an expensive equality 
 test.  Thanks to Alessandro Coglio and Eric Smith for sending an example that 
 illustrated the problem.</p> 
 
 <p>The following improvements have been made for evaluating calls of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> ...) ...)</span>.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>An optimization had failed to be fully in place, causing such calls to run 
 slowly.  That optimization compiles and caches ``tame compliant'' lambdas: 
 lambda forms whose <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s are verified by the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a> and 
 that are <i>tame</i> (see <a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a>).  The optimization had been used in 
 the unadvertised use of ``The Rubric'' prior to the release of ACL2 Version 
 8.0.  Warnings about non-tame-compliant lambdas will now appear when 
 appropriate, as had been the case in Version  7.4.</li> 
 
 <li>The optimization above has been improved so that instead of three cache 
 lines, there is an efficient implementation using 1000 cache lines.  That is 
 probably many more than are needed, but the large size is harmless.  The 
 additional cache lines dramatically improve speed when more than three lambdas 
 are actively being applied; see <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> file 
 <span class="v">books/system/tests/apply-timings.lisp</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>ACL2 no longer causes an error when the cache is in an inconsistent 
 state; instead, the cache is suitably reset quietly.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Rewriting of calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> has been optimized in the cases that 
 the rewritten arguments are equal or at least one is a constant.  Thanks to 
 Eric Smith for pointing out an incompleteness in the rewriting of <span class="v">implies</span> 
 calls.</p> 
 
 <p>The algorithm has been tweaked for generating a <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> 
 rule to store for a given definition, so that the rule is sometimes stronger 
 than was previously the case.</p> 
 
 <h3>Bug Fixes</h3> 
 
 <p>There was a soundness bug in the automatic functional instantiation that 
 can be applied for a <span class="v">:termination-theorem</span> <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>.  Thanks 
 to Eric Smith for sending an example to illustrate this bug, for suggesting 
 its cause, and for permission to include that example in a comment in the ACL2 
 sources definition of the constant, <span class="v">*non-instantiable-primitives*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Bugs have been fixed in the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a> that caused unsoundness 
 (going all the way back through Version  6.0, released December, 2012).  The 
 problem was with conversion of a non-strict inequality with 0 to a strict 
 inequality when the quantity is known not to be 0; for example, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> x 0)</span> 
 was converted to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x 0)</span> when <span class="v">x</span> was known to be non-zero.  But of 
 course, this conversion is only valid when <span class="v">x</span> is known to be a number. 
 Thanks to Yan Peng for sending an example that illustrates the bug, which in 
 its essence was the ability of ACL2 to prove this formula, which for example 
 is false when <span class="v">x = t</span>: <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> x 0) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> x 0) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____E3.html">&gt;</a> x 0))</span>.  If you encounter 
 a failure in a proof that formerly succeeded, the fix might be to add a call 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-NUMBERP.html">ACL2-numberp</a></span> to the hypotheses of your theorem.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed two bugs in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>: we now <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a></span> the <a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> of <span class="v">good-bye-fn</span> to prevent quitting ACL2 entirely 
 during a proof, and we avoid the error ``ACL2 cannot ev the call of 
 non-executable function ANCESTORS-CHECK...'' by allowing attachments to be 
 used when checking table guards (as discussed above).  Thanks to Dmitry 
 Nadezhin for sending replayable examples that exhibited these bugs.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s for functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENABLED-RUNEP.html">enabled-runep</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENABLED-NUMEP.html">enabled-numep</a></span>, <span class="v">disabledp-fn</span>, and <span class="v">disabledp-fn-lst</span>, thus eliminating 
 bogus guard violations.  Thanks to Alessandro Coglio and Eric Smith for 
 sending an example that illustrated the bug for <span class="v">enabled-runep</span>.  Technical 
 note: this fix was made by replacing calls of <span class="v">bounded-nat-alistp</span> (which 
 is no longer defined) by calls of <span class="v">nat-alistp</span> (which is newly defined). 
 We also made a corresponding tweak to the definition of 
 <span class="v">enabled-numep</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Warnings labeled with ``Double-rewrite'' failed to take into account 
 patterned <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> rules.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to Mihir 
 Mehta for pointing out the problem with a helpful example.</p> 
 
 <p>It is now possible, once again, to <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a> rules of class 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>.  This capability has (accidentally) been unavailable 
 since Version 7.4.  Thanks to Dmitry Nadezhin for reporting the bug with a 
 helpful example.</p> 
 
 <p>It was possible for users to change the attachments to built-in functions 
 <span class="v">badge-userfn</span> and <span class="v">apply$-userfn</span>, which support the implementation of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>.  This is now prevented.</p> 
 
 <p>For <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEQUIV.html">defequiv</a></span>, a <span class="v">:doc</span> keyword argument was allegedly (in the 
 documentation) supported but caused an ugly error.  The <span class="v">:doc</span> keyword 
 argument is now fully eliminated.  Thanks to Eric Smith for pointing out this 
 issue.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSO.html">pso</a></span> and related utilities <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSO_12.html">pso!</a></span>, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSOF.html">psof</a></span>, and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSOG.html">psog</a></span>, to avoid printing some error 
 messages.  Thanks to Keshav Kini for sending us an example to bring this bug 
 to our attention.  Also tweaked these utilities to avoid accumulating later 
 event failure messages into the saved output for a previous proof attempt, and 
 to avoid some bogus output when invoked before the first proof attempt of the 
 session.</p> 
 
 <p>When an invocation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHMD.html">defthmd</a></span> resulted in a macroexpansion error, 
 the failure did not cause an error message to be printed.  This has been 
 fixed.  Related tweaks improve error reporting, including a clearer error 
 message when attempting to supply <span class="v">:rule-classes nil</span> with <span class="v">defthmd</span>. 
 Thanks to Keshav Kini for reporting these issues.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a></span> was provided the argument <span class="v">:skip-checks nil</span>, a 
 hard error was signaled.  This has been fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-MATCH.html">case-match</a></span> macro did not properly handle the <span class="v">!sym</span> 
 construct when the symbol, <span class="v">!sym</span>, is not in the <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> package. 
 This has been fixed.  Thanks to Alessandro Coglio for reporting this bug.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed handling of some guard violation error messages for built-in 
 functions.  For example, the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42-LAMBDA.html">apply$-lambda</a> 3 nil)</span> produces a guard 
 violation, but before this fix, the error message reported an implementation 
 error.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PUFF.html">puff</a></span> command to avoid certain errors involving 
 <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Redundancy notes could be seen during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> while loading 
 the compiled file for a book.  These notes (along with, perhaps, some other 
 output) have been eliminated.  Thanks to Eric Smith for pointing us to this 
 problem with a reproducible example.</p> 
 
 <p>We eliminated an obscure hard error mentioning the source function 
 <span class="v">assume-true-false-if</span>, which could occur in the middle of a proof.  Thanks 
 to Dave Greve for pointing out this problem by sending us an illustrative 
 example that we could run.</p> 
 
 <p>It was possible to get a raw Lisp error from ill-formed calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a></span> not intended for execution, for example, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) (<a href="ACL2____NON-EXEC.html">non-exec</a>
 (<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> x)))</span>.  This has been fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>Certain syntactic requirements are normally applied to function bodies but 
 not to theorems.  However, these were being applied under calls of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____FLET.html">flet</a></span>.  Consider the following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____FLET.html">flet</a> ((foo (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)))
   (foo (<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 1 (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> x x)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>This was rejected with an error: ``The expected number of return values for 
 (MV X X) is 1 but the actual number of return values is 2.''  This has been 
 fixed.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing this problem to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug has been fixed in the logical definition of the function, 
 <span class="v">read-file-into-string2</span>, which supports the macro, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____READ-FILE-INTO-STRING.html">read-file-into-string</a></span>.  Thanks to Keshav Kini for finding this bug and to 
 Mihir Mehta for a query leading to Keshav's investigation.</p> 
 
 <p>The previous release was supposed to include a new utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-SUMMARY-LIMIT.html">checkpoint-summary-limit</a></span>, but that was missing.  Thanks to Keshav Kini for 
 pointing this out (and supplying the expected implementation).</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in the guard for built-in function <span class="v">warning1-cw</span>, which 
 could be seen for example by evaluating the form <span class="v">(warning$-cw 'my-ctx
 "The :REWRITE rule ~x0 loops forever." 'foo)</span>.  Thanks to Keshav Kini for 
 bringing this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>The definitions of the macros <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGIOR.html">logior</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGXOR.html">logxor</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGEQV.html">logeqv</a></span> were such that when any of these was applied to a 
 single argument, the expansion was simply that argument.  For example, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a> (foo a))</span> expanded to <span class="v">(foo a)</span>.  These definitions failed to 
 reflect the fact that in Common Lisp, an error may be signaled if that single 
 argument does not evaluate to an integer.  For example, the following 
 definition was admitted: <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a>
 x))</span>; yet a raw Lisp error was signaled when attempting to evaluate <span class="v">(f
 'x)</span>, in ACL2 built on Allegro Common Lisp.  This bug has been fixed: now, 
 when any of these four macros is applied to a single argument, <span class="v">a</span>, the 
 expansion is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a> integer a)</span>.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing this bug 
 to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ARGS.html">args</a></span> to avoid hard ACL2 error when applied to <span class="v">IF</span> 
 and to provide a clearer error message for Common Lisp functions not in ACL2. 
 Thanks to Eric McCarthy for sending examples to point out these issues.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug has been fixed that could cause an error when processing a legal 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____FLET.html">flet</a></span> form, because the processing of a binding could interfere 
 inappropriately with the processing of a subsequent binding, as in the 
 following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) x)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____FLET.html">flet</a> ((f (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x))
       (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (x) (f x))) ; processed with bad binding of stobjs-out for f
  (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> 3))</pre> 
 
 <p>Fixed an error message saying that ``It is illegal for supporters of 
 DEFAXIOM events to receive attachments'' that failed during printing.  Thanks 
 to Nathan Guermond for sending an example to point out this bug.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes at the System Level</h3> 
 
 <p>Fixed the use of `<span class="v">&lt;a href='URL'&gt;...&lt;/a&gt;</span>' so that if <span class="v">URL</span> has the 
 ampersand character in it, all will be well for both the web-based manual and 
 text-based rendering (as when <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> is used at the terminal or 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a></span> is used) provided that character is written as <span class="v">&amp;amp;</span> in 
 the documentation string.  Previously, the web-based manual could fail to 
 display the page for <span class="v">&amp;</span> in the documentation string, while with <span class="v">&amp;amp;</span> 
 used, the web-based manual could display the page but the text-based rendering 
 showed <span class="v">&amp;amp;</span> instead of simply <span class="v">&amp;</span>.  Thanks to Cuong Chau for pointing 
 out that the topic <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a></span> was not being displayed in the 
 online manual (back when <span class="v">&amp;</span> was used in the URL in the documentation 
 string).</p> 
 
 <p>The "clean" target of "make" has been deprecated since ACL2 Version 
 7.4 (released in March, 2017). Its replacement is target "clean-lite"; or, 
 use target "clean-all" (or equivalently, "distclean") if you want a more 
 thorough cleaning.</p> 
 
 <p>(SBCL only) ACL2 has been updated so that it builds on recent SBCL 
 versions.  In particular, the build was broken for SBCL 1.4.7, as SBCL changed 
 the ``RDTSC'' timing capability used in <a href="ACL2____MEMOIZATION.html">memoization</a>.  Thanks to Keshav 
 Kini for help with this issue, which has been resolved in ACL2 source file 
 <span class="v">memoize-raw.lisp</span>, as explained in the comment there about 
 ``read-cycle-counter''.</p> 
 
 <p>(CCL only) Raw Lisp error messages now mention the caller.  Thanks to Eric 
 Smith for pointing out that this information wasn't being provided in the ACL2 
 loop even though it was being provided in raw Lisp.</p> 
 
 <h3>EMACS Support</h3> 
 
 <p>Removed setting of the buffer coding system from <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span>. 
 Thanks to Keshav Kini for suggesting this change.  This should avoid certain 
 modifications of ``unusual'' characters when saving a file.</p> 
 
 <h3>Experimental Versions</h3> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-LOCAL-STATE.html">with-local-state</a></span> no longer causes an error in ACL2(p) 
 with <a href="ACL2____PARALLEL-EXECUTION.html">parallel-execution</a> enabled.  Thus, neither do <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT-TO-STRING.html">fmt-to-string</a></span> and related utilities, which call <span class="v">with-local-state</span>.</p>
