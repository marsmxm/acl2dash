<p>Some Final Comments</p><p>None of the examples show the use of the variable <span class="v">WORLD</span>, which 
 is allowed in computed hints.  There are some (undocumented) ACL2 utilities 
 that might be useful in programming hints, but these utilities need access to 
 the ACL2 logical world (see <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>A very useful fact to know is that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE-ALIST.html">table-alist</a> name world)</span> returns an 
 alist representation of the current value of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span> named 
 <span class="v">name</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 source code is littered with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions 
 for manipulating world.  In our source code, the world is usually bound a 
 variable named <span class="v">wrld</span>; so searching our code for that name might be 
 helpful.</p> 
 
 <p>Using these utilities to look at the <span class="v">WORLD</span> one can, for example, 
 determine whether a symbol is defined recursively or not, get the body and 
 formals of a defined function, or fetch the statement of a given lemma. 
 Because these utilities are not yet documented, we do not expect users to 
 employ <span class="v">WORLD</span> in computed hints.  But experts might and it might lead to 
 the formulation of a more convenient language for computed hints.</p> 
 
 <p>None of our examples illustrated the 7 argument form of a computed hint, 
 <span class="v">(fn ID CLAUSE WORLD STABLE-UNDER-SIMPLIFICATIONP HIST PSPV CTX)</span>.  When 
 used, the variables <span class="v">HIST</span>, <span class="v">PSPV</span>, and <span class="v">CTX</span>, are bound to the 
 clause history, the package of ``special variables'' governing the clause, and 
 the ``error message context.''  These variables are commonly used throughout 
 our source code but are, unfortunately, undocumented.  Again, we expect a few 
 experts will find them useful in developing computed hints.</p> 
 
 <p>If you start using computed hints extensively, please contact the 
 developers of ACL2 and let us know what you are doing with them and how we can 
 help.</p>
