<p>ACL2 Version 1.7 (released October 1994) Notes</p><p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">Include-book</a></span> now takes (optionally) an additional keyword 
 argument, indicating whether a compiled file is to be loaded.  The default 
 behavior is unchanged, except that a warning is printed when a compiled file 
 is not loaded.  See <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A markup language for <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> strings has been 
 implemented, and many of the source files have been marked up using this 
 language (thanks largely to the efforts of Laura Lawless).  See markup. 
 Moreover, there are translators that we have used to provide versions of the 
 ACL2 <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> in info (for use in emacs), html (for Mosaic), and 
 tex (for hardcopy) formats.</p> 
 
 <p>A new event <span class="v">defdoc</span> has been implemented.  It is like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFLABEL.html">deflabel</a></span>, 
 but allows redefinition of <a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a> strings and has other advantages.  See 
 <span class="v">defdoc</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We used to ignore corollaries when collecting up the axioms introduced 
 about constrained functions.  That bug has been fixed.  We thank John Cowles 
 for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a></span> now allows a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> keyword argument, 
 so that <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> may be attached to the name being introduced.</p> 
 
 <p>A new command <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NQTHM-TO-ACL2.html">nqthm-to-ACL2</a></span> has been added to help Nqthm users to 
 make the transition to ACL2.  See <a href="ACL2____NQTHM-TO-ACL2.html">nqthm-to-ACL2</a>, which also includes a 
 complete listing of the relevant tables.</p> 
 
 <p>Many function names, especially of the form ``foo<span class="v">-lst</span>'', have been 
 changed in order to support the following convention, for any ``foo'':</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(foo-listp lst)</span> represents the notion <span class="v">(for x in lst always foop
 x)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A complete list of these changes may be found at the end of this note.  All 
 of them except <span class="v">symbolp-listp</span> and <span class="v">list-of-symbolp-listp</span> have the 
 string ``<span class="v">-lst</span>'' in their names.  Note also that <span class="v">keyword-listp</span> has 
 been renamed <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-VALUE-LISTP.html">keyword-value-listp</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Accumulated persistence has been implemented.  It is not connected to 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a></span> or rule monitoring.  See <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Trigger-terms</span> has been added for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rule classes, 
 so you can hang a <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> rule under any addend you want.  See <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, which has been improved and expanded.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 now accepts <span class="v">256</span> <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> and includes the Common Lisp 
 functions <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR-CODE.html">char-code</a></span>.  However, ACL2 controls the 
 lisp reader so that <span class="v">#\c</span> may only be used when <span class="v">c</span> is a single 
 standard character or one of <span class="v">Newline</span>, <span class="v">Space</span>, <span class="v">Page</span>, <span class="v">Rubout</span>, 
 <span class="v">Tab</span>.  If you want to enter other <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> use <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a></span>, 
 e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____COERCE.html">coerce</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a> 7) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CODE-CHAR.html">code-char</a> 240) #a) 'string)</span>.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a>.  Note: our current handling of <a href="ACL2____CHARACTERS.html">characters</a> makes the 
 set of theorems different under Macintosh Common Lisp (MCL) than under other 
 Common Lisps.  We hope to rectify this situation before the final release of 
 ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a></span>, has been implemented, that 
 associates macro names with function names.  So for example, since <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a></span> is associated with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BINARY-APPEND.html">binary-append</a></span>, the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>
 append)</span> it is interpreted as though it were <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> binary-append)</span>. 
 See <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>, see <a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a> and see <a href="ACL2____REMOVE-MACRO-ALIAS.html">remove-macro-alias</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The implementation of conditional metalemmas has been modified so that the 
 metafunction is applied before the hypothesis metafunction is applied.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The Common Lisp functions <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ACONS.html">acons</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a></span> have been defined 
 in the ACL2 logic.</p> 
 
 <p>We have added the symbol <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> to the list <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>, 
 and hence to the package <span class="v">"ACL2-USER"</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A new hint, <span class="v">:restrict</span>, has been implemented.  See <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>It used to be that if <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a></span> were given a number that is greater 
 than the largest current <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> number, it treated that number the 
 same as <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MAX.html">max</a></span>.  Now, an error is caused.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> <span class="v">:force-table</span> has been eliminated.</p> 
 
 <p>A command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISABLEDP.html">disabledp</a></span> (and macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DISABLEDP.html">disabledp</a></span>) has been 
 added; see <a href="ACL2____DISABLEDP.html">disabledp</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">Compilation</a> via <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-COMPILE-FNS.html">set-compile-fns</a></span> is now suppressed 
 during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  In fact, whenever the <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global 
 variable <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> has value <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here are some less important changes, additions, and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>Unlike previous releases, we have not proved all the theorems in 
 <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span>; instead we have simply assumed them.  We have deferred such 
 proofs because we anticipate a fairly major changed in Version 1.8 in how we 
 deal with <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s.</p> 
 
 <p>We used to (accidentally) prohibit the ``redefinition'' of a <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> 
 as a function.  That is no longer the case.</p> 
 
 <p>The check for whether a <a href="ACL2____COROLLARY.html">corollary</a> follows tautologically has been 
 sped up, at the cost of making the check less ``smart'' in the following 
 sense: no longer do we expand primitive functions such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span> 
 before checking this propositional implication.</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT_12.html">ubt!</a></span> has been modified so that it never causes 
 or reports an error.  See <a href="ACL2____UBT_12.html">ubt!</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 now works in Harlequin LispWorks.</p> 
 
 <p>The user can now specify the <span class="v">:trigger-terms</span> for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> 
 rules.  See <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The name of the system is now ``ACL2''; no longer is it ``Acl2''.</p> 
 
 <p>The raw lisp counterpart of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THEORY-INVARIANT.html">theory-invariant</a></span> is now defined to be a 
 no-op as is consistent with the idea that it is just a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug was fixed that caused <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> <a href="ACL2____INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a> to be 
 executed when <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> was <span class="v">t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____RASSOC.html">rassoc</a></span> has been added, along with a corresponding 
 function used in its <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>, <span class="v">r-eqlable-alistp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a></span> event and hint now print a warning not only when 
 certain ``primitive'' <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> rules are <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d, but 
 also when certain ``primitive'' <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span> rules are 
 <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d.</p> 
 
 <p>The modified version of <span class="v">trace</span> provided by ACL2, for use in raw Lisp, 
 has been modified so that the lisp special variable <span class="v">*trace-alist*</span> is 
 consulted.  This alist associates, using <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>, values with their print 
 representations.  For example, initially <span class="v">*trace-alist*</span> is a one-element 
 list containing the pair <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> state '|*the-live-state*|)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The system now prints an observation when a form is skipped because the 
 default color is <span class="v">:red</span> or <span class="v">:pink</span>.  (Technically: <span class="v">when-cool</span> has 
 been modified.)</p> 
 
 <p>Additional protection exists when you submit a form to raw Common Lisp that 
 should only be submitted inside the ACL2 read-eval-print loop.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is a complete list of the changes in function names described near the 
 top of this note, roughly of the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">foo-lst --&gt; foo-listp</pre> 
 
 <p>meaning: the name ``<span class="v">foo-lst</span>'' has been changed to 
 ``<span class="v">foo-listp</span>.''</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">symbolp-listp    --&gt; symbol-listp
list-of-symbolp-listp  --&gt; symbol-list-listp
                       {for consistency with change to symbol-listp}
rational-lst     --&gt; rational-listp
                     {which in fact was already defined as well}

            {by analogy with the preceding, even though it's a
             ``some'' instead of ``all'' predicate]
