<p>How ACL2 selects induction schemes</p><p>This topic is for those curious about induction heuristics in ACL2. 
 It is not necessary to understand those heuristics to be able to use ACL2 
 successfully.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2's heuristics for generating an induction scheme for a conjecture are 
 very similar to Nqthm's and can trace their roots all the way back to the 
 Edinburgh Pure Lisp Theorem Prover, the first prover to support induction in a 
 general setting.</p> 
 
 <p>For a detailed description of how ACL2 generates induction schemes see <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-induction-heuristics.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>``ACL2 
 Induction Heuristics.''<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/publications/acl2-induction-heuristics.pdf"></nobr></a> That paper is intended for a general audience 
 familiar with induction but not necessarily familiar with theorem provers or 
 ACL2.  However, it can also serve as a guided tour through that part of the 
 ACL2 source code that creates and selects induction schemes.</p>
