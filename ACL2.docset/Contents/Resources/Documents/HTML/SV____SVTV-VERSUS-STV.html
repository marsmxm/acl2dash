<p>A note on naming conventions</p> 
 
<p>Svex STVs are modeled after <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> <a href="ACL2____SYMBOLIC-TEST-VECTORS.html">ACL2::symbolic-test-vectors</a>, and since they are intended to be a nearly 
drop-in replacement, we had to mangle the names of existing esim STV-related 
functions somehow.  We settled on the following scheme:</p> 
 
<p>Basically all Esim STV-related functions/utilities have names in the ACL2 
package and containing "STV".  So for an Esim function 
<span class="v">acl2::some-stv-tool</span>, we name our Svex analogue <span class="v">acl2::some-svtv-tool</span> 
and import that symbol into the SVEX package.  We also add an alias 
<span class="v">sv::some-stv-tool</span> (not in the ACL2 package).  To summarize, you can 
refer to the Svex version of this function by any of the following:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li><span class="v">acl2::some-svtv-tool</span></li> 
<li>
<span class="v">sv::some-svtv-tool</span>, really the same symbol as above</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">sv::some-stv-tool</span>, a macro alias for the above.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The modified name "SVTV" doesn't really stand for anything aside from 
perhaps "Svex symbolic test vector." In svex-related documentation, we refer 
to STVs and SVTVs more or less interchangeably, unless we are explicitly 
referring to Esim STVs (in which case we won't say SVTV).  We usually refer to 
functions using the SVTV versions of the name, since that will be the same in 
either package.</p> 
 
<p>Maybe we shouldn't pollute the ACL2 package with the SVTV symbols, and 
instead just use STV symbols in the SVEX package.  We don't have much of an 
excuse other than sometimes we're working in the ACL2 package and want to just 
type an extra V rather than an extra <span class="v">SV::</span>.</p>
