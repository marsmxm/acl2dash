<p>Reset the prehistory</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a>)     ; restart command numbering at 0
(<a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a> nil) ; same as above
(<a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a> t)   ; as above except also disable ubt-prehistory

General Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a>)
(<a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a> permanent-p)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">permanent-p</span> is <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>.  After execution of this 
 command, ACL2 will change the numbering provided by its <a href="ACL2____HISTORY.html">history</a> 
 utilities so that this <span class="v">reset-prehistory</span> command (or the top-level 
 compound <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> containing it, which for example might be an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>) is assigned the number 0.  The only way to undo this command is 
 with command <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBT-PREHISTORY.html">ubt-prehistory</a></span>.  However, even that is disallowed if 
 <span class="v">permanent-p</span> is <span class="v">t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the second argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, which specifies the 
 number of commands in the certification world (i.e., since ground-zero), is 
 not sensitive to <span class="v">reset-prehistory</span>; rather, it expects the number of 
 commands since ground-zero.  To see such commands, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PBT.html">pbt</a></span><span class="v">
 :start</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">reset-prehistory</span> event for which parameter <span class="v">permanent-p</span> has the 
 default value of <span class="v">nil</span> is always skipped when any of the following 
 conditions holds: during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>; during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> or 
 the second pass of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> (indeed, whenever <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a> special 
 <span class="tt">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> has value <span class="v">'include-book</span>); or when 
 <span class="v">state</span> global <span class="v">'skip-reset-prehistory</span> has a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value.  Thus, 
 we avoid resetting the history numbering to 0 when including or certifying a 
 book, since that would probably not be what was intended.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____UBT-PREHISTORY.html">ubt-prehistory</a> for how to undo a <span class="v">reset-prehistory</span> command 
 that does not have a <span class="v">permanent-p</span> of <span class="v">t</span>.</p>
