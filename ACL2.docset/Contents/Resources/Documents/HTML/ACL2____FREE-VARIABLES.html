<p>Free variables in rules</p><p>As described elsewhere (see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>), ACL2 rules are 
 treated as implications for which there are zero or more hypotheses <span class="v">hj</span> to 
 prove.  In particular, rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> may look like 
 this:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> h1 ... hn)
         (fn lhs rhs))</pre> 
 
 <p>Variables of <span class="v">hi</span> are said to occur <i>free</i> in the above 
 <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule if they do not occur in <span class="v">lhs</span> or in any <span class="v">hj</span> with 
 <span class="v">j&lt;i</span>.  (To be precise, here we are only discussing those variables that 
 are not in the scope of a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>/<span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>/<span class="v">lambda</span> that binds 
 them.)  We also refer to these as the <i>free variables</i> of the rule.  ACL2 
 may issue a warning or error when there are free variables in a rule, as 
 described below.  (Variables of <span class="v">rhs</span> may be considered free if they do not 
 occur in <span class="v">lhs</span> or in any <span class="v">hj</span>.  But we do not consider those in this 
 discussion.)</p> 
 
 <p>In general, the <i>free variables</i> of rules are those variables 
 occurring in their hypotheses (not <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>/<span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>/<span class="v">lambda</span>-bound) 
 that are not bound when the rule is applied.  For rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span>, variables are bound by a trigger 
 term.  (See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a discussion of the <span class="v">:trigger-terms</span> 
 field).  For rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span>, variables are 
 bound by the <span class="v">:typed-term</span> field.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES-EXAMPLES.html">free-variables-examples</a> for more examples of how this all works, 
 including illustration of how the user can exercise some control over it.  In 
 particular, see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES-EXAMPLES-REWRITE.html">free-variables-examples-rewrite</a> for an explanation of 
 output from the <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> facility in the presence of rewriting 
 failures involving free variables, as well as an example exploring ``binding 
 hypotheses'' as described below.</p> 
 
 <p>Let us discuss the method for relieving hypotheses of <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules 
 with free variables.  Similar considerations apply to <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a> and <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rules, and <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules.  Note that the 
 <span class="v">:match-free</span> mechanism discussed below does not apply to <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules.  See <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES-TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">free-variables-type-prescription</a> for a 
 discussion of how to control free-variable matching for <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules.</p> 
 
 <p>We begin with an example.  Does the proof of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span> below 
 succeed?</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p2 (x y) t)

(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> p2-trans
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p2 x y)
                (p2 y z))
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (p2 x z) t))
  :rule-classes ((:rewrite :match-free :all)))

(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p2 a c)
                   (p2 a b)
                   (p2 c d))
              (p2 a d)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Consider what happens when the proof of the <span class="v">thm</span> is attempted.  The 
 ACL2 rewriter attempts to apply rule <span class="v">p2-trans</span> to the conclusion, <span class="v">(p2 a
 d)</span>.  So, it binds variables <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">z</span> from the left-hand side of the 
 conclusion of <span class="v">p2-trans</span> to terms <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">d</span>, respectively, and then 
 attempts to relieve the hypotheses of <span class="v">p2-trans</span>.  The first hypothesis of 
 <span class="v">p2-trans</span>, <span class="v">(p2 x y)</span>, is considered first.  Variable <span class="v">y</span> is free in 
 that hypothesis, i.e., it has not yet been bound.  Since <span class="v">x</span> is bound to 
 <span class="v">a</span>, the rewriter looks through the context for a binding of <span class="v">y</span> such 
 that <span class="v">(p2 a y)</span> is true, and it so happens that it first finds the term 
 <span class="v">(p2 a b)</span>, thus binding <span class="v">y</span> to <span class="v">b</span>.  Now it goes on to the next 
 hypothesis, <span class="v">(p2 y z)</span>.  At this point <span class="v">y</span> and <span class="v">z</span> have already been 
 bound to <span class="v">b</span> and <span class="v">d</span>; but <span class="v">(p2 b d)</span> cannot be proved.</p> 
 
 <p>So, in order for the proof of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span> to succeed, the rewriter 
 needs to backtrack and look for another way to instantiate the first 
 hypothesis of <span class="v">p2-trans</span>.  Because <span class="v">:match-free :all</span> has been 
 specified, backtracking does take place.  This time <span class="v">y</span> is bound to <span class="v">c</span>, 
 and the subsequent instantiated hypothesis becomes <span class="v">(p2 c d)</span>, which is 
 true.  The application of rule <span class="v">(p2-trans)</span> succeeds and the theorem is 
 proved.</p> 
 
 <p>If instead <span class="v">:match-free :all</span> had been replaced by <span class="v">:match-free
 :once</span> in rule <span class="v">p2-trans</span>, then backtracking would not occur, and the 
 proof of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span> would fail.</p> 
 
 <p>Next we describe in detail the steps used by the rewriter in dealing with 
 free variables.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 rewriter uses the following sequence of steps to relieve a 
 hypothesis with free variables, except that steps (1) and (3) are skipped for 
 <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> rules and step (3) is skipped for 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> rules.  First, if the hypothesis is of the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> hyp0)</span> or <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a> hyp0)</span>, then replace it with 
 <span class="v">hyp0</span>.</p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p>(1) Suppose the hypothesis has the form <span class="v">(equiv var term)</span> 
 where <span class="v">var</span> is free and no variable of <span class="v">term</span> is free, and either 
 <span class="v">equiv</span> is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> or else <span class="v">equiv</span> is a known <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> 
 relation and <span class="v">term</span> is a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a></span>.  We call this a 
 ``binding hypothesis.''  Then bind <span class="v">var</span> to the result of rewriting 
 <span class="v">term</span> in the current context.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) Look for a binding of the free variables of the hypothesis so that the 
 corresponding instance of the hypothesis is known to be true in the current 
 context.</p> 
 
 <p>(3) Search all <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a></span>d, hypothesis-free rewrite rules of the form 
 <span class="v">(equiv lhs rhs)</span>, where <span class="v">lhs</span> has no variables (other than those bound 
 by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>, or <span class="v">lambda</span>), <span class="v">rhs</span> is known to be true in 
 the current context, and <span class="v">equiv</span> is typically <span class="v">equal</span> but can be any 
 equivalence relation appropriate for the current context (see <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a>); then attempt to bind the free variables so that the instantiated 
 hypothesis is <span class="v">lhs</span>.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>For cases (2) and (3), the first instance found may ultimately fail because 
 the remaining hypotheses are not all relieved under the extended bindings.  In 
 that case, should the attempt to relieve hypotheses fail, or should the search 
 continue to find other instances for (2) or (3)?  The answer depends on which 
 of two options is in force for the so-called ``match-free'' of the rule. 
 Below we discuss how to specify these two options as ``<span class="v">:once</span>'' or 
 ``<span class="v">:all</span>'' (the default), respectively.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose that the original hypothesis is a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a></span>, where forcing is enabled (see <a href="ACL2____ENABLE-FORCING.html">enable-forcing</a>) .  Also 
 suppose that one of the following two cases applies: no instances are found for 
 (2) and also none for (3), or else the ``match-free'' option for the rule is 
 <span class="v">:all</span> (as discussed below) and all attempts ultimately fail for (2) 
 and (3) (because the remaining hypotheses are not all relieved).  Then the 
 current hypothesis is relieved but in the resulting split-off goals, all free 
 variables are bound to unusual names that call attention to this odd 
 situation.</p> 
 
 <p>Is it better to specify <span class="v">:once</span> or <span class="v">:all</span>?  We believe that <span class="v">:all</span> 
 is generally the better choice because of its greater power, provided the user 
 does not introduce a large number of rules with free variables, which has been 
 known to slow down the prover due to combinatorial explosion in the search 
 (Steps (2) and (3) above).</p> 
 
 <p>Either way, it is good practice to put the ``more substantial'' hypotheses 
 first, so that the most likely bindings of free variables will be found first 
 (in the case of <span class="v">:all</span>) or found at all (in the case of <span class="v">:once</span>).  For 
 example, a rewrite rule like</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p1 x y)
              (p2 x y))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (bar x) (bar-prime x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>may never succeed if <span class="v">p1</span> is nonrecursive and enabled, since we may well 
 not find calls of <span class="v">p1</span> in the current context.  If however <span class="v">p2</span> is 
 disabled or recursive, then the above rule may apply if the two hypotheses are 
 switched.  For in that case, we can hope for a match of <span class="v">(p2 x y)</span> in the 
 current context that therefore binds <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span>; then the rewriter's 
 full power may be brought to bear to prove <span class="v">(p1 x y)</span> for that <span class="v">x</span> and 
 <span class="v">y</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Moreover, the ordering of hypotheses can affect the efficiency of the 
 rewriter.  For example, the rule</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> y)
              (foo x y))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (bar x) (bar-prime x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>may well be sub-optimal.  Presumably the intention is to rewrite <span class="v">(bar
 x)</span> to <span class="v">(bar-prime x)</span> in a context where <span class="v">(foo x y)</span> is explicitly 
 known to be true for some rational number <span class="v">y</span>.  But <span class="v">y</span> will be bound 
 first to the first term found in the current context that is known to 
 represent a rational number.  If the 100th such <span class="v">y</span> that is found is the 
 first one for which <span class="v">(foo x y)</span> is known to be true, then wasted work will 
 have been done on behalf of the first 99 such terms <span class="v">y</span>  unless 
 <span class="v">:once</span> has been specified, in which case the rule will simply fail after 
 the first binding of <span class="v">y</span> for which <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> y)</span> is known to be true. 
 Thus, a better form of the above rule is almost certainly the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (foo x y)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> y))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (bar x) (bar-prime x)))</pre> 
 
 <p><i>Specifying `once' or `all'.</i></p> 
 
 <p>As noted above, the following discussion applies only to <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a>, 
 <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>, and <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> rules.  See <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES-TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">free-variables-type-prescription</a> for a discussion of analogous considerations 
 for <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules.</p> 
 
 <p>One method for specifying <span class="v">:once</span> or <span class="v">:all</span> for free-variable 
 matching is to provide the <span class="v">:match-free</span> field of the <span class="v">:rule-classes</span> of 
 the rule, for example, <span class="v">(:rewrite :match-free :all)</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.  However, there are global events that can be used to specify 
 <span class="v">:once</span> or <span class="v">:all</span>; see <a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-DEFAULT.html">set-match-free-default</a> and see <a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a>.  Here are some examples.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-MATCH-FREE-DEFAULT.html">set-match-free-default</a> :once)    ; future rules without a :match-free field
                                  ; are stored as :match-free :once (but this
                                  ; behavior is local to a book)
(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> :once t) ; existing rules are treated as
                                  ; :match-free :once regardless of their
                                  ; original :match-free fields
(<a href="ACL2____ADD-MATCH-FREE-OVERRIDE.html">add-match-free-override</a> :once (:rewrite foo) (:rewrite bar . 2))
                                  ; the two indicated rules are treated as
                                  ; :match-free :once regardless of their
                                  ; original :match-free fields</pre> 
 
 <p><i>Some history.</i> Before Version 2.7 the ACL2 rewriter performed Step 
 (2) above first.  More significantly, it always acted as though <span class="v">:once</span> had 
 been specified.  That is, if Step (2) did not apply, then the rewriter took 
 the first binding it found using either Steps (1) or (3), in that order, and 
 proceeded to relieve the remaining hypotheses without trying any other 
 bindings of the free variables of that hypothesis.</p>
