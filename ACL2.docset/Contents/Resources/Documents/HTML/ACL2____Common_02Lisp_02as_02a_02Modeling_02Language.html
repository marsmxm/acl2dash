<p>Common Lisp as a Modeling Language</p><p>In ACL2 we have adopted Common Lisp as the basis of our modeling language. 
 If you have already read our brief note on Common Lisp and recall the example 
 of <span class="v">app</span>, please proceed.  Otherwise click <a href="ACL2____Common_02Lisp.html">here</a> for an exceedingly brief introduction to Common 
 Lisp and then come <b>back</b> here.</p> 
 
 <p>In Common Lisp it is very easy to write systems of formulas that manipulate 
 discrete, inductively constructed data objects.  In building a model you might 
 need to formalize the notion of sequences and define such operations as 
 concatenation, length, whether one is a permutation of the other, etc.  It is 
 easy to do this in Common Lisp.  Furthermore, if you have a Common Lisp 
 ``theory of sequences'' you can <b>run</b> the operations and relations you 
 define.  That is, you can execute the functions on concrete data to see what 
 results your formulas produce.</p> 
 
 <p>If you define the function <span class="v">app</span> as shown above and then type</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(app '(A B) '(C D E))</pre> 
 
 <p>in any Common Lisp, the answer will be computed and will be <span class="v">(A B C D
 E)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <b>executable</b> nature of Common Lisp and thus of ACL2 is very handy 
 when producing models.</p> 
 
 <p>But executability is not enough for a modeling language because the purpose 
 of models is to permit analysis.</p>
