<p>Save an executable image and a wrapper script</p><p><span class="v">Save-exec</span> saves your ACL2 state so that you can immediately 
 re-start later in that same state.  This utility can be useful for a project 
 with <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> to be included every time ACL2 is started (see 
 <a href="BUILD____USING-EXTENDED-ACL2-IMAGES.html">build::using-extended-ACL2-images</a>), to avoid time 
 taken to run <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  Another use of <span class="v">save-exec</span> is to save 
 an executable that takes command-line arguments beyond those normally passed 
 to the host Lisp executable.  All arguments of a call of <span class="v">save-exec</span> are 
 evaluated.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Examples:

; Save an executable script named my-saved_acl2, with the indicated message
; added below the words "MODIFICATION NOTICE" under the start-up banner:
(<a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> "my-saved_acl2"
           "This saved image includes Version 7 of Project Foo.")

; Same as above, but instead with a generic comment under the modification
; notice:
(<a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> "my-saved_acl2" nil)

; Arrange that the generated script passes the indicated arguments to be
; processed by the Lisp (<a href="ACL2____ACL2.html">ACL2</a>) executable (where this example is specific to
; the case that CCL is the host Lisp):
(<a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> "my-saved_acl2" nil
           :host-lisp-args "--no-init -Z 256M")

; Arrange that the generated script passes along the indicated arguments
; to Lisp (<a href="ACL2____ACL2.html">ACL2</a>), but that they are not processed by Lisp other than to
; record the additional arguments (see (6) below).
(<a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> "my-saved_acl2" nil
           :inert-args "abc xyz -i foo")

; Combining the preceding two examples:
(<a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> "my-saved_acl2" nil
           :host-lisp-args "--no-init -Z 256M"
           :inert-args "abc xyz -i foo")

; Arrange that ACL2 evaluates (with LD) the three forms shown.
; In this example, the THM form fails, but that does not stop the definition
; of BAR from being evaluated: LD continues on, just as the top-level loop
; lets you continue after a failure.

             (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> bar (x) x)))

 <p>Each example above generates a file named "my-saved_acl2".  That file is 
 quite similar in form to the script generated when building ACL2 directly from 
 source code; details are below.  For example, here are the contents of that 
 generated file if the host Lisp is CCL (but where dates and pathnames are 
 specific to one's environment).  Here, we break lines using `\', but the 
 <span class="v">exec</span> command is actually on a single line.</p>

 <p>where the keyword arguments are optional, and arguments are as follows.</p> 
 
 <blockquote>
<p><span class="v">Exec-filename</span> is the filename of the proposed 
 executable.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Extra-startup-string</span> is a non-empty string to be printed after the 
 normal ACL2 startup message when you start up the saved image.  However, 
 <span class="v">extra-startup-string</span> is allowed to be <span class="v">nil</span>, in which case a generic 
 string will be printed instead.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Host-lisp-args</span> can be <span class="v">nil</span> (the default), but if it is a 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> value, then it is a string to be inserted into the command line 
 in the saved script, specifying additional arguments that are to be processed 
 by the host Lisp executable.  (Note for SBCL only: these are runtime options; 
 for toplevel options, see (8) below.)</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Inert-args</span> can be <span class="v">nil</span> (the default), but if it is a non-<span class="v">nil</span> 
 value, then it is a string to be inserted into the command line in the saved 
 script, specifying additional arguments that are not to be processed by the 
 host Lisp executable.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Return-from-lp</span> and <span class="v">init-forms</span> are <span class="v">nil</span> by default. 
 Regardless of their value, ACL2 starts up and enters its read-eval-print loop 
 in the usual way; see <a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a>.  Normally you'll stay inside that loop, but 
 if <span class="v">return-from-lp</span> or <span class="v">init-forms</span> is not <span class="v">nil</span>, then the indicated 
 forms are evaluated in the ACL2 read-eval-print loop: a single form in the 
 case of <span class="v">return-from-lp</span>, and a list of forms in the case of 
 <span class="v">init-forms</span>.  (Essentially, the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> special <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a></span> is 
 provided to a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> as a list with the indicated forms on the 
 front.)  Moreover, if the case of <span class="v">return-from-lp</span>, the loop is exited 
 after evaluation of the form, leaving you in raw Lisp.  Evaluation of 
 <span class="v">return-from-lp</span> is done with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> options that minimize output (also 
 see <a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a> to minimize output).  Suggestion: let 
 <span class="v">return-from-lp</span> be <span class="v">t</span> if you simply want to exit the read-eval-print 
 loop at startup, without evaluating any (nontrivial) form.</p> 
 
 <p>NOTE: It is illegal to supply non-<span class="v">nil</span> values for both 
 <span class="v">:return-from-lp</span> and <span class="v">:init-forms</span>.  But if you add <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> :q)</span> to 
 the end of your list of <span class="v">:init-forms</span>, and your other forms do not result 
 in an error, then you will be left in raw Lisp (as was presumably intended if 
 you were planning to use <span class="v">:return-from-lp</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>The remainder of this documentation focuses on the options other than 
 <span class="v">return-from-lp</span> and <span class="v">init-forms</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Details</b>:</p> 
 
 <p>(1) You must first exit the ACL2 read-eval-print loop, typically by 
 executing <span class="v">:q</span>, before evaluating a <span class="v">save-exec</span> call; otherwise an error 
 occurs.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) The image will be saved so that in the new image, the raw Lisp package 
 and the package in the ACL2 read-eval-print loop (see <a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a>) will be the 
 same as their respective values at the time <span class="v">save-exec</span> is called.</p> 
 
 <p>(3) <span class="v">Save-exec</span> generates a small script file (e.g., 
 <span class="v">"my-saved_acl2"</span> in the examples above), similar in form (see (4) below) 
 to the script generated when building ACL2 directly from source code, but with 
 a comment line indicating the time at which the new script is written. 
 <span class="v">Save-exec</span> also saves an associated binary file.  The binary file's name 
 is obtained by putting a suffix on the script filename; for example, if the 
 host Lisp is GCL running on a Linux or Darwin (MacOS) system, then that binary 
 file has the name <span class="v">my-saved_acl2.gcl</span> in the examples above.</p> 
 
 <p>(4) If <span class="v">inert-args</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> (for example if keyword <span class="v">:inert-args</span> 
 is omitted), then when the generated ACL2 script is invoked with command line 
 arguments, those arguments will be passed to the host Lisp; otherwise they 
 will not.  Thus for the example above, suppose we invoke the generated script 
 as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">my-saved_acl2 -a bcd -e fgh</pre> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">my-saved_acl2</span> was generated using a <span class="v">save-exec</span> command with a 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> value specified for keyword <span class="v">:inert-args</span>, then the arguments 
 ``<span class="v">-a bcd -e fgh</span>'' will not be passed to the host Lisp; otherwise, they 
 will be.  Note that for ACL2 executable scripts generated by an ordinary ACL2 
 build from sources, the latter case (i.e., without <span class="v">inert-args</span>) takes 
 place.</p> 
 
 <p>(5) The generated script, which specifies execution with <span class="v">/bin/sh</span>, will 
 generally contain a line of one of the following forms.  (But for SBCL, see 
 (8) below.)  In the examples that follow, <span class="v">ACL2_options</span> is a suitable list 
 of command-line arguments given to the ACL2 executable.  The quoted string 
 <span class="v">"$@"</span> is intended to allow the user to pass additional command-line 
 arguments to that executable.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">host-lisp-args</span> and <span class="v">inert-args</span> are omitted (or <span class="v">nil</span>):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">exec &lt;lisp_executable&gt; &lt;ACL2_options&gt; "$@"</pre> 
 
 <p>More generally, <span class="v">host-lisp-args</span> is inserted immediately after 
 <span class="v">&lt;ACL2_options&gt;</span>, but only if it is non-<span class="v">nil</span> (hence a string).  If 
 <span class="v">inert-args</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, we thus get:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">exec &lt;lisp_executable&gt; &lt;ACL2_options&gt; host-lisp-args "$@"</pre> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">host-lisp-args</span> redefines a value from <span class="v">&lt;ACL2_options&gt;</span>, then it 
 is up to the host lisp which value to use.  For example, experiments show that 
 in CCL, if <span class="v">-Z</span> appears twice, each with a legal value, then the second 
 value is the one that is used (i.e. it does indeed override the original value 
 written out by ACL2 in <span class="v">&lt;ACL2_options&gt;</span>.  But experiments also show that in 
 LispWorks, where ``<span class="v">-init -</span>'' is included in <span class="v">&lt;ACL2_options&gt;</span>, then 
 inclusion of ``<span class="v">-init foo.lisp</span>'' in <span class="v">host-lisp-args</span> is ignored.</p> 
 
 <p>The remaining cases below are for a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value of <span class="v">inert-args</span>. 
 In each case, if <span class="v">host-lisp-args</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> then it should be omitted 
 from the displayed command.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">inert-args</span> is <span class="v">t</span> then an additional argument, `<span class="v">--</span>', 
 indicates that when ACL2 is given command line arguments, these should not be 
 processed by the host Lisp (other than recording them; see (6) below):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">exec &lt;lisp_executable&gt; &lt;ACL2_options&gt; host-lisp-args -- "$@"</pre> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">inert-args</span> is a string then the result is similar to the above, 
 except that <span class="v">inert-args</span> is added immediately after `<span class="v">--</span>':</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">exec &lt;lisp_executable&gt; &lt;ACL2_options&gt; host-lisp-args -- inert-args "$@"</pre> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>(6) See <a href="OSLIB____ARGV.html">oslib::argv</a> for a utility that returns a list of all 
 <span class="v">inert-args</span> from an invocation of ACL2.  See also <a href="ACL2____GETOPT.html">getopt</a> 
 for a convenient way to parse these arguments.</p> 
 
 <p>(7) Suppose that you invoke an ACL2 script, say <span class="v">"my-saved_acl2"</span>, 
 that was generated by <span class="v">save-exec</span>, and then optionally evaluate some forms. 
 Then you may save a new ACL2 script with <span class="v">save-exec</span>.  The new script will 
 contain comment lines that extend comment lines in <span class="v">"my-saved_acl2"</span> with 
 a new write date, but otherwise will be identical to the script that would 
 have been generated by executing the new <span class="v">save-exec</span> call after invoking 
 the original ACL2 executable (built directly from ACL2 sources) instead of 
 <span class="v">"my-saved_acl2"</span>.  In other words, the options added by the earlier 
 <span class="v">save-exec</span> call that created <span class="v">"my-saved_acl2"</span> are discarded by the 
 new <span class="v">save-exec</span> call.  However, the <span class="v">.core</span> file will built on top of 
 the <span class="v">.core</span> file that was consulted when <span class="v">"my-saved_acl2"</span> was 
 invoked.</p> 
 
 <p>(8) The following note pertains only to the case that the host Lisp is 
 SBCL.  For SBCL, the scripts written are analogous to, but slightly different 
 from, those shown above.  Please note that for SBCL, the <span class="v">host-lisp-args</span> 
 are what the SBCL manual calls ``runtime options''.  For SBCL only, an extra 
 keyword argument, <span class="v">:toplevel-args</span>, may be used for specifying what the 
 SBCL manual calls ``toplevel options.  As with <span class="v">:host-lisp-args</span>, this 
 value, <span class="v">toplevel-args</span>, should be <span class="v">nil</span> (the default) or a string.  Here 
 is an example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a> "my-saved_acl2" nil
           :host-lisp-args "--dynamic-space-size 50000"
           :toplevel-args "--eval '(print \"HELLO\")'"
           :inert-args "--my-option my-value")</pre> 
 
 <p>The script generated by this example call of <span class="v">save-exec</span> contains a line 
 such as the following (with the same convention for `\' as before).  Notice 
 that <span class="v">:host-lisp-args</span> can be modified at startup (without <span class="v">save-exec</span>) 
 by setting environment variable <span class="v">SBCL_USER_ARGS</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">exec "/projects/sbcl-1.1.7-x86-64-linux/src/runtime/sbcl" \
     --dynamic-space-size 24000 --control-stack-size 64 \
     --core "/u/smith/my-saved_acl2.core" --dynamic-space-size 50000 \
     ${SBCL_USER_ARGS} \
     --end-runtime-options \
     --no-userinit --eval '(acl2::sbcl-restart)' \
     --eval '(print "HELLO")' \
     --end-toplevel-options \
     --my-option my-value \
     "$@"</pre> 
 
 <p>In general, the generated script is of one of the following forms (with the 
 same convention for `\' as before).</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>For the case that <span class="v">inert-args</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">exec &lt;lisp_executable&gt; \
     &lt;ACL2_runtime_options&gt; host-lisp-args --end-runtime-options \
     &lt;ACL2_toplevel_options&gt; host-lisp-args \
     "$@"</pre> 
 
 <p>For the case that <span class="v">inert-args</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">exec &lt;lisp_executable&gt; \
     &lt;ACL2_runtime_options&gt; host-lisp-args --end-runtime-options \
     &lt;ACL2_toplevel_options&gt; host-lisp-args --end-toplevel-options \
     inert-args "$@"</pre> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>Notice that as before, when the generated script is invoked (for example, 
 at the shell), additional command-line arguments provided at that time are 
 passed to Lisp if and only if <span class="v">inert-args</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.  For SBCL, when 
 they are passed to Lisp they are passed as toplevel options, not as runtime 
 options.</p>
