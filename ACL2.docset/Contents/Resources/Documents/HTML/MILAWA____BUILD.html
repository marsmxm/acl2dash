<p>Instructions for obtaining and building Milawa.</p><p>Milawa has a close relationship with ACL2.  All of its tactics can 
be thought of as both ACL2 and Milawa functions.  The full bootstrapping proof 
is first "sketched" in ACL2, and then "re-discovered" or "formalized" 
with Milawa.</p> 
 
<p>This documentation describes how to build the ACL2-related portion of 
Milawa.  But these instructions <b>do not cover</b> Magnus Myreen's work on 
<a href="MILAWA____JITAWA.html">jitawa</a>, and the HOL4 verification of Milawa's kernel.</p> 
 
<p>The Milawa source code is now included in the <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2 Community Books<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2"></nobr></a> project. 
However, Milawa is not built during the "make" of the ordinary ACL2 Community 
Books, because building it:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>takes several hours</li> 
<li>requires a lot of memory and hard disk space, and</li> 
<li>requires Clozure Common Lisp (CCL).</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Instead, to build Milawa, you should:</p> 
 
<ol> 
 
<li>Build CCL and ACL2 according to the instructions in 
<span class="v">books/centaur/README.html</span>.</li> 
 
<li>Then run these commands: 
<pre class="code">$ cd acl2/books/projects/milawa/ACL2
$ make -j &lt;n&gt;                 # n is how many jobs to run in parallel</pre> 
 
Where <span class="v">&lt;n&gt;</span> is appropriate for your computer, e.g.: 
<ul> 
<li>As large as possible, but</li> 
<li>No more than your number of CPU cores, to avoid excessive 
    task switching overhead.</li> 
<li>No more than (Physical_Memory / 4 GB), to avoid death by swapping.</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
 
</ol> 
 
<p>A successful build should result in:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Several new ACL2 images in <span class="v">acl2/books/projects/milawa/ACL2/acl2-images/</span> 
including one called <span class="v">user-symmetry</span>
</li> 
 
<li>ACL2 certificates (.cert) or "ACL2 Milawa Provisional 
Certificates" (.mpcert) for files throughout the milawa/ACL2 directory</li> 
 
<li>Thousands of proof files throughout the <span class="v">milawa/Proofs</span> directory.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>These proof files are the "boostrapping proofs" that can now be checked by 
the Milawa kernel.  There are many options here: Milawa has two kernels:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The original kernel, a Common Lisp program that has historically been run 
successfully on at least CCL, SBCL, CMUCL, and (for the very patient) CLISP, on 
certain platforms.  In this case, the proof files can be processed 
directly.</li> 
 
<li>The new kernel, either a Common Lisp or Jitawa Lisp program, that can be 
run on at least CCL, SBCL, and Jitawa (a verified Lisp by Magnus Myreen).  In 
this case, the proof files first need to be further collected and 
compressed.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>See <a href="MILAWA____FINAL-CHECKS.html">final-checks</a> for information about how to build the Milawa 
kernel on your choice of Lisps, and how to use it to check these proofs.</p>
