<p>Throw away any <span class="v">initial</span> statements and add non-fatal <a href="VL2014____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a> to the affected modules.</p><p>This transform can be run at any time, but it is typically done 
somewhere before <a href="VL2014____ALWAYS-TOP.html">always-top</a>, since some always-block code may be 
reluctant to process modules with <span class="v">initial</span> statements.</p> 
 
<p>Initial statements can be important for simulation, but are meaningless if 
we want to consider the post synthesis/build behavior of the actual part. 
Throwing them away, then, is basically reasonable for any back-end tool that 
wants to analyze the behavior of the synthesized modules.</p>
