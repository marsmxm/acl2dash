<p>The main fields are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">rchars</span> -- holds the printed elements (characters and strings) in 
reverse order.  The is badly named because originally it only held characters, 
but we later extended it to strings to make string-printing more 
efficient.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">col</span> -- records the current column number.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>These fields are typically altered by every printing function.</p> 
 
<p>The printer also includes some configuration fields which allow you to 
influence the behavior of certain printing functions.  These fields are 
typically not changed by printing functions.  They can also be easily loaded 
and saved into a <a href="VL2014____VL-PSCONFIG-P.html">vl-psconfig-p</a> object.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">autowrap-col</span>, a column number for autowrapping,</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">autowrap-ind</span>, number of spaces to indent after autowrapping,</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">htmlp</span>, a flag indicating whether we are printing html,</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">tabsize</span>, the tab size to use for &amp;nbsp; expansion in html mode,</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">package</span>, a symbol which specifies the "home" package for printing 
symbols (e.g., <span class="v">ACL2::foo</span> vs. <span class="v">VL2014::foo</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">base</span>, a <a href="ACL2____PRINT-BASE-P.html">print-base-p</a> for base 10, 16, etc.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Finally, the printer includes a <span class="v">misc</span> field which must be an alist, and 
which can be used to pass along any custom parameters that your own printing 
functions would like to inspect.</p> 
 
<p>I once considered changing the way <span class="v">ps</span> works, so that we would use an 
array of characters and write into the array, instead of consing characters. 
This is appealing because we might be able to avoid consing during printing at 
the cost of having to allocate a buffer at the beginning.  But, preliminary 
tests suggested that there is not much of a speed improvement, and while it 
might have some nice memory characteristics, the current solution is 
particularly nice in that it makes <a href="VL2014____WITH-LOCAL-PS.html">with-local-ps</a> very cheap, etc.</p> 
 
<p>We generally hide the existence of <span class="v">ps</span> by introducing <span class="v">ps</span>-free 
wrapper <a href="VL2014____PS-MACROS.html">ps-macros</a>.  We ask that you not use the primitive stobj 
functions directly, but instead use these wrappers.</p>
