<p>Control output during CCG termination analysis</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CCG-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-ccg-inhibit-output-lst</a> '(query))
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CCG-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-ccg-inhibit-output-lst</a> '(build/refine size-change))

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-CCG-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-ccg-inhibit-output-lst</a> lst)</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">lst</span> is a form (which may mention <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>) that evaluates 
 to a list of names, each of which is the name of one of the following 
 ``kinds'' of output produced by the CCG termination analysis.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"> query prints the goal, restrictions, and results of each prover 
  query (for a discussion on displaying actual proofs, see 
  <span class="v">set-ccg-display-proofs</span>(yet to be documented).  basics the basic CCG 
  output, enough to follow along, but concise enough to keep from drowning in 
  output performance performance information for the size change analysis 
  build/refine the details of CCG construction and refinement size-change the 
  details of size change analysis counter-example prints out a counter-example 
  that can be useful for debugging failed termination proof attempts.  </pre> 
 
 <p>It is possible to inhibit each kind of output by putting the corresponding 
 name into <span class="v">lst</span>.  For example, if <span class="v">'query</span> is included in (the value of) 
 <span class="v">lst</span>, then no information about individual queries is printed during CCG 
 analysis.</p> 
 
 <p>The default setting is <span class="v">'(query performance build/refine size-change)</span>. 
 That is, by default only the basic CCG information and counter-example (in the 
 case of a failed proof attempt) are printed. This should hopefully be adequate 
 for most users.</p>
