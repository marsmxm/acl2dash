<div class="box"><p>Note: this example might be better written as a <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">ACL2::define</a>, 
which is much like a <span class="v">defsection</span> but has additional features.</p></div> 
 
<h3>Overview</h3> 
 
<p>Like an <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>, a <span class="v">defsection</span> introduces a new scope for 
<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> events.  This is often useful when you are trying to prove a 
theorem that requires some lemmas: by proving the lemmas locally, you can 
prevent them from affecting the rest of your book.</p> 
 
<p>It is often useful to organize books into sections.  There are a few minor 
reasons you might prefer using <span class="v">defsection</span> for this, instead of plain 
<span class="v">encapsulate</span>s.  For instance,</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>It is easier to identify in the <span class="v">:pbt</span> history, and</li> 
 
<li>It indents more nicely than <span class="v">encapsulate</span> in a vanilla emacs.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>But the main reasons to use <span class="v">defsection</span> are its documentation features. 
The definitions and theorems within a section can be <b>automatically</b> 
included in the documentation page for that section, along with any running 
commentary.  This helps to avoid copying-and-pasting code into the manual, and 
keeps it up-to-date as the code changes.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Ordinary Sections</h3> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">:parents</span>, <span class="v">:short</span>, and <span class="v">:long</span> keywords are optional.  If 
any of these keywords are provided, they will be used to introduce a <a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> command; otherwise no documentation will be generated.</p> 
 
<p>By default, the <span class="v">:long</span> string you give will be automatically extended 
with a "Definitions and Theorems" part that lists all of the (non-local, 
non-redundant) definitions and theorems introduced in the section.</p> 
 
<p>For instance, in the above example, the <span class="v">:long</span> field would be extended 
with:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">&lt;h3&gt;Definition and Theorems&lt;/h3&gt;

@(def foo)
@(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> foo-thm1)
@(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> foo-thm2)

&lt;p&gt;NOTE: the next theorem is really useful, but we keep it disabled
  because it gets too expensive when...&lt;/p&gt;

@(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> foo-thm3)</pre> 
 
<p>If you do not want this automatic documentation, you can turn it off with 
<span class="v">:autodoc nil</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Extended Sections</h3> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">:extension</span> keyword allows you to say that this section is a 
continuation of a previously introduced concept.</p> 
 
<p>When <span class="v">:extension topic</span> is provided, then <span class="v">topic</span> must be the name of 
a previously documented <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> section, and you are not allowed to use 
<span class="v">:parents</span> or <span class="v">:short</span> since the topic already exists.  Note that whereas 
topics can have multiple parents, you can only extend a single topic at a 
time.</p> 
 
<p>The main purpose of an <span class="v">:extension</span> section is to add additional 
documentation, either via the <span class="v">:long</span> string or via the automatic events and 
commentary.  The documentation obtained this way is just appended onto the 
existing <span class="v">:long</span> for the topic.</p> 
 
<p>For example, say we have already defined the above <span class="v">foo</span> section in some 
"basic" book.  We might then want to add some additional "advanced" 
theorems about it in some other book.  We could do this via:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSECTION.html">defsection</a> advanced-theorems-about-foo
  :extension foo

  "&lt;p&gt;Additional theorems are also available in the @('advanced') book.  (We
    don't include these in the basic book since they take a long time to
    prove.)&lt;/p&gt;"

  (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> foo-thm4 ...)
  (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> foo-thm5 ...))</pre> 
 
<p>This will result in the commentary and definitions of <span class="v">foo-thm4</span> and 
<span class="v">foo-thm5</span> being added onto the end of the documentation for <span class="v">foo</span>.</p>
