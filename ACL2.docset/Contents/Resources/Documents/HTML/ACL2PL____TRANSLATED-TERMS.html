<p>A formalization of ACL2 translated terms.</p><p>ACL2 <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">terms</a> may be 
     untranslated (i.e. user-facing) or translated (i.e. internal). 
     Here we formalize translated terms, 
     which we essentially regard as 
     abstract syntax of the ACL2 programming language. 
     We may also formalize untranslated terms at some point, 
     but for now it seems that translated terms should suffice 
     for an initial formalization of the ACL2 programming language.</p><p>We formalize translated terms as free algebraic structures, 
     without the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>-related constraints 
     (e.g. that all function symbols are in the world), 
     and even without some of the constraints included in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> 
     (e.g. that the number of actual arguments of a lambda call 
     matches the number of parameters of the lambda expression). 
     These well-formedness constraints may be formalized separately.</p><p>We use (free) fixtypes to formalize translated terms. 
     As noted above, these fixtypes are a bit larger than <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span>. 
     Thus, the fixtypes introduced here differ slightly from <a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-FTY.html">the pseudo-term fixtypes</a>, which are consistent with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> 
     and also include an explicit notion of `null' term.</p>
