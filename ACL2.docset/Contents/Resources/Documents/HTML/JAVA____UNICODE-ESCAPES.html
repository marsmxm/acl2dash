<p>First Java lexical translation step: Unicode escapes [JLS:3.3].</p><p>A Java program is a finite sequence of Unicode characters 
     satisfying a number of constraints. 
     The first set of constraints is described in [JLS:3.3], 
     which also describes how 
     a sequence of Unicode characters satisfying these constraints 
     is turned into another sequence of Unicode characters, 
     which is then subjected to 
     further constraint checks and associated transformations.</p><p>The grammar rules in [JLS:3.3] express 
     part of this first set of constraints, 
     but they are ambiguous if taken alone: 
     one could always choose the <span class="v">raw-input-character</span> alternative 
     for <span class="v">unicode-input-character</span>, 
     without recognizing any <span class="v">unicode-escape</span>, 
     and therefore leave the original Unicode sequence unchanged. 
     The English text in [JLS:3.3] provides additional constraints.</p><p>One additional constraint in this first set is that, 
     in order for a Unicode escape to be recognized 
     (i.e. in order for <span class="v">unicode-escape</span> to be chosen), 
     the backslash that starts the escape must be preceded 
     by an even number of backslashes. 
     Without this constraint, it would be impossible, for example, 
     to have the Java literal string 
     <span class="v">"The Unicode escape \\u0020 is the ASCII space character."</span>, 
     where the double backslash is 
     a (non-Unicode) escape sequence for a single backslash [JLS:3.10.6]: 
     without the constraint, this Java literal string would be equivalent to 
     <span class="v">"The Unicode escape \  is the ASCII space character."</span>. 
     [JLS:3.3] introduces the notion of `eligible' backslash 
     as one preceded by an even number of backslashes (possibly none). 
     In the example string above, 
     the backslash just before the <span class="v">u</span> is not eligible, 
     because it is preceded by an odd number of backslashes.</p><p>For each eligible backslash, there are two cases: 
     either the eligible backslash is followed by one or more <span class="v">u</span> letters, 
     or it is not. 
     In the second case, there is no Unicode escape, 
     because the grammar requires the presence of one or more <span class="v">u</span> letters; 
     the backslash must be presumably 
     the start of a (non-Unicode) escape sequence [JLS:3.10.6], 
     e.g. the backslash in the Java string literal 
     <span class="v">"A line.\nAnother line."</span> 
     is eligible, 
     but there is no Unicode escape.</p><p>If instead an eligible backslash is followed by one or more <span class="v">u</span> letters, 
     there are two sub-cases: 
     either the last <span class="v">u</span> is followed by four hexadecimal digits, 
     or it is not. 
     In the second sub-case, 
     the original sequence of Unicode characters is not a valid Java program; 
     none of the (non-Unicode) escape sequences [JSL:3.10.6] 
     has <span class="v">u</span> following the backslash. 
     In the first sub-case, 
     we have a possible Unicode escape according to the grammar, 
     and it must be recognized as such, 
     thus removing the inherent grammatical ambiguity.</p><p>We formalize the processing of Unicode escapes via a function 
     from lists of Unicode characters to lists of Unicode characters 
     that recognizes the Unicode escapes according to the above rules 
     and turns them into the corresponding single Unicode characters. 
     This function is constructed as the composition of 
     (i) a parser from lists of Unicode characters 
     to lists of <span class="v">unicode-input-character</span> trees 
     and (ii) an abstractor from lists of <span class="v">unicode-input-character</span> trees 
     to lists of Unicode characters.</p><p>The parser always succeeds, 
     even if there is an eligible backslash 
     followed by one of more <span class="v">u</span> letters 
     but with the last <span class="v">u</span> not followed by four hexadecimal digits 
     (in which case, as noted above, the processing of Unicode escapes fails). 
     In this case, the parser just leaves the characters as they are, 
     without recognizing any Unicode escape (since there is not one). 
     This makes the parser slightly more general, 
     and perhaps useful in other circumstances. 
     Presumably [JLS] prescribes an error in this situation 
     (as opposed to simply leaving the characters unchanged) 
     because the resulting Unicode character sequence 
     could never be a valid Java program anyhow, 
     and so parsing can stop immediately instead of stopping later anyhow. 
     Nonetheless, when we compose the parser with the abstractor (see above), 
     we perform the check for that situation, 
     and return an error if the situation occurs, 
     as prescribed by [JLS]. 
     In other words, our formalization of Unicode escape processing 
     is faithful to [JLS], 
     but its parser component is a bit more general.</p>
