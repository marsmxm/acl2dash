<p>(macro) 
replay one or more instructions</p><pre class="code">Examples:
REPLAY     -- replay all instructions in the current session
              (i.e., state-stack)
(REPLAY 5) -- replay the most recent 5 instructions
(REPLAY 5
        (<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">COMMENT</a> deleted dive command here))
           -- replace the 5th most recent instruction with the
              indicated comment instruction, and then replay it
              followed by the remaining 4 instructions

General Form:
(REPLAY &amp;OPTIONAL n replacement-instruction)</pre> 
 
 <p>Replay the last <span class="v">n</span> instructions if <span class="v">n</span> is a positive integer; else 
 <span class="v">n</span> should be <span class="v">nil</span> or not supplied, and replay all instructions. 
 However, if <span class="v">replacement-instruction</span> is supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>, then 
 before the replay, replace the <span class="v">nth</span> instruction (from the most recent, as 
 shown by <span class="v">commands</span>) with <span class="v">replacement-instruction</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If this command ``fails'', then the <span class="v">restore</span> command will revert the 
 state-stack to its value present before the <span class="v">replay</span> instruction was 
 executed.</p>
