<p>ACL2 Version  3.3 (November, 2007) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we roughly organize the changes since Version 3.2.1 into new 
 features, bug fixes, prover algorithm enhancements, and miscellaneous.  Also 
 see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-3-2-1.html">note-3-2-1</a> for other changes since Version 3.2.</p> 
 
 <p><b>NEW FEATURES</b></p> 
 
 <p>A new ``gag-mode'' provides less verbose, more helpful feedback from the 
 theorem prover, in support of The Method (see <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a>).  See <a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a>.  We recommend the use of gag-mode, which may become the default 
 in future ACL2 releases, and we welcome suggestions for improvement.  We thank 
 Robert Krug and Sandip Ray for helpful feedback in the design of <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a>.  Note that when proofs fail, then even without gag-mode and even if 
 proof output is inhibited, the summary will contain a useful listing of 
 so-called ``key checkpoints'' (see <a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Added support for a leading `<span class="v">~</span>' in filenames.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for 
 suggesting this enhancement.  Note that since `<span class="v">~/</span>' depends on the user, 
 it is disallowed in <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> to be certified (see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a>), 
 since otherwise an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form in a book, <span class="v">b</span>, could have a 
 different meaning at certification time than at the time <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 is later executed on book <span class="v">b</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Made a change to allow <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a> FORM)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-TIME-LIMIT.html">with-prover-time-limit</a>
 TIME FORM)</span> when <span class="v">FORM</span> includes <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> calls that change the 
 ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for requesting such support for 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Computed <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> (see <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>) may now produce a 
 so-called ``error triple'', i.e., a result of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val
 state)</span>, where a non-<span class="v">nil</span> <span class="v">erp</span> causes an error, and otherwise 
 <span class="v">val</span> is the value of the hint.  It remains legal for a computed hint to 
 return a single ordinary value; indeed, the symbol form of a computed hint 
 must still be a function that returns an ordinary single value.</p> 
 
 <p>New hints provide additional control of the theorem prover, as follows. 
 See <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> for more details, and see new distributed book directory 
 <span class="v">books/hints/</span> for examples, in particular file <span class="v">basic-tests.lisp</span> in 
 that directory for simple examples.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>o The hint <span class="v">:OR (hints-1 ... hints-k)</span> causes an attempt to prove the 
 specified goal using each <span class="v">hints-i</span> in turn, until the first of these 
 succeeds.  If none succeeds, then the prover proceeds after heuristically 
 choosing the ``best'' result, taking into account the goals pushed in each 
 case for proof by induction.</p> 
 
 <p>o A custom hint is a keyword that the user associates with a corresponding 
 hint-generating function by invoking <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-CUSTOM-KEYWORD-HINT.html">add-custom-keyword-hint</a></span>.  Thus, a 
 custom hint may be viewed as a convenient sort of computed hint.</p> 
 
 <p>o A custom hint, <span class="v">:MERGE</span>, is implemented in distributed book 
 <span class="v">books/hints/merge.lisp</span>.  It is useful for combining hints.</p> 
 
 <p>o A sophisticated yet useful custom hint is the <span class="v">:CONSIDER</span> hint 
 implemented in distributed book <span class="v">books/hints/consider-hint.lisp</span>.  With 
 this hint, you can for example give the equivalent of a <span class="v">:USE</span> hint without 
 the need to supply an instantiation.  Include that book in order to see 
 documentation online with <span class="v">:doc consideration</span>, and see the book 
 <span class="v">books/hints/consider-hint-tests.lisp</span> for examples.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>A new hint, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REORDER.html">reorder</a></span>, allows the specification of which 
 subgoals are to be considered first.  Thanks to Sandip Ray for putting forward 
 this idea.</p> 
 
 <p>Enhanced <span class="v">set-saved-output</span> by supporting a second argument of 
 <span class="v">:same</span>, which avoids changing which output is inhibited.</p> 
 
 <p>Added macros <span class="v">thm?</span> and <span class="v">not-thm?</span> to distributed book 
 <span class="v">books/make-event/eval.lisp</span>, so that it's easy to test within a certified 
 book that a proof attempt succeeds or that it fails.</p> 
 
 <p>Added printing function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW_12.html">cw!</a></span>, which is analogous to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span> just 
 as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT_12.html">fmt!</a></span> is to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span>, i.e., printing so that the result can be 
 read back in.  Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting this enhancement (after 
 doing his own implementation).</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 customization file can now be specified using environment variable 
 <span class="v">ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION</span> [note: starting with Version_4.0, 
 <span class="v">ACL2_CUSTOMIZATION</span>].  See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-CUSTOMIZATION.html">ACL2-customization</a>.  Thanks to Peter 
 Dillinger for requesting this feature.</p> 
 
 <p>Added new emacs capabilities for proof trees (all documented in emacs):</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>o New function start-proof-tree-noninteractive, for example<br> 
 
   (start-proof-tree-noninteractive "*shell*")</p> 
 
 <p>o C-z o Switch to another frame</p> 
 
 <p>o C-z b Switch to prooftree buffer</p> 
 
 <p>o C-z B Switch to prooftree buffer in "prooftree-frame" 
 frame</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>Added Common Lisp function, <span class="v">search</span>, as a macro in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode, 
 with limited support for keyword arguments.  Thanks to Warren Hunt for 
 requesting this addition.</p> 
 
 <p>Sandip Ray has contributed a book, <span class="v">books/make-event/defrefine.lisp</span>, 
 that provides a collection of macros to aid in reasoning about ACL2 functions 
 via refinement.</p> 
 
 <p>Wrote and incorporated new utility for listing all the theorems in an 
 included book.  See <span class="v">books/misc/book-thms.lisp</span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 requesting this functionality.</p> 
 
 <p>The new distributed book <span class="v">misc/defp.lisp</span> generalizes the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPUN.html">defpun</a></span> 
 macro to allow more general forms of tail recursion.</p> 
 
 <p>(Low-level printing improvement) A new function, 
 <span class="v">set-ppr-flat-right-margin</span>, allows the right margin for certain kinds of 
 ``flat'' printing to exceed column 40.  Thanks to Jared Davis for pointing out 
 that state global variables <span class="v">'fmt-hard-right-margin</span> and 
 <span class="v">'fmt-soft-right-margin</span> are not alone sufficient to extend the right 
 margin in all cases.</p> 
 
 <p>The event <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a></span> can now take a relative pathname as 
 an argument.  Formerly, it required an absolute pathname.</p> 
 
 <p>A new book, <span class="v">books/misc/defopener.lisp</span>, provides a utility creating a 
 theorem that equates a term with its simplification.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 now provides limited support for the Common Lisp primitive <span class="v">FLET</span>, 
 which supports local function bindings.  See <a href="COMMON-LISP____FLET.html">flet</a>.  Thanks to Warren 
 Hunt for requesting this feature.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a definition of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BOOLE_42.html">boole$</a></span>, a close analogue of Common Lisp 
 function <span class="v">boole</span>.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for providing an initial 
 implementation.</p> 
 
 <p><b>BUG FIXES</b></p> 
 
 <p>Fixed <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> to inhibit a potentially useless theory warning.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in the application of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> to relative 
 pathnames for files in other than the current directory.  Thanks to Amr Helmy 
 for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span> for displaying rules 
 of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for finding this bug and 
 providing a fix.</p> 
 
 <p>Formerly, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-default-backchain-limit</a></span> was not a legal event form 
 for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> forms and <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  This has been fixed.  Thanks 
 to Robert Krug and Sandip Ray for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed the handling of <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> in <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> commands for the 
 prover, such as <span class="v">bash</span> — see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER-COMMANDS.html">proof-builder-commands</a> — so 
 that the user can override the default settings of hints, in particular of 
 <span class="v">:do-not</span> and <span class="v">:do-not-induct</span> hints attached to <span class="v">"Goal"</span>.  This 
 fix also applies to the distributed book <span class="v">misc/bash.lisp</span>, where Robert 
 Krug noticed that he got an error with <span class="v">:hints (("Goal" :do-not
 '(preprocess)))</span>; we thank Robert for pointing out this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in handling of <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s occurring in guards of functions 
 whose <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s have been verified.  In such cases, a raw Lisp error was 
 possible when proving theorems about non-''live'' <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s.  We thank 
 Daron Vroon for sending us an example that highlighted this bug.  The 
 following (simpler) example causes such an error in previous versions of 
 ACL2.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> st fld)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (st)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :stobjs st :guard (fld st)))
  st)
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (foo '(3))
            '(3)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____DMR.html">dmr</a> feature for dynamic monitoring of rewrites had a bug, where 
 the file used for communicating with emacs was the same for all users, based 
 on who built the ACL2 executable image.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to 
 Robert Krug for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in some warnings, in particular the warning for including an 
 uncertified book, that was giving an incorrect warning summary string.</p> 
 
 <p>Inclusion of uncertified books erroneously re-used <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> 
 expansions that were stored in stale <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>s.  This is no longer 
 the case.  Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was disallowing calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a></span> in <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> that were executing before calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified the functionality of <span class="v">binop-table</span> so other than binary 
 function symbols are properly supported (hence with no action based on 
 right-associated arguments).  See <a href="ACL2____ADD-BINOP.html">add-binop</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed small <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> issues related to packages.  Emacs 
 commands <span class="v">ctrl-t d</span> and <span class="v">ctrl-t ctrl-d</span> now work properly with colon 
 (`<span class="v">:</span>') and certain other punctuation characters.  The <span class="v">p-top</span> command 
 now prints ``<span class="v">***</span>'' regardless of the current package.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that allowed <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> to succeed without specifying 
 value <span class="v">t</span> for keyword argument <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp</span>, even with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in the certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> depending on 
 events executed under <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SHOW-ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">show-accumulated-persistence</a></span> in the following two ways. 
 Thanks to Robert Krug and Bill Young for requesting these improvements and for 
 providing useful feedback.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>o It can provide more complete information when aborting a proof.</p> 
 
 <p>o The <span class="v">:frames</span> reported for a rule are categorized as ``useful'' and 
 ``useless'' according to whether they support ``useful'' or ``useless'' 
 <span class="v">:tries</span> of that rule, respectively.  See <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> 
 for further explanation.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>Modified <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> so that the reported time and warnings include 
 those from the expansion phase.  In analogy with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____PROGN.html">progn</a></span>, the rules reported still do not include those from subsidiary 
 events (including the expansion phase).  A related change to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> avoids 
 resetting summary information (time, warnings) with each top-level form 
 evaluation; <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> already handle this information themselves.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a></span> so that all warnings are inhibited 
 when <span class="v">warning!</span> but not <span class="v">warning</span> is included in the list.  Formerly, 
 only soundness-related warnings were inhibited in this case.  Thanks to Eric 
 Smith for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Distributed directory <span class="v">doc/HTML/</span> now again includes installation 
 instructions (which was missing in Version_3.2.1), in 
 <span class="v">doc/HTML/installation/installation.html</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Some fixes have been made for <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> support.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>o <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">Proof-tree</a> output is no longer inhibited automatically during 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, though it continues to be inhibited by default (i.e., 
 ACL2 continues to start up as though <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a></span> has been 
 called with argument <span class="v">'(<a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>)</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>o Fixed a bug in Xemacs support for <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> help keys <span class="v">C-z h</span> 
 and <span class="v">C-z ?</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>o Fixed a bug in <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a>s that was failing to deal with the case 
 that a goal pushed for proof by induction is subsumed by such a goal to be 
 proved later.  Now, the proof-tree display regards such subsumed goals as 
 proved, as is reported in the theorem prover's output.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was disallowing <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a></span> forms inside <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> forms in a certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> (see <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>If the <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> argument of a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 is <span class="v">:comp</span>, then an existing compiled file will be loaded, provided it is 
 more recent than the corresponding book (i.e., <span class="v">.lisp</span> file).  A bug was 
 causing the compiled file to be deleted and then reconstructed in the case of 
 <span class="v">:comp</span>, where this behavior was intended only for <span class="v">:comp!</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was avoiding compilation of some executable counterparts 
 (sometimes called ``*1* functions'') during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, and also 
 during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> with <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> value of <span class="v">:comp</span> 
 or <span class="v">:comp!</span>).  Thanks to Eric Smith for sending a small example to bring 
 this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Incorporated a fix from Eric Smith for a typo (source function 
 <span class="v">ancestors-check1</span>) that could cause hard Lisp errors.  Thanks, Eric!</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed the following issues with packages and book <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>s.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____HIDDEN-DEATH-PACKAGE.html">hidden-death-package</a> if you are generally interested in such issues, 
 and for associated examples, see comments on ``Fixed the following issues with 
 packages'' in <span class="v">note-3-3</span> in the ACL2 source code.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>o Reduced the size of <span class="v">.cert</span> files by eliminating some unnecessary 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> events generated for the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>o Fixed a bug that has caused errors when reading symbols from a <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> that are in undefined packages defined in locally included 
 books.</p> 
 
 <p>o Fixed a bug that could lead to failure of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> caused by 
 a subtle interaction between <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-IGNORE-OK.html">set-ignore-ok</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> events 
 generated for the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of a <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p><b>PROVER ALGORITHM ENHANCEMENTS</b></p> 
 
 <p>Non-linear arithmetic (see <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>) has been improved 
 to be more efficient or more powerful in some cases.  Thanks to Robert Krug 
 for contributing these improvements.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved certain (so-called ``<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a></span>'') reasoning about whether 
 or not expressions denote integers.  Thanks to Robert Krug for contributing 
 code to implement this change, along with examples illustrating its power that 
 are now distributed in the book 
 <span class="v">books/misc/integer-type-set-test.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved ACL2's heuristics for relieving hypotheses, primarily to use 
 linear reasoning on conjuncts and disjuncts of the test of an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> 
 expression.  For example, given a hypothesis of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> term1
 term2) ...)</span>, ACL2 will now use linear reasoning to attempt to prove both 
 <span class="v">term1</span> and <span class="v">term2</span>, not merely for <span class="v">term2</span>.  Thanks to Robert Krug 
 for supplying examples illustrating the desirability of such an improvement 
 and for useful discussions about the fix.</p> 
 
 <p>Made a slight heuristic change, so that when a hypothesis with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> 
 or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> subterms (i.e. <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span> subterms) rewrites to <span class="v">t</span>, 
 then that hypothesis is necessarily eliminated.  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 sending an example that led us to develop this change, and thanks to Robert 
 Krug for a helpful discussion.</p> 
 
 <p><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></p> 
 
 <p>Added documentation on how to use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> to avoid duplicating 
 expensive computations, thanks to Jared Davis.  See <a href="ACL2____USING-TABLES-EFFICIENTLY.html">using-tables-efficiently</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified the error message for calls of undefined functions to show the 
 arguments.  Thanks to Bob Boyer for requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified utilities <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR_12.html">pr!</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span>, and 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SHOW-BODIES.html">show-bodies</a></span> to incorporate code contributed by Jared Davis. 
 That code defines low-level source functions <span class="v">info-for-xxx</span> that collect 
 information about rules, which is thus available to advanced users.</p> 
 
 <p>Dynamic monitoring of rewrites (see <a href="ACL2____DMR.html">dmr</a>) has been improved in the 
 following ways, as suggested by Robert Krug.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>o Some stale entries from the rewrite stack are no longer printed, in 
 particular above <span class="v">ADD-POLYNOMIAL-INEQUALITIES</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>o An additional rewrite stack entry is made when entering non-linear 
 arithmetic (see <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>o An <span class="v">ADD-POLYNOMIAL-INEQUALITIES</span> entry is printed with a counter, to 
 show how often this process is called.</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>Modified <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a></span> so that the newly-saved image will have the same 
 raw Lisp package as the existing saved image.  This is a very technical change 
 that will likely not impact most users; for example, the package in the ACL2 
 read-eval-print loop (see <a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a>) had already persisted from the original 
 to newly-saved image.  Thanks to Jared Davis for suggesting this change.</p> 
 
 <p>Changed <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> expansion so that changes to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a></span>, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-CLAUSE-IDS.html">set-print-clause-ids</a></span>, <span class="v">set-fmt-soft-right-margin</span>, and 
 <span class="v">set-fmt-hard-right-margin</span> will persist after being evaluated during 
 <span class="v">make-event</span> expansion.  (Specifically, 
 <span class="v">*protected-system-state-globals*</span> has been modified; see <a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT-DETAILS.html">make-event-details</a>.)  Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing this issue to our 
 attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Output from the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a> is now always enabled when invoking 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">verify</a></span>, even if it is globally inhibited (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the message printed when an <span class="v">:induct</span> hint fails, to give more 
 information in some cases.  Thanks to Rex Page for suggesting where an 
 improvement could be made and providing useful feedback on an initial 
 improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>Added a warning for <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> rules (see <a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a>) that 
 specify <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a></span> as the second equivalence relation when <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span> can 
 be used instead.  Those who heed these warnings can eliminate certain 
 subsequent <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a></span> warnings for <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rules with 
 conclusions of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> term1 term2)</span>, and hence implicitly for 
 Boolean conclusions <span class="v">term1</span> that are interpreted as <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> term1 t)</span>. 
 Thanks to Sarah Weissman for sending us an example that highlighted the need 
 for such a warning.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified macro <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REDEF_12.html">redef!</a></span> (which is for system implementors) so 
 that it eliminates untouchables.</p> 
 
 <p>Several improvements have been made to the experimental hons/memoization 
 version of ACL2.  See <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The distributed books directory, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> distributed-books-dir)</span>, is now 
 printed in the start-up message.</p>
