<p>The Pedersen hash for the Ethereum Semaphore.</p><p>This is specified in Section 5.3.2 of <a href="https://github.com/appliedzkp/semaphore/blob/master/spec/Semaphore%20Spec.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>https://github.com/appliedzkp/semaphore/blob/master/spec/Semaphore%20Spec.pdf<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/appliedzkp/semaphore/blob/master/spec/Semaphore%20Spec.pdf"></nobr></a> and also, in more detail, in <a href="https://iden3-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/4b929e0f96aef77b75bb5cfc0f832151/Pedersen-Hash.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>https://iden3-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/4b929e0f96aef77b75bb5cfc0f832151/Pedersen-Hash.pdf<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://iden3-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_downloads/4b929e0f96aef77b75bb5cfc0f832151/Pedersen-Hash.pdf"></nobr></a>. In the documentation of our formalization of Pedersen hash, 
     we use `[ES]' (for `Ethereum Specification`) to refer to the first 
     and `[IS]' (for `Iden3 Specification`) to refer to the second. 
     There appear to be a few discrepancies between the two, 
     although there should not be any; 
     we will update our specification and documentation 
     as these discrepancies are discussed and resolved.</p><p>Note that the Pedersen hash formalized here differs from <a href="ZCASH____PEDERSEN-HASH.html">the one in Zcash</a>; in particular, this one uses 4-bit windows, 
     while the one in Zcash uses 3-bit windows. 
     Yet, the two share obvious characteristics. 
     In the future, we may formalize a generic form of Pedersen hash, 
     obtaining the Ethereum Semaphore one and the Zcash one 
     by suitably instantiating and specializing the generic one.</p>
