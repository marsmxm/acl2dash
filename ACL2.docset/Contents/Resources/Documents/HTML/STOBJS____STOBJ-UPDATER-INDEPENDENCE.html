<p>Discussion of the accessor/updater independence or <i>frame problem</i>, 
          especially as it relates to the <a href="ACL2____DEF-UPDATER-INDEPENDENCE-THM.html">def-updater-independence-thm</a> utility.</p><p>Note: This is related to what is known as the frame problem in 
philosophy/artificial intelligence/logic; for a broader discussion see <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frame-problem/" target="_blank"><nobr>this

<p>When reasoning about structured data in ACL2, especially stobjs, one 
commonly needs to know that a given updater has no effect on a given accessor. 
During the development of any large program involving such a structured object, 
the number and complexity of accessor and updater functions tends to grow until 
the ad-hoc approach to the problem (proving each such theorem as it is needed) 
becomes unworkable.</p> 
 
<p>In the ad hoc approach, a given data structure might require a number of 
theorems close to the product of the structure's accessor and updater count. 
For many programs this isn't so large that it is impossible to generate and 
prove all such theorems, but we propose a much more scalable approach here.</p> 
 
<h3>Proposed Approach</h3> 
 
<p>Broadly speaking, the approach requires the following two sorts of theorems:</p> 
 
<p>The approach described here (and implemented by <a href="ACL2____DEF-UPDATER-INDEPENDENCE-THM.html">def-updater-independence-thm</a> relies on indexed accesses and updates of the 
structure.  That is, there should be a single accessor and a single updater 
function in terms of which all primitive accesses and updates can be logically 
described, such as <span class="v">nth</span>/<span class="v">update-nth</span>, <span class="v">assoc</span>/<span class="v">acons</span>, or 
<span class="v">g</span>/<span class="v">s</span>.  If the data structure in question doesn't have such a single 
accessor/updater, it is easy (though perhaps tedious) to define them.</p> 
 
<p>The main idea is to prove two kinds of theorems that work together:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>For each accessor, a theorem stating sufficient conditions under which the 
accessor applied to two different structures produces equal results.</li> 
 
<li>For each updater, one or more theorems stating that the updater does not 
change certain fields or accessor applications.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h4>Example 1</h4> 
<p>The following theorem states that as long as element 3 of 
two objects are equal, the <span class="v">access-3rd</span> of those two stobjs is equal:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> 3 new) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> 3 old))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (access-3rd new) (access-3rd old)))</pre> 
 
<p>Note that if we interpret this as a rewrite rule, the variable <span class="v">old</span> is 
free, which would greatly limit is usefulness.  We use a <a href="ACL2____BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a> 
hypothesis to strategically bind <span class="v">old</span> to a good candidate; see below.</p> 
 
<p>The following theorem states that for any element other than number 4, 
<span class="v">update-4th</span> of an object preserves that element:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> n) 4))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> n (update-4th val x))
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> n x)))</pre> 
 
<p>These two rules can be used with the bind-free strategy below to prove:</p> 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (access-3rd (update-4th val x)) (access-3rd x))</pre> 
 
<h4>Example 2</h4> 
<p>The following theorem states that as long as the first <span class="v">k</span> elements of 
field 2 of two objects are equal, the non-primitive accessor <span class="v">sum-range-of-field2</span> of the two 
objects is preserved:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="STOBJS____RANGE-EQUAL.html">range-equal</a> 0 k (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> 2 new) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> 2 old))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (sum-range-of-field2 k new)
                (sum-range-of-field2 k old)))</pre> 
 
<p>The following theorem states that the non-primitive updater <span class="v">clear-field2-from</span> only 
affects elements k and above of field 2:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> (<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> i) (<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> k))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> i (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> 2 (clear-field2-from k x)))
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> i (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> 2 x))))</pre> 
 
<p>Given an appropriate reasoning strategy about <span class="v">range-equal</span> and the 
bind-free strategy below, these two rules are sufficient to prove:</p> 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3_D3.html">&lt;=</a> (<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> j) (<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> k))
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (sum-range-of-field2 j (clear-field2-from k x))
                (sum-range-of-field2 j x)))</pre> 
 
<h3>Free Variable Binding Strategy</h3> 
 
<p>Accessor theorems of the form above contain a free variable <span class="v">old</span>.  Our 
approaches use two strategies to bind this variable:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>When trying to prove another such accessor rule, we bind <span class="v">old</span> to 
<span class="v">old</span> whenever <span class="v">new</span> is bound to <span class="v">new</span> (and do not apply the rule 
otherwise).  This strategy is effective as long as all such accessor rules are 
phrased in terms of the same two variables.</li> 
 
<li>In other contexts, we only apply the rule when <span class="v">new</span> is a function call. 
In that case, we use the <span class="v">prev-stobj-binding</span> utility to bind <span class="v">old</span> to 
one of the actuals of that function call, depending on the formals and 
stobjs-out of the function in question.  For example, suppose <span class="v">foo</span> takes 
formals <span class="v">(x val st$)</span> and has stobjs-out <span class="v">(nil st$)</span>.  That is, 
it (perhaps) modifies <span class="v">st$</span> and returns it as its second value.  Then if 
<span class="v">new</span> is bound to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 1 (foo k q bar))</span>, we will find <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> 1
stobjs-out) = st$</span>, find that <span class="v">st$</span> is the 3rd formal, and thus bind the 
third actual, <span class="v">bar</span>, to <span class="v">old</span>.</li> 
 
</ul>
