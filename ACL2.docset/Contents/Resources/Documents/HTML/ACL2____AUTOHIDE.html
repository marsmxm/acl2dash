<p>Tell ACL2 to automatically <a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> some terms.</p><p>Autohide is a computed hint (see <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>) that scans 
your proof goals for any uses of certain functions, and instructs ACL2 to wrap 
these calls in <a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a>.  This can be used as a way to tell ACL2 to ignore 
certain irrelevant terms so that proofs can be completed faster.</p> 
 
<p>In particular, when I want to speed up a proof, I usually start by using 
<a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a> to see if there are expensive rules that do not 
seem to be necessary.  Often there are just a couple of expensive rules that 
can be disabled to achieve the bulk of the speedup.</p> 
 
<p>But sometimes the list of rules to disable can get pretty long.  Also, as 
the books you are relying upon are updated and extended with new rules, you 
might need to go back and additionally disable those rules to keep the proof 
fast.  These are cases where autohide may be useful.</p> 
 
<p>Instead of disabling specific rules, autohide tells ACL2 to wrap calls of 
certain functions in <a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a>, effectively telling the prover to ignore 
those terms.  If you know that, say, the <a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQUAL.html">member-equal</a> terms you are 
going to encounter are really irrelevant to what you're trying to prove, then 
you might just autohide <span class="v">member-equal</span> instead of trying to disable ten 
rules about it.</p> 
 
<h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "clause-processors/autohide" :dir :system)
(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____AUTOHIDE.html">autohide</a> member-equal subsep-equal))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> my-thm1 ...)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> my-thm2 ...)</pre> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____AUTOHIDE.html">autohide</a> fn1 fn2 ...)</span> macro expands to a <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> event and 
just records the names of the functions you want to autohide.</p> 
 
<p>Advice: always localize <span class="v">autohide</span> to avoid inadvertently hiding terms in 
other theorems.</p> 
 
<p>Note that <span class="v">autohide</span> is cumulative, so the above is equivalent to:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____AUTOHIDE.html">autohide</a> member-equal))
(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____AUTOHIDE.html">autohide</a> subsetp-equal))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> my-thm1 ...)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> my-thm2 ...)</pre> 
 
<h3>Additional Functions</h3> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(autohide-summary)</span> will tell you which functions are currently 
     being automatically hidden;</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(autohide-delete fn1 fn2)</span> will remove specific functions from 
     the autohide table.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(autohide-clear)</span> will clear the table, basically turning off 
     autohiding.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>The autohide hint makes use of a verified <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>.  If you 
need finer-grained control, e.g., you want to autohide certain functions only 
in specific subgoals, you may wish to disable the autohide hint and manually 
use the clause processor.</p>
