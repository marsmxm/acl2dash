<p>Java floating-point operations [JLS:4.2.4].</p><p>Here we provide abstract notions for 
     all the unary and binary operations on floating-point values 
     that are not conversions (those are formalized separately).</p><p>[JLS:4.2.4] also lists the prefix and posfix <span class="v">++</span> and <span class="v">--</span> operators, 
     but those operate on variables, not just values, 
     and therefore must be formalized elsewhere.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.4] also lists the conditional operator <span class="v">? :</span>, 
     but that one is non-strict, 
     and therefore must be formalized as part of expression evaluation.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.4] also lists the string concatenation operator <span class="v">+</span>, 
     but that is best formalized in terms of integral-to-string conversions, 
     elsewhere.</p><p>[JLS:4.2.4] also lists the cast operator, which involves conversions, 
     which, as mentioned above, are formalized separately.</p>
