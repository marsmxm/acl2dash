<p>Display prover key checkpoint information.</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-LIST.html">checkpoint-list</a> for relevant background.  Evaluation of 
 the macro call <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SHOW-CHECKPOINT-LIST.html">show-checkpoint-list</a>)</span> prints checkpoint clauses (as 
 returned by <span class="v">checkpoint-list</span>) as well as related information.  An optional 
 argument has default <span class="v">nil</span>; when it is not <span class="v">nil</span>, then the checkpoints 
 are printed as untranslated terms, as described in the documentation for 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-LIST-PRETTY.html">checkpoint-list-pretty</a></span>.  Whether printed as a clause or as an 
 untranslated term, each checkpoint is printed with its <a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a>, i.e., 
 the user-friendly goal name that one sees in prover output for a <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-IDENTIFIER.html">clause-identifier</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Also shown are whether or not at least one goal was <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>d during 
 the failed proof and whether the proof was aborted, and (briefly) why.</p>
