<p>A reference to some part of something that is somewhere in the 
             design.  Could be a simple wire name like <span class="v">foo</span>, or something 
             much fancier with scoping, hierarchy, indexing, and part-selects 
             like <span class="v">ape::bat::cat.dog[3][2][1].elf[6][5][10:0]</span>.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>scope — <a href="VL____VL-SCOPEEXPR.html">vl-scopeexpr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Captures the scoping that leads to some object in the 
                design. This captures the <span class="v">ape::bat::cat.dog[3][2][1].elf</span> 
                part of the example above.</dd> 
 
<dt>indices — <a href="VL____VL-EXPRLIST.html">vl-exprlist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Captures any subsequent indexing once we get to the thing 
                pointed to by <span class="v">scope</span>.  This captures the <span class="v">[6][5]</span> part 
                of the example above.</dd> 
 
<dt>part — <a href="VL____VL-PARTSELECT.html">vl-partselect</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Captures any subsequent part-selection once we get past all of 
                the indexing.  This captures the <span class="v">[10:0]</span> part of the 
                example above.</dd> 
 
<dt>atts — <a href="VL____VL-ATTS.html">vl-atts</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Any associated attributes.  BOZO where would you put such 
                attributes?</dd> 
 
</dl><p>SystemVerilog provides a very rich syntax for referring to things 
           in different scopes and throughout the module hierarchy.  Any such 
           reference—whether it is a very simple identifier like <span class="v">foo</span> 
           or a very complex scoped, hierarchical, indexed, mess of 
           indirection—is ultimately represented as a single 
           <span class="v">vl-index</span> expression.</p>
