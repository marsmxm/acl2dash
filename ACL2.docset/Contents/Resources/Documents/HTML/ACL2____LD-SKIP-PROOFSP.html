<p>How carefully ACL2 processes your <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s</p><pre class="code">Examples:
ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____SET-LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">set-ld-skip-proofsp</a> t state)
 T
ACL2 !s&gt;(<a href="ACL2____SET-LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">set-ld-skip-proofsp</a> nil state)
 NIL
ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____SET-LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">set-ld-skip-proofsp</a> 'include-book state)
 INCLUDE-BOOK
ACL2 !s&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>A global variable in the ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>, called <span class="v">'ld-skip-proofsp</span>, 
 determines the thoroughness with which ACL2 processes your <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s. 
 This variable may take on one of three values: <span class="v">t</span>, <span class="v">nil</span> or 
 <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  When <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>, the 
 system assumes that which ought to be proved and is thus unsound.  The form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">set-ld-skip-proofsp</a> flg state)</span> is the general-purpose way of setting 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span>.  This global variable is an ``<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> special,'' 
 which is to say, you may call <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> in such a way as to ``bind'' this 
 variable for the dynamic extent of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>, the default <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a> 
 displays the character <span class="v">s</span>.  Thus, the <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a></p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !s&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>means that the default <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> (otherwise 
 the character <span class="v">p</span>, for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span>, would also be printed; see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-PRINT-PROMPT.html">default-print-prompt</a>) but ``proofs are being skipped.''</p> 
 
 <p>Observe that there are two legal non-<span class="v">nil</span> values, <span class="v">t</span> and 
 <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  When <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, ACL2 skips 
 all proof obligations but otherwise performs all other required analysis of 
 input <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  When <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, 
 ACL2 skips not only proof obligations but all analysis except that required to 
 compute the effect of successfully executed <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  To explain the 
 distinction, let us consider one particular event, say a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.  Very 
 roughly speaking, a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> event normally involves a check of the 
 syntactic well-formedness of the submitted definition, the generation and 
 proof of the termination conditions, and the computation and storage of 
 various rules such as a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> rule and some <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules.  By ``normally'' above we mean when 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.  How does a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> behave when 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>?</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, then <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> performs the 
 syntactic well-formedness checks and computes and stores the various rules, 
 but it does not actually carry out the termination proofs.  If 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> does not do 
 the syntactic well-formedness check nor does it carry out the termination 
 proof.  Instead, it merely computes and stores the rules under the assumption 
 that the checks and proofs would all succeed.  Observe that a setting of 
 <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> is ``stronger'' than a setting of <span class="v">t</span> in the 
 sense that <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> causes <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> to assume even more 
 about the admissibility of the event than <span class="v">t</span> does.</p> 
 
 <p>As one might infer from the choice of name, the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event 
 sets <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> to <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> when processing the 
 <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in a book being loaded.  Thus, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> does the 
 minimal work necessary to carry out the effects of every event in the book. 
 The syntactic checks and proof obligations were, presumably, successfully 
 carried out when the book was certified.</p> 
 
 <p>A non-<span class="v">nil</span> value for <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> also affects the system's 
 output messages.  Event summaries (the paragraphs that begin ``<a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">Summary</a>'' and display the event forms, rules used, etc.) are not printed when 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is non-<span class="v">nil</span>.  Warnings and observations are printed 
 when <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is <span class="v">t</span> but are not printed when it is 
 <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Intuitively, <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> <span class="v">t</span> means skip just the proofs and 
 otherwise do all the work normally required for an event; while 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> is ``stronger'' and means do 
 as little as possible to process <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  In accordance with this 
 intuition, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> are processed when <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> 
 is <span class="v">t</span> but are skipped when <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 system itself uses only two settings, <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, the latter being used only when executing the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> 
 inside of a book being included.  The <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> setting of <span class="v">t</span> 
 is provided as a convenience to the user.  For example, suppose one has a file 
 of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  By loading it with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> with <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> set 
 to <span class="v">t</span>, the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> can all be checked for syntactic correctness and 
 assumed without proof.  This is a convenient way to recover a state lost by a 
 system crash or to experiment with a modification of an <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> 
 file.</p> 
 
 <p>The foregoing discussion is actually based on a lie.  <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> 
 is allowed two other values, <span class="v">'initialize-acl2</span> and 
 <span class="v">'include-book-with-locals</span>.  The first causes behavior similar to <span class="v">t</span> 
 but skips <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> and avoids some error checks that would 
 otherwise prevent ACL2 from properly booting.  The second is identical to 
 <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> but also executes <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>. 
 These additional values are not intended for use by the user, but no barriers 
 to their use have been erected.</p> 
 
 <p>User-defined tools may temporarily modify the global setting of 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span>; for example, see <a href="ACL2____REMOVE-HYPS.html">remove-hyps</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We close by reminding the user that ACL2 is potentially unsound if 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is set by the user.  Indeed, direct setting of 
 <span class="v">ld-skip-proofsp</span> is illegal within a book (except during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> expansion).  We provide access to it simply to allow 
 experimentation and rapid reconstruction of lost or modified logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s.</p>
