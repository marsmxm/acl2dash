<p>How to create, certify, and use a simple book</p><p>Suppose you have developed a sequence of admissible <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> 
 which you want to turn into a book.  We call this ``publishing'' the book. 
 This note explains how to do that.</p> 
 
 <p>A key idea of <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> is that they are ``incremental'' in the sense 
 that when you include a book in a host logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> 
 is incrementally extended by the results established in that book.  This is 
 allowed only if every name defined by the incoming book is either new or is 
 already identically defined.  See <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>.  This is exactly 
 the same problem faced by a programmer who wishes to provide a utility to 
 other people: how can he make sure he doesn't create name conflicts?  The 
 solution, in Common Lisp, is also the same: use packages.  While <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> 
 and packages have a very tenuous formal connection (every book must start with 
 an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></span>), the creation of a book is intimately concerned with 
 the package issue.  Having motivated what would otherwise appear as an 
 unnecessary fascination with packages below, we now proceed with a description 
 of how to publish a book.</p> 
 
 <p>Just to be concrete, let's suppose you have already gotten ACL2 to accept 
 the following sequence of <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s, starting in the ACL2 initial <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "ACL2-MY-BOOK"
        (<a href="ACL2____UNION-EQ.html">union-eq</a> *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*
                  *acl2-exports*))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2-MY-BOOK")
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> app (x y)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) (app (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x) y)) y))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> rev (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (app (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))) nil))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> rev-app-hack
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (app a (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> a))))
(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> rev-rev
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">acl2::true-listp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x)) x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Observe that the first form above defines a package (which imports the 
 symbols defined in CLTL such as <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span> and the symbols 
 used to <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> ACL2 such as <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>).  The 
 second form selects that package as the current one.  All subsequent forms are 
 read into that package.  The remaining forms are just event forms: <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>s and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>s in this case.</p> 
 
 <p>Typically you would have created a file with Emacs containing these forms 
 and you will have submitted each of them interactively to ACL2 to confirm that 
 they are all admissible.  That interactive verification should start in ACL2's 
 initial <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>  although you might, of course, start your 
 sequence of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> with some <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>s to build a more 
 elaborate <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The first step towards publishing a book containing the results above is to 
 create a file that starts with the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a></span> and then contains the 
 rest of the forms.  Let's call that file <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span>.  The name is 
 unimportant, except it must end with <span class="v">".lisp"</span>.  If there are <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> that you do not wish to be available to the user of the book  
 e.g., lemmas you proved on your way toward proving the main ones  you 
 may so mark them by enclosing them in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> forms.  See <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a>. 
 Let us suppose you wish to hide <span class="v">rev-app-hack</span> above.  You may also add 
 standard Lisp comments to the file.  The final content of 
 <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span> might be:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; This book contains my app and rev functions and the theorem
; that rev is its own inverse.

  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IN-PACKAGE.html">in-package</a> "ACL2-MY-BOOK")
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> app (x y)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) (app (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x) y)) y))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> rev (x)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (app (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))) nil))

; The following hack is not exported.
  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> rev-app-hack
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (app a (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> a)))))

  (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> rev-rev
    (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">acl2::true-listp</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x)) x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The file shown above <b>is</b> the book.  By the time this note is done you 
 will have seen how to certify that the book is correct, how to compile it, and 
 how to use it in other host <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>s.  Observe that the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> is 
 not in the book.  It cannot be: Common Lisp compilers disagree on how to treat 
 new package definitions appearing in files to be compiled.</p> 
 
 <p>Since a book is just a source file typed by the user, ACL2 provides a 
 mechanism for checking that the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> are all admissible and then 
 marking the file as checked.  This is called certification.  To certify 
 <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span> you should first get into ACL2 with an initial <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  Then, define the package needed by the book, by typing the following 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> to the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____PROMPT.html">prompt</a>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a> "ACL2-MY-BOOK"
               (<a href="ACL2____UNION-EQ.html">union-eq</a> *common-lisp-symbols-from-main-lisp-package*
                         *acl2-exports*))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then execute the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> "my-book" 1 t) ; the `t' is in fact the default</pre> 
 
 <p>Observe that you do not type the <span class="v">".lisp"</span> part of the file name.  For 
 purposes of <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>, the book's name is <span class="v">"my-book"</span> and by the time 
 all is said and done, there will be several extensions in addition to the 
 <span class="v">".lisp"</span> extension associated with it.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">1</span> tells <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> that you acknowledge that there is 
 one command in this ``certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>'' (namely the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>).  To use the book, any prospective host <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> must be extended 
 by the addition of whatever <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s occurred before certification.  It 
 would be a pity to certify a book in a <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> containing junk because 
 that junk will become the ``<a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>'' guarding entrance to the book. 
 The <span class="v">t</span> above tells <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> that you wish to compile 
 <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span> also (but see <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> for an exception). 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></span> makes many checks but by far the most important and 
 time-consuming one is that it ``proves'' every event in the file.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> is done it will have created two new files.  The 
 first will be called <span class="v">"my-book.cert"</span> and contains the ``<a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>'' attesting to the admissibility of the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in 
 <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span>.  The <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> contains the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> and 
 any other forms necessary to construct the certification <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  It 
 also contains so-called <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> values that are used to help you keep 
 track of which version of <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span> was certified.</p> 
 
 <p>The second file that may be created by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> is the compiled 
 version of <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span> and will have a name that is assigned by the 
 host compiler (e.g., <span class="v">"my-book.o"</span> in GCL, <span class="v">"my-book.fasl"</span> in 
 SBCL).  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">Certify-book</a></span> will also load this object file.  When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> is done, you may throw away the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> it created, 
 for example by executing the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> <span class="v">:u</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>To use the book later in any ACL2 session, just execute the event 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "my-book")</span>.  This will do the necessary <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>, 
 load the non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span> and then may 
 load the compiled code for the non-local functions defined in that file. 
 Checks are made to ensure that the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> file exists and 
 describes the version of <span class="v">"my-book.lisp"</span> that is read.  The compiled 
 code is loaded if and only if it exists and has a later write date than the 
 source file (but see <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> for an exception).</p> 
 
 <p>Since <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> is itself an event, you may put such forms into 
 other <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  Thus it is possible for the inclusion of a single book to 
 lead to the inclusion of many others.  The <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> information 
 maintained in <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>s helps deal with the version control problem 
 of the referenced <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  I.e., if this version of <span class="v">"my-book"</span> is 
 used during the certification of <span class="v">"your-book"</span>, then the <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for <span class="v">"your-book"</span> includes the book-hash for this version of 
 <span class="v">"my-book"</span>.  If a later <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "your-book")</span> finds a 
 version of <span class="v">"my-book"</span> with a different book-hash, an error is signaled. 
 But book-hash values are not perfect and the insecurity of the host file 
 system prevents ACL2 from guaranteeing the logical soundness of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event, even for a book that appears to have a valid <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> (they can be forged, after all).  (See <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> for 
 further discussion.)</p> 
 
 <p>This concludes the example of how to create, certify and use a book.  If 
 you wish, you could now review the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> for book-related 
 topics (see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>) and browse through them.  They'll probably make 
 sense in this context.  Alternatively, you could continue the ``guided tour'' 
 through the rest of the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> of <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  See <a href="ACL2____BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a>, following the pointer given at the conclusion.</p>
