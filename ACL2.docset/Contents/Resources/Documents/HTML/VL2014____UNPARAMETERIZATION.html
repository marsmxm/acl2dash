<p>Expand away modules with parameters; similar to the idea of 
<i>elaboration</i> of the design.</p><p>Unparameterization is a Verilog transformation which, given a set 
of Verilog modules, is supposed to produce an equivalent, parameter-free set of 
modules.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Background on Parameters</h3> 
 
<p>See <a href="VL2014____VL-PARAMTYPE.html">vl-paramtype</a> and <a href="VL2014____VL-PARAMDECL.html">vl-paramdecl</a> for background on our 
representation of parameter declarations.  Parameters can be declared as either 
ordinary <span class="v">parameter</span>s or as <span class="v">localparam</span>s.  Parameters may have default 
values, and their defaults can refer to other parameters in the module.  Some 
simple examples of parameters are:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module m (a, b, c) ;
  ...
  parameter size = 4 ;
  localparam twosize = 2 * size ;
  ...
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Such a module can be instantiated in various ways, e.g.,:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">module uses_m (x y z) ;
  ...
  m #(6)        m_instance_1 (.a(x), .b(y), .c(z)) ; // size 6
  m #(.size(6)) m_instance_2 (.a(x), .b(y), .c(z)) ; // size 6
  m             m_instance_3 (.a(x), .b(y), .c(z)) ; // size 4
  ...
endmodule</pre> 
 
<p>Local parameters are just like parameters except that they cannot be 
assigned to from outside the module.  They seem like about the cleanest way to 
introduce named constants, as unlike <span class="v">`define</span> they don't pollute the global 
namespace.</p> 
 
<p>Parameters can also be given values via the <span class="v">defparam</span> statement, but 
this construct is being deprecated (see SystemVerilog-2012 section C.4.1) and 
may be removed from future versions of the language.  We generally think that 
using <span class="v">defparam</span> is bad form.  VL does not support <span class="v">defparam</span>, so we do 
not consider it here.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Unparameterization</h3> 
 
<p>The basic idea behind unparameterization is pretty simple.</p> 
 
<p>Suppose we are dealing with a parameterized module called <span class="v">plus</span>, which 
takes a single parameter called <span class="v">size</span>.  There may be several modules, say 
<span class="v">m1</span>, <span class="v">m2</span>, and <span class="v">m3</span>, which contain instances of <span class="v">plus</span> with 
different sizes, say <span class="v">8</span>, <span class="v">16</span>, and <span class="v">32</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Our general goal is to eliminate <span class="v">plus</span> from our module list by replacing 
it with three new modules, <span class="v">plus$size=8</span>, <span class="v">plus$size=16</span>, and 
<span class="v">plus$size=32</span>, which are copies of <span class="v">plus</span> except that <span class="v">size</span> has been 
replaced everywhere with <span class="v">8</span>, <span class="v">16</span>, or <span class="v">32</span> as suggested by their 
names.</p> 
 
<p>At the same time, we need to change the instances of <span class="v">plus</span> throughout 
<span class="v">m1</span>, <span class="v">m2</span>, and <span class="v">m3</span> with appropriate instances of the new modules. 
Finally, once all of the instances of the generic <span class="v">plus</span> have been done away 
with, we can safely remove <span class="v">plus</span> from our module list.</p>
