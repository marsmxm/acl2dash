<p>Warn about comparisons involving arithmetic operators.</p><p>This is a heuristic for generating warnings.</p> 
 
<p>Often an expression like <span class="v">a + b &gt;= c</span> conceals a bug where the size of 
<span class="v">a + b</span> isn't big enough to represent all its possible values.  Instead of 
doing something smarter, we just warn about all occurrences of comparisons 
where one side is a plus, minus, multiply, or divide expression.</p>
