<p>ACL2 Version  2.8 Notes on System-level Changes</p><p>ACL2 now runs on OpenMCL, ``an opensourced Common Lisp 
 implementation, derived from Digitool's Macintosh Common Lisp product.'' 
 Thanks to Greg Wright and Robert Krug for doing most of the work for this 
 port.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">(</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span><span class="v">)</span> is first executed, the underlying raw Lisp 
 package will change to <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> (if that is not already the current 
 package in raw Lisp).  This is a minor change that will probably not be 
 noticed, since up to now it has probably been the case that the ACL2 
 executable starts up with <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> as the underlying raw Lisp package. 
 But this change was made because we have been informed that ACL2 executables 
 based on OpenMCL need not start up with <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> as the underlying raw 
 Lisp package.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 now runs on MCL 5.0.  Thanks to Pascal Costanza for updates to the 
 instructions in file <span class="v">mcl-acl2-startup.lisp</span> and for an update to the ACL2 
 sources (parameter <span class="v">*compiled-file-extension*</span>).</p>
