 <p>The structure of this documentation is as follows.  First we give a brief 
 overview of forward chaining and contrast it to backchaining (rewriting). 
 Then we lay out the syntactic restrictions on <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> rules. 
 Then we give more details about the process and point to a tool to assist you 
 in debugging your <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> rules.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Overview and When to Use Forward Chaining</i></p> 
 
 <p>Forward chaining is performed as part of the simplification process: before 
 the goal is rewritten a <i>context</i> is established.  The context tells the 
 theorem prover what may be assumed during rewriting, in particular, to 
 establish hypotheses of rewrite rules.  Forward chaining is used to extend the 
 context before rewriting begins.  For example, the <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> rule 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p x) (p1 x))</span> would add <span class="v">(p1 A)</span> to the context, where <span class="v">A</span> 
 is some term, if <span class="v">(p A)</span> is already in the context.</p> 
 
 <p>Forward chaining and backchaining are duals.  If a rewrite rule requires 
 that <span class="v">(p1 A)</span> be established and <span class="v">(p A)</span> is known, it could be done 
 either by making <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p x) (p1 x))</span> a <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> rule or 
 a <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule.  Which should you choose?</p> 
 
 <p>As a rule of thumb, if a conclusion like <span class="v">(p1 A)</span> is expected to be 
 widely needed, it is better to derive it via forward chaining because then it 
 is available ``for free'' during the rewriting after paying the one-time cost 
 of forward chaining.  Alternatively, if <span class="v">(p1 A)</span> is a rather special 
 hypothesis of key importance to only a few rewrite rules, it is best to derive 
 it only when needed through backchaining.  Thus forward chaining is pro-active 
 and backward chaining (rewriting) is reactive.</p> 
 
 <p>The following example illustrates that forward chaining may be 
 indispensable in a scenario with <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>, whose handling is 
 quite weak with rewrite rules.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p0 (x) t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p1 (x) t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p2 (y) t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> p0-implies-p1
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p0 x)
           (p1 x))
  :rule-classes :forward-chaining)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> p1-implies-p2
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p1 x)
           (p2 y)))
; ACL2 proves the following, but only because p0-implies-p1 is a
; :forward-chaining rule.  If p0-implies-p1 is instead a :rewrite
; rule, then the proof fails for the following event.
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p0 x)
              (p2 y)))</pre> 
 
 <p><i>Syntactic Restrictions</i></p> 
 
 <p>Forward chaining rules are generated from the corollary term (see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>) as follows.  First, every <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> expression is expanded 
 away (hence, so is every <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span> expression), and 
 trivial ``guard holders'' are removed; see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-HOLDERS.html">guard-holders</a>.  If the 
 resulting term has the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> hyp concl)</span>, then <span class="v">concl</span> is 
 treated as a conjunction, with one forward chaining rule with hypothesis 
 <span class="v">hyp</span> created for each conjunct.  In the other case, where the corollary 
 term is not an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a></span>, we process it as we process the conclusion in 
 the first case.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that unlike rewrite rules, a nested implication is not folded into a 
 single implication.  Consider for example the following term.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p1 x)
         (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p2 x)
                  (p3 x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Although this term is parsed for a rewrite rule as <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p1 x)
 (p2 x)) (p3 x))</span>, that is not the case when this term is parsed for a 
 forward-chaining rule, in which case <span class="v">(p1 x)</span> is treated as the hypothesis 
 and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p2 x) (p3 x))</span> is treated as the conclusion.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:trigger-terms</span> field of a <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> rule class object 
 should be a non-empty list of terms, if provided, and should have certain 
 properties described below.  If the <span class="v">:trigger-terms</span> field is not provided, 
 it defaults to the singleton list containing the ``atom'' of the first 
 hypothesis of the formula.  (The atom of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> x)</span> is <span class="v">x</span>; the atom of 
 any other term is the term itself.)  If there are no hypotheses and no 
 <span class="v">:trigger-terms</span> were provided, an error is caused.</p> 
 
 <p>A triggering term is acceptable if it is not a variable, a quoted constant, 
 a lambda application, a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>- (or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a></span>-) expression, or a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a></span>-expression, and every variable symbol in the conclusion of the 
 theorem either occurs in the hypotheses or occurs in the trigger.</p> 
 
 <p><i>More Details about Forward Chaining</i></p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:Forward-chaining</span> rules are used by the simplifier <i>before</i> it 
 begins to rewrite the literals of the goal.  (Forward chaining is thus carried 
 out from scratch for each goal.)  If any term in the goal is an instance of a 
 trigger of some forward chaining rule, we try to establish the hypotheses of 
 that forward chaining theorem (from the negation of the goal).  To relieve a 
 hypothesis we only use type reasoning, evaluation of ground terms, and 
 presence among our known assumptions.  We do not use rewriting.  So-called 
 free variables in hypotheses are treated specially; see <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a>. 
 If all hypotheses are relieved, and certain heuristics approve of the newly 
 derived conclusion, we add the instantiated conclusion to our known 
 assumptions.  Since this might introduce new terms into the assumptions, 
 forward chaining is repeated.  Heuristic approval of each new addition is 
 necessary to avoid infinite looping as would happen with the rule <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a>
 (p x) (p (f x)))</span>, which might otherwise forward chain from <span class="v">(p A)</span> to 
 <span class="v">(p (f A))</span> to <span class="v">(p (f (f A)))</span>, etc.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Caution</i>.  Forward chaining does not actually add terms to the goals 
 displayed during proof attempts.  Instead, it extends an associated 
 <i>context</i>, called ``assumptions'' in the preceding paragraph, that ACL2 
 builds from the goal currently being proved.  (For insiders: forward chaining 
 extends the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-ALIST.html">type-alist</a></span>.)  The context starts out with ``obvious'' 
 consequences of the negation of the goal.  For example, if the goal is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (p A) (<a href="ACL2____Q.html">q</a> (f A)))
         (c A))</pre> 
 
 <p>then the context notes that <span class="v">(p A)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____Q.html">q</a> (f A))</span> are non-<span class="v">nil</span> 
 and <span class="v">(c A)</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.  Forward chaining is then used to expand the 
 context.  For example, if a forward chaining rule has <span class="v">(f x)</span> as a trigger 
 term and has body <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p x) (r (f x)))</span>, then the context is extended 
 by binding <span class="v">(r (f A))</span> to non-<span class="v">nil</span>, provided the heuristics approve of 
 this extension.  Note however that since <span class="v">(r (f A))</span> is put into the 
 context, not the goal, you will not see it in the goal formula.  Furthermore, 
 the assumption added to the context is just the instantiation of the 
 conclusion of the rule, with no simplification or rewriting applied.  Thus, 
 for example, if it contains an enabled non-recursive function symbol it is 
 unlikely ever to match a (rewritten) term arising during subsequent 
 simplification of the goal.</p> 
 
 <p>However, forward-chaining does support the linear arithmetic reasoning 
 package.  For example, suppose that forward-chaining puts <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> (f x) (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x))</span> 
 into the context.  Then this inequality also goes into the linear arithmetic 
 database, together with suitable instances of linear lemmas whose trigger term 
 is a call of <span class="v">g</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Debugging <span class="v">:forward-chaining</span> rules can be difficult since their effects 
 are not directly visible on the goal being simplified.  Tools are available to 
 help you discover what forward chaining has occurred see <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING-REPORTS.html">forward-chaining-reports</a>.</p>
