<p>Allow more than one initial subgoal to be pushed for induction</p><p>The value of this flag is normally <span class="v">nil</span>.  If you want to 
 prevent the theorem prover from abandoning its initial work upon pushing the 
 second subgoal, set <span class="v">:otf-flg</span> to <span class="v">t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose you submit a conjecture to the theorem prover and the system splits 
 it up into many subgoals.  Any subgoal not proved by other methods is 
 eventually set aside for an attempted induction proof.  But upon setting aside 
 the second such subgoal, the system chickens out and decides that rather than 
 prove n&gt;1 subgoals inductively, it will abandon its initial work and 
 attempt induction on the originally submitted conjecture.  The <span class="v">:otf-flg</span> 
 (Onward Thru the Fog) allows you to override this chickening out. When 
 <span class="v">:otf-flg</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, the system will push all the initial subgoals and 
 proceed to try to prove each, independently, by induction.</p> 
 
 <p>Even when you don't expect induction to be used or to succeed, setting the 
 <span class="v">:otf-flg</span> is a good way to force the system to generate and display all 
 the initial subgoals.</p> 
 
 <p>For <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span>, <span class="v">:otf-flg</span> is a keyword argument 
 that is a peer to <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a></span>.  It may 
 be supplied as in the following examples; also see <a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (my-predicate x y) :rule-classes nil :otf-flg t)

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> append-assoc
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y) z)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> y z)))
  :hints (("Goal" :induct t))
  :otf-flg t)</pre> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:otf-flg</span> may be supplied to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> via the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a></span> 
 declare option.  When you supply an <span class="v">:otf-flg</span> hint to <span class="v">defun</span>, the flag 
 is effective for the termination proofs and the guard proofs, if any.</p>
