<p>The VL server powers the Module Browser, a web-based interface for 
viewing Verilog designs.</p><h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
<p>The VL Server lets you to browser through a Verilog or SystemVerilog design 
from a web browser.  Some nice features:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>Easily jump from module to module via hyperlinks</li> 
 <li>Click on wires to see how they're used</li> 
 <li>Get pictures (that you can print) of a module's inputs and outputs</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The VL server is normally built as part of the VL <a href="VL____KIT.html">kit</a>.  That is, to 
start the server you can run <span class="v">vl server [options]</span>, where <span class="v">vl</span> is the VL 
command-line program described in <a href="VL____KIT.html">kit</a>.</p> 
 
<h5>Security Warning</h5> 
 
<p>The server has NO AUTHENTICATION MECHANISM.  Anyone who can see your machine 
on the network can browse your Verilog modules.  Moreover, the module browser 
software MAY HAVE SECURITY VULNERABILITIES that could allow an attacker to gain 
access to your computer.  You should ONLY run the module browser after first 
consulting your network administrator to ensure that appropriate firewalls are 
in place.  You should NEVER run the module browser on an untrusted 
network (e.g., the internet).  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT 
HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN 
ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION 
WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Getting Started</h3> 
 
<div class="box"><p>See <span class="v">demo.sh</span> in <span class="v">acl2/books/centaur/vl/kit/server-demo</span> for 
an interactive demo of the following commands.</p></div> 
 
<p>The server reads Verilog designs from <span class="v">.vlzip</span> files that are produced by 
the <a href="VL____VL-ZIP.html">vl-zip</a> command.  So, the first step to use the VL Server is to use 
VL to zip up your designs using a command such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">vl zip foo.sv 
   --search ./lib1 
   --search ./lib2 
   --name foo 
   --output=./translations/foo.vlzip</pre> 
 
<p>You can see <a href="VL____VL-ZIP.html">vl-zip</a> for more details.  Once your <span class="v">.vlzip</span> files 
have been generated, you can point the VL server to the directory that contains 
them, using a command such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">vl server --port 3375 --root=./translations</pre> 
 
<p>Once the server is running, you should be able to connect your web browser 
to it by entering a URL such as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">http://localhost:3375/</pre> 
 
<p>The server will occasionally rescan its <span class="v">--root</span> directory for new 
<span class="v">.vlzip</span> files, and you can choose the file you want to browse from the main 
page.</p> 
 
 
<h5>Other Options</h5> 
 
<p>For detailed usage information, you can run <span class="v">vl server --help</span> or see 
<a href="VL_____A2VL-SERVER-HELP_A2.html">*vl-server-help*</a>.</p>
