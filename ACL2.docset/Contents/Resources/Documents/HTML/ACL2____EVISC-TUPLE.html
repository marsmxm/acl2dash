<p>Control suppression of details when printing</p><p>ACL2 output is generally printed in full.  However, ACL2 can be 
 directed to abbreviate, or ``eviscerate'', objects before printing them.  To 
 ``eviscerate'' an object we replace certain substructures within it by strings 
 that are printed in their stead.  Such replacement is made relative to a 
 so-called ``evisc-tuple'', which has four components: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a>
 print-level print-length alist hiding-cars)</span> is the same as the value of 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> alist print-level print-length hiding-cars)</span>, and the components are 
 used as follows (with priority order as discussed below).  The <span class="v">alist</span> 
 component is used to replace any substructure occurring as a key by the 
 corresponding string.  The <span class="v">print-level</span> and <span class="v">print-length</span> are 
 analogous to Common Lisp variables <span class="v">*print-level*</span> and <span class="v">*print-length*</span>, 
 respectively, and cause replacement of substructures deeper than 
 <span class="v">print-level</span> by `<span class="v">#</span>' and those longer than <span class="v">print-length</span> by 
 `<span class="v">...</span>'.  Finally, any <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a></span> <span class="v">x</span> that starts with one of the 
 symbols in <span class="v">hiding-cars</span> is printed as <span class="v">&lt;hidden&gt;</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The following example illustrates the use of an evisc-tuple that limits the 
 print-level to 3 — only three descents into list structures are 
 permitted before replacing a subexpression by `<span class="v">#</span>' — and limits the 
 print-length to 4 — only the first four elements of any list structure 
 will be printed before replacing its tail by `<span class="v">...</span>'.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a> "~x0~%"
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> #\0 '((a b ((c d)) e f g) u v w x y)))
            *standard-co*
            state
            (<a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a> 3 4 nil nil))

((A B (#) E ...) U V W ...)
&lt;state&gt;
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Notice that it is impossible to read the printed value back into ACL2, 
 since there is no way for the ACL2 reader to interpret `<span class="v">#</span>' or `<span class="v">...</span>'. 
 To solve this problem, see <a href="ACL2____SET-IPRINT.html">set-iprint</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>In the above example we pass an evisc-tuple explicitly to a printing 
 function, in this case, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMS.html">fms</a></span> (see <a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a>).  But ACL2 also does its 
 own printing, for example during a proof attempt.  There are global 
 evisc-tuples that control ACL2's printing; see <a href="ACL2____SET-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-evisc-tuple</a> and see 
 <a href="ACL2____WITHOUT-EVISC.html">without-evisc</a>.</p>
