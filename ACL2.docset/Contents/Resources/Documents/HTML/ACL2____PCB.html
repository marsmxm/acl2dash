<p>Print the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> block described by a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> descriptor</p><pre class="code">Examples:
:pcb :max ; print the most recent command block
:pcb :x   ; print the most recent command block
:pcb fn   ; print the command block that introduced fn
:pcb 5    ; print the fifth command block</pre> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Pcb</span> takes one argument, a <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a>, and prints in an 
 abbreviated format the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> block of the command described.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a> for description of the format in which <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s are 
 displayed.  The command block of a command consists of the command itself and 
 all of the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> it created.  If the command created a single event 
 and that event is in fact the command (i.e., if the command typed was just an 
 event such as a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> rather than a macro that 
 expanded to some event forms), then <span class="v">pcb</span> just prints the command (unless 
 the event is replaced using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXTEND-PE-TABLE.html">extend-pe-table</a></span>).  <span class="v">Pcb</span> sketches the 
 command and all of the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> it created, rather than printing them 
 fully.  If you wish to see just the command, in its entirety, use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a></span>. 
 If you wish to see one of the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> within the block, in its entirety, 
 use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span>.  If you wish to see the command sketched and all of the events 
 it created, in their entirety, use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PCB_12.html">pcb!</a></span>.  For a sequence of commands, 
 see <a href="ACL2____PCS.html">pcs</a> and <a href="ACL2____GCS.html">gcs</a>.</p>
