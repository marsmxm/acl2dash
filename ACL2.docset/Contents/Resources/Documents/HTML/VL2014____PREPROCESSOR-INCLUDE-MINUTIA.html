<p>Subtle notes about <span class="v">`include</span> handling.</p><p>The Verilog spec is very vague about how <span class="v">include</span> directives 
are to be processed.</p> 
 
<p>It does nicely explain that we are to simply replace the <span class="v">`include
"foo.v"</span> directive with the entire contents of <span class="v">foo.b</span>, and explains some 
things related to the syntax of the directive.  It also says that the included 
file can itself contain <span class="v">include</span> directives, which of course seems 
perfectly reasonable.</p> 
 
<p>The spec explicitly says the filename can be an absolute or relative 
pathname.  In the case of an absolute pathname, the intention seems pretty 
clear.</p> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, the spec does <b>not</b> explain anything about what a 
relative path is relative to.  Upon reading the spec, I thought, "well, 
<i>obviously</i> it means relative to whatever file is currently being 
processed." But it turns out that this is not at all how Verilog-XL and 
NCVerilog handle things.</p> 
 
<p>Instead, both of these tools include a notion of <i>include directories</i>. 
These directories are similar to, but distinct from, the <i>library 
directories</i> which are used to load "missing" modules.  These directories 
are configured with command-line options like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">+incdir+/home/jared/dir1 +incdir+/home/jared/dir2 ...</pre> 
 
<p>When these tools see <span class="v">`include "foo.v"</span>, they seem to search for 
<span class="v">foo.v</span> in these include directories, and include the first file that is 
found.</p> 
 
<p>Because of this, it does <i>not</i> work to just try to write includes 
relative to whatever file is being loaded, you just always write them relative 
to whatever the include path is going to be.</p>
