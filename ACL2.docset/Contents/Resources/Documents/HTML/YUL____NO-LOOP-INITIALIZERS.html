<p>The condition in which loop initialization blocks are empty.</p><p>The <span class="v">ForLoopInitRewriter</span> transformation 
     moves the statements in each loop's initialization block 
     just before the loop. 
     This makes all the loop initialization blocks empty. 
     Here we formalize this condition, 
     which is needed to prove the correctness of certain transformations.</p>
