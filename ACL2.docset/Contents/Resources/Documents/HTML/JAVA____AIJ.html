<p>AIJ (<b>A</b>CL2 <b>I</b>n <b>J</b>ava) 
          is a deep embedding of ACL2 in Java.</p><p>AIJ is a deep embedding in Java 
     of an executable, side-effect-free, non-stobj-accessing 
     subset of the ACL2 language without guards.</p><p>AIJ is realized as a Java package that includes 
     Java representations of all the ACL2 values, 
     Java implementations of all the ACL2 primitive functions, 
     and an interpreter that evaluates 
     ACL2 <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">translated terms</a> to ACL2 values. 
     The interpreter evaluates terms ``in the logic'', 
     without <a href="ACL2____GUARD-CHECKING.html">checking guards</a> and without side effects. 
     The interpreter evaluates <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> non-strictly. 
     The interpreter can be invoked only on 
     (Java representations of) concrete ACL2 values, 
     not on global variables 
     like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> and user-defined <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobjs</a>.</p><p>AIJ is in the <span class="v">java</span> subdirectory of this directory, 
     which contains an <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea" target="_blank"><nobr>IntelliJ IDEA<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.jetbrains.com/idea"></nobr></a> project. 
     The Java code is thoroughly documented with Javadoc. 
     AIJ is in a Java package called <span class="v">edu.kestrel.acl2.aij</span>.</p><p>The Java source files of AIJ may be edited either in IntelliJ IDEA 
     or in a text editor like Emacs. 
     These source files can be compiled either in IntelliJ IDEA 
     or via the <span class="v">Makefile</span> file in this directory, 
     which generates class and jar files in the same place 
     where IntelliJ IDEA does. 
     This <span class="v">Makefile</span> also generates Javadoc HTML documentation.</p><p>AIJ is written in Java 8, 
     which means that it can be compiled 
     using a compiler for Java 8 or later. 
     The aforementioned <span class="v">Makefile</span> assumes that 
     a Java 8 (or later) compiler and related tools (e.g. the latest OpenJDK) 
     is in the path.</p>
