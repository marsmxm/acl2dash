<p>Fixtype of semantic proof trees.</p><p>This is a tagged union type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">fty::deftagsum</a>.</p>

<p>Besides assertions (defined in <span class="tt"><a href="PFCS____ASSERTION.html">assertion</a></span>), 
       the proof system includes proofs, more precisely proof trees. 
       These are structures that, when properly formed, 
       provide proofs of assertions. 
       Here we only define the structure of the proof trees; 
       how they prove assertions is defined later.</p><p>A proof tree must have enough information that 
       it is easy to check whether it proves an assertion or not. 
       We have two kinds of proof trees:</p><ul>
<li>Proof trees that prove equality constraint assertions. 
        This kind of proof tree has no subtrees; 
        it is found at the leaves of larger proof trees.</li>
<li>Proof trees that prove relation application assertions. 
        These include subtrees that must prove the satisfaction of 
        the constraints in the body that defines the relation, 
        for some assignment that extends the one that assigns 
        the values of the expressions to the formal parameters; 
        the assignment must be the same for all the subtrees. 
        This is formalized later; the description above is only a sketch.</li>
</ul>
