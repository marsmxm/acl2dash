<p>The Rules used in the Associativity of App Proof</p><p>Note that under <b>Rules</b> we list the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">runes</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> of all the rules used in the proof.  This list says 
 that we used the rewrite rules <span class="v">CAR-CONS</span> and <span class="v">CDR-CONS</span>, the 
 definitions of the functions <span class="v">NOT</span>, <span class="v">ENDP</span> and <span class="v">APP</span>, and primitive 
 type reasoning (which is how we simplified the <span class="v">IF</span> and <span class="v">EQUAL</span> 
 terms).</p> 
 
 <p>For what it is worth, <span class="v">IMPLIES</span> and <span class="v">AND</span> are actually <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">macros</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a> 
 that are expanded into <span class="v">IF</span> expressions before the proof ever begins.  The 
 use of macros is not reported among the rules.</p>
