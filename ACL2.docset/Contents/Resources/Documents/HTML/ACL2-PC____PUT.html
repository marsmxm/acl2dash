<p>(macro) 
substitute for a ``free variable''</p><pre class="code">Example:
(put x 17)

General Form:
(put var expr)</pre> 
 
 <p>Substitute <span class="v">expr</span> for the ``free variable'' <span class="v">var</span>, as explained 
 below.</p> 
 
 <p>A ``free variable'' is, for our purposes, a variable <span class="v">var</span> such that the 
 instruction <span class="v">(free var)</span> has been executed earlier in the state-stack. 
 What <span class="v">(free var)</span> really does is to let <span class="v">var</span> be an abbreviation for the 
 term <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> var)</span> (see <a href="ACL2-PC____ADD-ABBREVIATION.html">ACL2-pc::add-abbreviation</a>).  What <span class="v">(put var
 expr)</span> really does is to unwind the state-stack, replacing that <span class="v">free</span> 
 instruction with the instruction <span class="v">(add-abbreviation var expr)</span>, so that 
 future references to <span class="v">(? var)</span> become reference to <span class="v">expr</span> rather than to 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> var)</span>, and then to replay all the other instructions that were 
 unwound.  Because <span class="v">hide</span> was used, the expectation is that in most cases, 
 the instructions will replay successfully and <span class="v">put</span> will ``succeed''. 
 However, if any replayed instruction ``fails'', then the entire replay will 
 abort and ``fail'', and the state-stack will revert to its value before the 
 <span class="v">put</span> instruction was executed.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">(put var expr)</span> ``succeeds'', then <span class="v">(remove-abbreviation var)</span> 
 will be executed at the end.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark</b>: The <span class="v">restore</span> command will revert the state-stack to its 
 value present before the <span class="v">put</span> instruction was executed.</p>
