</dl><p>Currently our structure members are very limited.  In the long 
run we may want to support more of the SystemVerilog grammar.  It allows a list 
of variable declaration assignments, which can have fancy dimensions and 
different kinds of <span class="v">new</span> operators.</p> 
 
<p>Notes for the future:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">variable_decl_assignment ::=
      variable_identifier { variable_dimension } [ '=' expression ]
    | dynamic_array_variable_identifier unsized_dimension { variable_dimension } [ '=' dynamic_array_new ]
    | class_variable_identifier [ '=' class_new ]</pre> 
 
<p>These fancy _identifiers are all just identifiers.  So really this is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">variable_decl_assignment ::=
    identifier { variable_dimension }                   [ '=' expression ]
  | identifier unsized_dimension { variable_dimension } [ '=' dynamic_array_new ]
  | identifier                                          [ '=' class_new ]</pre> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">new</span> keyword can occur in a variety of places.  One of these is 
related to defining constructors for classes, e.g., in class constructor 
prototypes/declarations we can have things like</p> 
 
<pre class="code">function ... new (...) ...</pre> 
 
<p>And <span class="v">super.new(...)</span> and so on.  But for now let's think of these as 
separate cases; that is, our approach to <span class="v">new</span> in other contexts doesn't 
necessarily need to have anything to do with these constructors, which we might 
instead handle more explicitly.</p> 
 
<p>The other places where <span class="v">new</span> can occur are in:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">dynamic_array_new ::= new '[' expression ']' [ '(' expression ')' ]

class_new ::= [ class_scope ] 'new' [ '(' list_of_arguments ')' ]
            | 'new' expression</pre> 
 
<p>Which in turn can occur in blocking assignments:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">   [some fancy lhs] = dynamic_array_new
or [some other fancy lhs] = class_new
or other things not involving new</pre> 
 
<p>(Which is interesting because we also have to support a lot of other new 
kinds of assignments like <span class="v">+=</span> and <span class="v">*=</span>, so maybe this could become a 
<span class="v">new=</span> kind of assignment or something.)</p> 
 
<p>And they can also occur in variable decl assignments:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">    simple id [ = expression ]
or  some fancy lhs with some various dimensions [= dynamic_array_new]
or  some simple lhs [= class_new]</pre> 
 
<p>Which can occur in:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>SVA assertion variable declarations</li> 
<li>Data declarations (e.g., top-level <span class="v">const suchandso = new ...</span>
</li> 
<li>Structure members in structs and unions.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>So maybe we don't so much need these to be expressions.  Maybe we can get 
away with them as alternate kinds of assignments.</p>
