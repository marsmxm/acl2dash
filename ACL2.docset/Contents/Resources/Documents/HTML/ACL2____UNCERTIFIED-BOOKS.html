<p>Invalid <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>s and uncertified <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a></p><p>For relevant background see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>, see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>, 
 and see <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">Include-book</a></span> has a special provision for dealing with an 
 uncertified book, i.e., a file with no <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> or an invalid <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> (i.e., one whose <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> values describe files other 
 than the ones actually read).  In this case, a warning is printed and the book 
 is otherwise processed much as though it were certified and had an open <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>If a book <span class="v">B.lisp</span> is uncertified and a file <span class="v">B.port</span> exists, then 
 the forms in <span class="v">B.port</span> are evaluated before the forms in <span class="v">B.lisp</span>.  Such 
 a file <span class="v">B.port</span> is typically created calling <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> on book 
 <span class="v">"B"</span> with argument <span class="v">:write-port t</span>, so that <span class="v">B.port</span> contains the 
 <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s for <span class="v">B</span> (the commands present in the 
 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> when that certification was attempted).  To avoid loading 
 <span class="v">.port</span> files, see <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Inclusion of uncertified books can be handy, but it can have disastrous 
 consequences.</p> 
 
 <p>The provision allowing uncertified <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> to be included can have 
 disastrous consequences, ranging from hard lisp errors, to damaged memory, to 
 quiet logical inconsistency.</p> 
 
 <p>It is possible for the inclusion of an uncertified book to render the logic 
 inconsistent.  For example, one of its non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> might 
 be <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> t-is-nil (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> t nil))</span>.  It is also possible for the 
 inclusion of an uncertified book to cause hard errors or <a href="ACL2____BREAKS.html">breaks</a> into 
 raw Common Lisp.  For example, if the file has been edited since it was 
 certified, it may contain too many open parentheses, causing Lisp to read past 
 ``end of file.'' Similarly, it might contain non-ACL2 objects such as 
 <span class="v">3.1415</span> or ill-formed event forms that cause ACL2 code to break.</p> 
 
 <p>Even if a book is perfectly well formed and could be certified (in a 
 suitable extension of ACL2's initial <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>), its uncertified inclusion 
 might cause Lisp errors or inconsistencies!  For example, it might mention 
 packages that do not exist in the host <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, especially if the 
 <span class="v">.port</span> file (discussed above) does not exist from an earlier certification 
 attempt.  The <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a> of a certified book ensures that the correct 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>s have been admitted, but if a book is read without actually 
 raising its <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>, symbols in the file, e.g., 
 <span class="v">acl2-arithmetic::fn</span>, could cause ``unknown package'' errors in Common 
 Lisp.  Perhaps the most subtle disaster occurs if the host <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> does 
 have a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> for each package used in the book but the host <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> imports different symbols than those required by the <a href="ACL2____PORTCULLIS.html">portcullis</a>.  In this case, it is possible that formulas which were theorems 
 in the certified book are non-theorems in the host <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, but those 
 formulas can be read without error and will then be quietly assumed.</p> 
 
 <p>In short, if you include an uncertified book, <b>all bets are off</b> 
 regarding the validity of the future behavior of ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>That said, it should be noted that ACL2 is pretty tough and if errors don't 
 occur, the chances are that deductions after the inclusion of an uncertified 
 book are probably justified in the (possibly inconsistent) logical extension 
 obtained by assuming the admissibility and validity of the definitions and 
 conjectures in the book.</p>
