<p>How file reading operations are modeled in the ACL2 logic.</p><p>ACL2's <a href="ACL2____IO.html">io</a> operations are available in <span class="v">:logic</span> mode (see 
<a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>).  This is somewhat tricky to justify in the logic, since, 
e.g., the contents of a file is external to ACL2, can be changed over time, and 
so on.</p> 
 
<p>Practically speaking, most users don't need to pay any attention to the 
details of this story.  Instead, they can just include the <a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">std/io</a> 
library, which develops the basic theorems that are necessary to reason about 
the io primitives.</p> 
 
<p>But if for some reason, you do want to understand the logical story, you 
might start with this paper:</p>
