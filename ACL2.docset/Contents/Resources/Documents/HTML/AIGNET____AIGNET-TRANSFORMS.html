<p>Various types of transforms preserving different properties of the AIG</p> 
<p>The following kinds of transforms are defined:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>
<a href="AIGNET____AIGNET-COMB-TRANSFORMS.html">aignet-comb-transforms</a>: Combinational equivalence-preserving transforms</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="AIGNET____AIGNET-N-OUTPUT-COMB-TRANSFORMS.html">aignet-n-output-comb-transforms</a>: Transforms that preserve 
combinational equivalence only on the first <span class="v">n</span> outputs, for a given 
<span class="v">n</span>
</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="AIGNET____AIGNET-M-ASSUMPTION-N-OUTPUT-TRANSFORMS.html">aignet-m-assumption-n-output-transforms</a>: Transforms that preserve 
combinational equivalence of the first <span class="v">m</span> outputs, and preserve 
combinational equivalence of the following <span class="v">n</span> outputs assuming the truth of 
the first <span class="v">m</span> outputs, for given <span class="v">m</span> and <span class="v">n</span>.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Each of these transform types has a constrained function, 
<span class="v">apply-&lt;name&gt;-transform</span>, which takes a source AIG <span class="v">aignet</span>, a 
destination AIG <span class="v">aignet2</span>, a configuration object, and the ACL2 state and 
returns a modified destination AIG and state. The constraints on these define 
the contracts of each transform type.  Using this stub function, we also define 
<span class="v">apply-&lt;name&gt;-transform!</span> which uses <a href="ACL2____SWAP-STOBJS.html">swap-stobjs</a> to overwrite the 
source AIG with the result instead of dealing with a second destination AIG. 
The properties defining these transforms are all transitive, so for each type 
we also define functions <span class="v">apply-&lt;name&gt;-transforms</span> and 
<span class="v">apply-&lt;name&gt;-transforms!</span> which apply a sequence of transforms specified by 
a list of configuration objects.</p> 
 
<p>Each of the transform types has an implementation of its constrained 
<span class="v">apply</span> function defined in <span class="v">centaur/aignet/transforms.lisp</span> and 
attached to the <span class="v">apply</span> function when that book is included.</p>
