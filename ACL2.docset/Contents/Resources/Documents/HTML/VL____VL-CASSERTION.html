<p>Representation of a concurrent assertion.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name — <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>The label for this assertion, if provided.  Note that in a 
                   statement context, labels like <span class="v">foo : assert ...</span>  mainly 
                   get turned into named <span class="v">begin/end</span> blocks, but we do take 
                   care to also put the name into the assertion object.</dd> 
 
<dt>type — <a href="VL____VL-ASSERTTYPE-P.html">vl-asserttype-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The type of this assertion, e.g., <span class="v">assert</span>, <span class="v">assume</span>, 
                   etc.</dd> 
 
<dt>sequencep — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>This should be <span class="v">nil</span> except for <span class="v">cover sequence</span> 
                   statements, where it is <span class="v">t</span>.  Cover statements are 
                   special; most concurrent assertions are just things like 
                   <span class="v">assert property ...</span> or <span class="v">assume property ...</span>  and 
                   don't even have a <span class="v">sequence</span> form.</dd> 
 
<dt>condition — <a href="VL____VL-PROPSPEC.html">vl-propspec</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The property specification being asserted.</dd> 
 
<dt>success — <a href="VL____VL-STMT.html">vl-stmt</a>
</dt> 
<dd>For most assertions, this is the success statement for the 
                   associated action block, or a <a href="VL____VL-NULLSTMT.html">vl-nullstmt</a> if there 
                   is no success statement.  Note that <span class="v">cover</span> assertions 
                   are special and don't have an action block, so for a 
                   <span class="v">cover</span> assertion this is just the associated 
                   statement, if any.</dd> 
 
<dt>failure — <a href="VL____VL-STMT.html">vl-stmt</a>
</dt> 
<dd>This is the <span class="v">else</span> statement from the action block, or 
                   a <a href="VL____VL-NULLSTMT.html">vl-nullstmt</a> if there is no <span class="v">else</span> statement. 
                   For <span class="v">cover</span> assertions this is always just a <a href="VL____VL-NULLSTMT.html">vl-nullstmt</a> since there is no <span class="v">else</span> action.</dd> 
 
<dt>loc — <a href="VL____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Location of this statement in the source code.</dd>
