<p>Conversion to Uppercase</p><p>When symbols are read by Common Lisp they are converted to upper 
 case.  Note carefully that this remark applies to the characters in 
 <i>symbols</i>.  The characters in strings are not converted upper case.</p> 
 
 <p>To type a symbol containing lower case characters you can enclose the 
 symbol in vertical bars, as in <span class="v">|AbC|</span> or you can put a ``backslash'' 
 before each lower case character you wish to preserve, as in <span class="v">A\bC</span>. 
 <span class="v">|AbC|</span> and <span class="v">A\bC</span> are two different ways of writing the same symbol 
 (just like 2/4 and 1/2 are two different ways of writing the same rational and 
 123 and 0123 are two different ways to write the same natural number).  The 
 symbol has three characters in its name, the middle one of which is a lower 
 case b.</p>
