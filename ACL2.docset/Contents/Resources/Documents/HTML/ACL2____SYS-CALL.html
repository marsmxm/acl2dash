<p>Make a system call to the host operating system</p><pre class="code">Example Forms:
(<a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> "cp" '("foo.lisp" "foo-copied.lisp"))
(<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (<a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> "cp" '("foo.lisp" "foo-copied.lisp"))
        (<a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a> state))</pre> 
 
 <p>The first argument of <span class="v">sys-call</span> is a command for the host operating 
 system, and the second argument is a list of strings that are the arguments 
 for that command.</p> 
 
 <p>The use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span> in the second example form above is optional, but 
 illustrates how to get the return status.  See <a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a>. 
 <span class="v">Sys-call</span> itself always returns <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>WARNING</b>: The details of how <span class="v">sys-call</span> works can vary among 
 different host Lisp implementations!  Consider for example wildcard expansion, 
 such as when executing the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> "ls" '("*.lisp"))</span>.  For 
 ACL2 built on Allegro CL, CCL, CMUCL, GCL, or SBCL, we have seen this result 
 in an error message such as <span class="v">"No such file or directory"</span>, even though 
 file of with names of the form <span class="v">*.lisp</span> are present in the current 
 directory; but for ACL2 built on LispWorks, a list of such filenames is 
 printed.  For another example, in GCL and perhaps some other lisps, you can 
 put the arguments with the command; but this is not the case, for example, in 
 Allegro CL running on Linux.</p> 
 
 <p>More generally, we note that <span class="v">sys-call</span> does not provide some features 
 that one may expect of a shell.  We mentioned wildcard expansion above; other 
 sorts of shell expansion may also not be supported, such as <span class="v">~/</span>. 
 <span class="v">Sys-call</span> also does not directly support output redirection.  If you want 
 to run a program, <span class="v">P</span>, and redirect its output, one option is to create a 
 wrapper script, <span class="v">W</span> to call instead.  Thus <span class="v">W</span> might be a shell script 
 containing the line:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">P $* &gt;&amp; foo.out</pre> 
 
 <p>Another approach is suggested by <a href="https://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter9.2.html" target="_blank"><nobr>a passage in the CCL 
 manual<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter9.2.html"></nobr></a>: call the shell program.  For example, here is a how one might list 
 the <span class="v">.lisp</span> files in a directory.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> "sh" '("-c" "ls *.lisp"))</pre> 
 
 <p>For related utilities, see <a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL_A2.html">sys-call*</a> and <a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL_B2.html">sys-call+</a>.  Both of 
 those utilities return a suitable status (rather than requiring a separate 
 call of a separate function, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a></span>, as described later 
 below).  Also, <span class="v">sys-call+</span> returns the command's output, but (like 
 <span class="v">sys-call</span>) <span class="v">sys-call*</span> does not.  An important distinction is that both 
 <span class="v">sys-call+</span> and <span class="v">sys-call*</span> can make their calls to the operating system 
 during proofs, unlike <span class="v">sys-call</span> as we now explain.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Sys-call</span> does not invoke the operating system when it is invoked 
 inside the theorem prover or <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>.  The following example, 
 from Eric Smith, illustrates this point: presumably we only want to reason 
 about the return value, not write a file during a proof!</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> foo)
(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> "touch" (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> "/tmp/XXX"))
            nil)
     :hints (("Goal" :in-theory (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> (:type-prescription sys-call)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Through Version 7.4, running this example did indeed create file 
 <span class="v">/tmp/XXX</span> if that file did not already exist.  Now, the <a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> of <span class="v">sys-call</span> is disabled, which avoids that 
 specific behavior.  Moreover: even with that executable-counterpart enabled, 
 no file is created; <span class="v">sys-call</span> returns <span class="v">nil</span> without invoking the 
 operating system.  If such an evaluation attempt occurs during invocation of a 
 <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a> or <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>function, then an error will be 
 signaled.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a> cmd args)</pre> 
 
 <p>This function logically returns <span class="v">nil</span>.  However, it makes the indicated 
 call to the host operating system, as described above (not during a proof), 
 using a function supplied ``under the hood'' by the underlying Lisp system. 
 This is an advanced feature that requires a trust tag (see below).  As noted 
 above, host lisps differ on their handling of <span class="v">sys-call</span>; see the raw Lisp 
 definition of ACL2 source function <span class="v">system-call</span> for details, including 
 exactly the underlying Lisp code that is invoked.  You can then look at that 
 host lisp's manual for details about that underlying function.</p> 
 
 <p>On occasions where one wishes to obtain the numeric status returned by the 
 host operating system (or more precisely, by the Lisp function under the hood 
 that passes the system call to the host operating system), one may do so; see 
 <a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a>.  The status value is the value returned by that Lisp 
 function, which may well be the same numeric value returned by the host 
 operating system for the underlying system call.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">sys-call</span> does not touch the ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>; however, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL-STATUS.html">sys-call-status</a></span> updates the <span class="v">acl2-oracle</span> field of the 
 <span class="v">state</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Be careful if you use <span class="v">sys-call</span>!  It can be used for example to 
 overwrite files, or worse!  We view a use of <span class="v">sys-call</span> as a call to the 
 operating system that is made outside ACL2.  The following example from Bob 
 Boyer shows how to use <span class="v">sys-call</span> to execute, in effect, arbitrary Lisp 
 forms.  ACL2 provides a ``trust tag'' mechanism that requires execution of a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a></span> form before you can use <span class="v">sys-call</span>; see <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>. 
 (Note: The setting of the raw Lisp variable <span class="v">*features*</span> below is just to 
 illustrate that any such mischief is possible.  Normally <span class="v">*features*</span> is a 
 list with more than a few elements.)</p>
