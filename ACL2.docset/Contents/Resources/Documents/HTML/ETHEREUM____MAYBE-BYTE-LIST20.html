<p>Fixtype of byte arrays of length 20 and <span class="v">nil</span>.</p><p>This is an option type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFOPTION.html">fty::defoption</a>. 
              Note that <span class="v">defoption</span> is just a wrapper for <a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">fty::defflexsum</a>, so there are <span class="v">:none</span> and <span class="v">:some</span> member 
              types, a case macro, and so forth.</p><h5>Member Types</h5><dl>

<p>The \mathbf{to} field of a transaction [YP:4.2] is 
     either a 20-byte (i.e. 160-bit) address 
     or the empty array (i.e. the only element of \mathbb{B}_0) [YP:(18)]. 
     Both [YP:4.2] and [YP:(18)] mention \varnothing as 
     the (only) element of \mathbb{B}_0; 
     however, according to the definition of \mathbb{B} [YP:(178)], 
     the empty array should be denoted as ().</p><p>Regardless, in our model the empty byte array is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     so we use either a list of 20 bytes or <span class="v">nil</span> 
     to model the \mathbf{to} field of a transaction.</p>
