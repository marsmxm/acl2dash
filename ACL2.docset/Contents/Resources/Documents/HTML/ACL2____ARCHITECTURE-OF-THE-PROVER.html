<p>A simple overview of how the prover works</p><p>Six built-in proof techniques are used by ACL2 to decompose the 
 goal formula into subgoals.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<i>simplification</i> — decision procedures and rewriting with 
 previously proved rules, but actually including a host of other techniques 
 under your control.  Simplification is the only proof technique that can 
 reduce a formula to 0 subgoals (i.e., prove it) rather than just transform it 
 to other formulas.  The predominant activity in most proofs is simplification. 
 There are many ways you can affect what the simplifier does to your formulas. 
 Good users spend most of their time thinking about how to control the 
 simplifier.</li> 
 
 <li>
<i>destructor elimination</i> — getting rid of ``destructor terms'' 
 like <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">CDR</a> X)</span> by replacing a variable, e.g., <span class="v">X</span>, by a 
 ``constructor'' term, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">CONS</a> A B)</span>.  But you can tell ACL2 about new 
 destructor/constructor combinations.</li> 
 
 <li>
<i>fertilization</i> — using an equivalence hypothesis by 
  substituting one side for the other in the goal.  When under induction, ACL2 
  may decide to restrict the substitution as follows, using its so-called 
  <i>cross-fertilization</i> heuristic: substitute only into one side of the 
  conclusion, thus using an inductive hypothesis in preparation for possible 
  generalization in advance of another induction.  Note that 
  cross-fertilization is used only when generalization is enabled: with the 
  hint <span class="v">:do-not '(<a href="ACL2____GENERALIZE.html">generalize</a>)</span>, only full fertilization is applied.</li> 
 
 <li>
<i>generalization</i> — replacing a term by a new variable and 
 restricting the new variable to have some of the properties of the term.  You 
 can control the restrictions imposed on the new variable.  This is a heuristic 
 that prepares the goal for another induction.</li> 
 
 <li>
<i>elimination of irrelevance</i> — throwing away unnecessary 
 hypotheses.  This is a heuristic that prepares the goal for another 
 induction.</li> 
 
 <li>
<i>induction</i> — selecting an induction scheme to prove a formula. 
 Inductions are ``suggested'' by the recursive functions appearing in the 
 formula.  But you can control what inductions are suggested by terms.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>But you can add additional techniques, called <i>clause processors</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>The various techniques are tried in turn, with simplification first and 
 induction last.  Each technique reports one of three outcomes: it found 
 nothing to change (i.e., the technique doesn't <i>apply</i> to that subgoal), 
 it decided to abort the proof attempt (typically because there is reason to 
 believe the proof is failing), or it decomposed the goal into <i>k</i> 
 subgoals.</p> 
 
 <p>The last outcome has a special case: if <i>k</i> is 0 then the technique 
 proved the goal.  Whenever <i>k</i> is non-0, the process starts over again 
 with simplification on each of the <i>k</i> subgoals.  However, it saves up 
 all the subgoals for which induction is the only proof technique left to 
 try. That way you see how it performs on every base case and induction step of 
 one induction before it launches into another induction.</p> 
 
 <p>It runs until you or one of the proof techniques aborts the proof attempt 
 or until all subgoals have been proved.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that if simplification produces a subgoal, that subgoal is 
 re-simplified.  This process continues until the subgoal cannot be simplified 
 further.  Only then is the next proof technique is tried.  Such subgoals are 
 said to be <i>stable under simplification</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>While this is happening, the prover prints an English narrative describing 
 the process.  Basically, after each goal is printed, the system prints an 
 English paragraph that names the next applicable proof technique, gives a 
 brief description of what that technique does to the subgoal, and says how 
 many new subgoals are produced.  Then each subgoal is dealt with in turn.</p> 
 
 <p>If the proof is successful, you could read this log as a proof of the 
 conjecture.  But output from successful proofs is generally never read because 
 it is not important to The Method described in <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The output of an unsuccessful proof attempt concludes with some <i>key</i> 
 <i>checkpoints</i> which usually bear looking at.</p>
