<p>Recursive equivalents of logical operations.</p><p>The logical operations on numbers, e.g., <a href="ACL2____LOGHEAD.html">loghead</a>, <a href="ACL2____LOGAPP.html">logapp</a>, etc., are defined in terms of modular arithmetic.  It is often useful, 
however, to consider these functions as if they were recursive in terms of 
<a href="ACL2____LOGCAR.html">logcar</a> and <a href="ACL2____LOGCDR.html">logcdr</a>.  This theory provides that alternate view of 
the functions.  When this theory is <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a>d, lemmas are enabled that 
rewrite all of the logical operations listed above into an equivalent recursive 
form.  It is then possible to do inductive proofs using these definitions. 
Note, however, that you will have to explicitly select an induction scheme.</p> 
 
<p>Note that this theory is <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d by default.  It should only be 
<a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a>d during proofs about logical operations where their recursive 
counterparts are to be used.</p>
