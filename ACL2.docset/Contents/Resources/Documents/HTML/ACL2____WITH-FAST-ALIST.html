<p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-FAST-ALIST.html">with-fast-alist</a> name form)</span> causes <span class="v">name</span> to be a fast alist 
for the execution of <span class="v">form</span>.</p><p>Logically, <span class="v">with-fast-alist</span> just returns <span class="v">form</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, we cause <span class="v">alist</span> to become a fast alist before executing 
 <span class="v">form</span>.  If doing so caused us to introduce a new hash table, the hash 
 table is automatically freed after <span class="v">form</span> completes.</p> 
 
 <p>More accurately, under the hood <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WITH-FAST-ALIST.html">with-fast-alist</a> name form)</span> 
 essentially expands to something like:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (already-fast-alist-p name)
    form
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a> ((&lt;temp&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MAKE-FAST-ALIST.html">make-fast-alist</a> name)))
    (prog1 form
           (<a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-FREE.html">fast-alist-free</a> &lt;temp&gt;))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Practically speaking, <span class="v">with-fast-alist</span> is frequently a better choice 
 then just using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-FAST-ALIST.html">make-fast-alist</a></span>, and is particularly useful for 
 writing functions that can take either fast or slow alists as arguments.  That 
 is, consider the difference between:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> bad (alist ...)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((<a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST.html">fast-alist</a> (<a href="ACL2____MAKE-FAST-ALIST.html">make-fast-alist</a> alist))
         (answer     (expensive-computation fast-alist ...)))
   (<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (<a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-FREE.html">fast-alist-free</a> fast-alist)
           answer)))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> good (alist ...)
   (<a href="ACL2____WITH-FAST-ALIST.html">with-fast-alist</a> alist
     (expensive-computation alist ...)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Either approach is fine if the caller provides a slow <span class="v">alist</span>.  But if 
 the input <span class="v">alist</span> is already fast, <span class="v">bad</span> will (perhaps unexpectedly) 
 free it!  On the other hand, <span class="v">good</span> is able to take advantage of an 
 already-fast argument and will not cause it to be inadvertently freed.</p> 
 
 <p>See also the macro <span class="v">with-fast-alists</span> defined in the community book 
 <span class="v">"books/centaur/misc/hons-extra.lisp"</span>, which allows you to call <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-FAST-ALIST.html">with-fast-alist</a></span> on several alists simultaneously.</p> 
 
 <p>The community book <span class="v">"books/centaur/misc/hons-extra.lisp"</span> extends the 
 <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> macro with the <span class="v">with-fast</span> pattern binder.  That is, after 
 executing <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/misc/hons-extra.lisp" :dir :system)</span> 
 you may write something like this:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> (...
     ((with-fast a b c ...))
     ...)
  ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>which causes <span class="v">a</span>, <span class="v">b</span>, and <span class="v">c</span> to become fast alists until the 
 completion of the <span class="v">b*</span> form.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">with-fast-alist</span> will cause logically tail-recursive 
 functions not to execute tail-recursively if its cleanup phase happens after 
 the tail-recursive call returns.</p>
