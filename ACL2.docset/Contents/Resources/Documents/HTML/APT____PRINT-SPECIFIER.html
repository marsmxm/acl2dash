<p>Specifies the screen output printed by an APT transformation.</p><p>A print specifier is passed as the <span class="v">:print</span> input to a transformation. 
     It must be one of the following:</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="v">nil</span>, to print nothing (not even error output).</li>
<li>
<span class="v">:error</span>, to print only error output (if any).</li>
<li>
<span class="v">:result</span>, to print, 
      besides error output, 
      the generated functions and theorems 
      described in reference documentation of the transformation, 
      i.e. the result of the transformation. 
      This is the default value of the <span class="v">:print</span> input.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">:info</span>, to print, 
       besides error output and the result (see <span class="v">:result</span> above), 
       some additional information 
       about the operations performed by the transformation.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">:all</span>, to print, 
      besides error output, 
      the result, 
      and the additional information (see <span class="v">:info</span> above), 
      also ACL2's output in response to all the submitted events 
      (the ones that form the result as well as some ancillary ones).</li>
</ul><p>If the call to the transformation is 
     <a href="APT____REDUNDANCY.html">redundant</a>, 
     a message to that effect is printed on the screen, 
     unless <span class="v">:print</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.</p>
