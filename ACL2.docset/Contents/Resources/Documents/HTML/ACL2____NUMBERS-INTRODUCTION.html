<p>Numbers in ACL2</p><p>ACL2 numbers are precisely represented and unbounded.  They can be 
 partitioned into the following subtypes:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Numbers
 |
 |- Rationals
 |  |
 |  |- Integers
 |  |  |- Positive integers                 3
 |  |  |- Zero                              0
 |  |  |- Negative Integers                 -3
 |  |
 |  |- Non-Integral Rationals
 |  |  |
 |  |  |- Positive Non-Integral Rationals   19/3
 |  |  |- Negative Non-Integral Rationals   -22/7
 |
 |- Complex Rational Numbers                 #c(3 5/2) ; i.e., 3 + (5/2)i</pre> 
 
 <p>Signed integer constants are usually written (as illustrated above) as 
 sequences of decimal digits, possibly preceded by <span class="v">+</span> or <span class="v">-</span>.  Decimal 
 points are not allowed.  Integers may be written in binary, as in <span class="v">#b1011</span> 
 (= 23) and <span class="v">#b-111</span> (= -7).  Octal may also be used, <span class="v">#o-777</span> = -511. 
 Non-integral rationals are written as a signed decimal integer and an unsigned 
 decimal integer, separated by a slash.  Complex rationals are written as 
 #c(rpart ipart) where rpart and ipart are rationals.</p> 
 
 <p>Of course, 4/2 = 2/1 = 2 (i.e., not every rational written with a slash is 
 a non-integer).  Similarly, #c(4/2 0) = #c(2 0) = 2.</p> 
 
 <p>The common arithmetic functions and relations are denoted by <span class="v">+</span>, 
 <span class="v">-</span>, <span class="v">*</span>, <span class="v">/</span>, <span class="v">=</span>, <span class="v">&lt;</span>, <span class="v">&lt;=</span>, <span class="v">&gt;</span> and <span class="v">&gt;=</span>.  However 
 there are many others, e.g., <span class="v">floor</span>, <span class="v">ceiling</span>, and <span class="v">lognot</span>.  See 
 any Common Lisp language documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>The primitive predicates for recognizing numbers are illustrated below. 
 The following ACL2 function will classify an object, x, according to its 
 numeric subtype, or else return 'NaN (not a number).  We show it this way just 
 to illustrate programming in ACL2.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> classify-number (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____RATIONALP.html">rationalp</a> x)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> x)
                (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> 0 x) 'positive-integer)
                      ((<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> 0 x) 'zero)
                      (t 'negative-integer)))
               ((<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> 0 x) 'positive-non-integral-rational)
               (t 'negative-non-integral-rational)))
        ((<a href="ACL2____COMPLEX-RATIONALP.html">complex-rationalp</a> x) 'complex-rational)
        (t 'NaN)))</pre>
