<p>Programming Considerations</p><p>This chapter discusses some things to keep in mind when modifying 
 the ACL2 sources.  It is not intended to discuss any particular aspects of the 
 ACL2 source code, but rather, to highlight some general principles.</p> 
 
 <font color="#800080"> 
 <p>ALL OF THIS TOPIC IS VERY IMPORTANT.</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <h3>Keep the user in mind</h3> 
 
 <p>Error and warning messages take time to write, but can (obviously) be 
 really helpful to users.  Avoid trying to say too much in one message, instead 
 pointing to one or more <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> topics for elaboration if 
 appropriate.</p> 
 
 <p>It is generally fine to change a system utility's behavior or even to 
 delete its definition.  However, this is discouraged if that utility is 
 documented; otherwise there could be an annoyed user who is adversely 
 affected.</p> 
 
 <h3>Program defensively</h3> 
 
 <p>It is a good idea to look for precedents.  See also the discussion of 
 precedents in the topic, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-MAINTENANCE.html">developers-guide-maintenance</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Add assertions and errors when appropriate.  For example, the function 
 <span class="v">all-runes-in-ttree</span> contains a large <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CASE.html">case</a></span> expression, which covers 
 each tag that could occur in a tag tree.  The last case is an error whose 
 message mentions the bad tag together with the values associated with that 
 tag.</p> 
 
 <p>Check invariants.  For example, the function <span class="v">check-acl2-initialization</span> 
 checks some properties that are expected to hold at the end of a build; in 
 particular, it calls <span class="v">check-none-ideal</span>, which reports <a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a>-mode 
 functions that are not <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-verified.  (If a logic-mode function is 
 not guard-verified, then it may run slowly.  We don't want built-in functions 
 to run slowly.)</p> 
 
 <h3>Use installed worlds</h3> 
 
 <p>Fundamental utilities for ACL2 programmers are the function, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GETPROP.html">getprop</a></span>, and its associated abbreviation, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GETPROPC.html">getpropc</a></span>.  <span class="v">Getprop</span> is 
 defined in the logic to walk through a given logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, much as 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____ASSOC.html">assoc</a></span> walks through a given association list.  However, <span class="v">getprop</span> 
 is defined ``under-the-hood'' with raw Lisp code (see the discussion of 
 <span class="v">acl2-loop-only</span> in <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-BACKGROUND.html">developers-guide-background</a>) so that if the 
 world is what we call ``installed'', typically <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state)</span>, then access is 
 essentially constant-time.  The ACL2 utilities <span class="v">set-w</span>, <span class="v">set-w!</span>, 
 <span class="v">extend-world</span>, and <span class="v">retract-world</span> all may be invoked to install 
 worlds, but it is rarely necessary or even advisable to call these directly. 
 They are typically used in the implementations of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Typically, ACL2 system programming passes along worlds that are installed, 
 and one needn't think about whether a world is installed or not.  A major 
 exception is when code recurs through the world, looking for a suitable 
 triple.  Consider the source code definition of <span class="v">new-verify-guards-fns1</span>; 
 we include an elided version of it here.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> new-verify-guards-fns1 (wrld installed-wrld acc)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard ...))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> wrld) ...)
         ...)
        ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADAR.html">cadar</a> wrld) 'symbol-class)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDDAR.html">cddar</a> wrld) :COMMON-LISP-COMPLIANT)
              (<a href="ACL2____GETPROPC.html">getpropc</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAAR.html">caar</a> wrld) 'predefined nil installed-wrld))
         (new-verify-guards-fns1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> wrld)
                                 installed-wrld
                                 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAAR.html">caar</a> wrld) acc)))
        (t (new-verify-guards-fns1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> wrld) installed-wrld acc))))</pre> 
 
 <p>We may reasonably assume from its name that the argument 
 <span class="v">installed-wrld</span> is an installed world.  That's a good thing, since it 
 guarantees that the <span class="v">getpropc</span> call above will be fast.  Suppose, by 
 contrast, that the definition had been made in the following, more 
 ``straightforward'', manner.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> BAD-new-verify-guards-fns1 (wrld acc)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard ...))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> wrld) ...)
         ...)
        ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADAR.html">cadar</a> wrld) 'symbol-class)
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDDAR.html">cddar</a> wrld) :COMMON-LISP-COMPLIANT)
              (<a href="ACL2____GETPROPC.html">getpropc</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAAR.html">caar</a> wrld) 'predefined nil wrld))
         (BAD-new-verify-guards-fns1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> wrld)
                                     (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAAR.html">caar</a> wrld) acc)))
        (t (BAD-new-verify-guards-fns1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> wrld) installed-wrld acc))))</pre> 
 
 <p>As we cdr down the given world, we deal with worlds that are not the 
 installed world.  The <span class="v">getpropc</span> call will then need to walk linearly 
 through its world until it finds the desired property  typically very 
 far from constant-time behavior.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that there are occasions for which the world is extended a bit before 
 properties are obtained, and that's fine.  For example, in the source code 
 definition of function <span class="v">chk-acceptable-defuns1</span> we find a call 
 <span class="v">(putprop-x-lst1 names 'symbol-class symbol-class wrld1)</span>, which 
 contributes to an extension of <span class="v">wrld1</span> that will ultimately be used for 
 definitional processing, including the termination proof.  The prover makes 
 many calls of <span class="v">getprop</span> (typically via <span class="v">getpropc</span>) on that extended 
 world.  Normally this isn't a problem: <span class="v">getprop</span> will then walk linearly 
 through the new part of the world but will soon hit the installed world, and 
 then finish its work quickly.  When large <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span> nests are 
 involved, this could be problematic, except that this issue is taken care of 
 by the <span class="v">big-mutrec</span> hack; see for example the definition of 
 <span class="v">defuns-fn1</span>.  But we're getting into the weeds now; our point is that 
 <span class="v">getprop</span> and <span class="v">getpropc</span> do best with worlds that are installed or are 
 modest extensions of installed worlds.</p> 
 
 <h3>More generally, program efficiently</h3> 
 
 <p>Program with tail-recursion when possible, as tail-recursive functions are 
 less likely to cause stack overflows and might also execute more 
 efficiently.</p> 
 
 <p>Undoubtedly there are many other tips that could be given here on efficient 
 programming.  Maybe they'll be added over time.</p> 
 
 <h3>Write good comments</h3> 
 
 <p>This is a matter of taste, and tastes vary.  Probably we can all agree that 
 obvious bits of simple code need not be commented; for example, the code 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> lst1 lst2)</span> does not need a comment ``concatenate the two 
 lists''.  At the other extreme, probably we can all agree that a complex 
 algorithm deserves a comment.  When in doubt it might be best to write a bit 
 too much rather than a bit too little.  A good guiding principle is to imagine 
 yourself reading the code ten or twenty years later; will it make sense?</p> 
 
 <p>NOTE: If a comment is worth putting into a git commit message, then it's 
 probably worth putting into the source code or documentation.</p> 
 
 <h3>Use good names</h3> 
 
 <p>For new names, avoid common strings so that it's easy to tags-search for 
 them later.  Good examples include <span class="v">"rune"</span> and <span class="v">"pspv"</span> for the 
 data structures, ``RUle NamE'' and ``Prover SPecial Variable'' (see the record 
 <span class="v">prove-spec-var</span>).  (With the Emacs command <span class="v">meta-x tags-apropos</span> you 
 can see many function names that mention include these two strings.)  A 
 thesaurus such as <a href="http://thesaurus.com" target="_blank"><nobr>thesaurus.com<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://thesaurus.com"></nobr></a> may be 
 helpful in naming a notion.</p> 
 
 <p>Do not abbreviate excessively.  Good naming examples may be found in the 
 fields of the record <span class="v">prove-spec-var</span>.  These fields are not well 
 commented, but the names are helpful; for example, the field name 
 <span class="v">user-supplied-term</span> is suggestive of the contents of that field, i.e., the 
 term supplied to the prover by the user.  For another example, the function 
 <span class="v">rewrite-with-linear</span> hints at its purpose, which is to use linear 
 arithmetic during rewriting.  If we see a call of this function we can get a 
 sense of what it's about.  That would be more difficult if the function were 
 named <span class="v">rwl</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>But this is a matter of taste.  For example, the function 
 <span class="v">assume-true-false</span> hints at its functionality, which, roughly speaking, is 
 to extend a <a href="ACL2____TYPE-ALIST.html">type-alist</a> by assuming an <span class="v">IF</span> test either true or 
 false.  So why is there a function <span class="v">mv-atf</span>?  This is not such a huge 
 transgression, since it's only used in the implementation of 
 <span class="v">assume-true-false</span>, so if you see it then your head is probably in a place 
 where the abbreviation <span class="v">atf</span> makes sense.</p> 
 
 <h3>Add tests</h3> 
 
 <p>This is something that could probably be done more often; as of this 
 writing, unit testing of specific features is relatively rare or in Lisp 
 comments.  The <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> directories <span class="v">books/system/tests/</span> and 
 <span class="v">books/demos/</span> are places to put small, specific tests, and others exist 
 elsewhere, for example, the four test files 
 <span class="v">books/misc/defabsstobj-example-*.lisp</span>.  So there really aren't specific 
 places to place tests.  If you run the following command in the <span class="v">books/</span> 
 directory, you will find that there are likely well over 100 books that do 
 some sort of testing, albeit not necessarily of specific features implemented 
 in the ACL2 source code (159 of these as of this writing).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">find . -name '*test*.lisp' -print | fgrep -v quicklisp | wc -l</pre> 
 
 <h3>In general, be careful</h3> 
 
 <p>Of course, that's easier said than done!  But please, at the least, make 
 some effort to avoid introducing inefficiencies, unclear code, or (especially) 
 unsoundness.</p> 
 
 <p>Let us consider one example: the question of whether to skip certain checks 
 when proofs are skipped.  You may want to look for precedents (as discussed 
 above).  You may find that when <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a> state)</span> is 
 <span class="v">'include-book</span> or <span class="v">'include-book-with-locals</span>, the function 
 <span class="v">load-theory-into-enabled-structure</span> avoids a call of 
 <span class="v">chk-theory-invariant</span> (actually shown as <span class="v">chk-theory-invariant@par</span>; 
 see the discussion of ACL2(p) in the chapter, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-BACKGROUND.html">developers-guide-background</a>).  Thus, theory invariants <i>are</i> checked 
 when <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a> state)</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, i.e., when we are skipping proofs 
 but not including a book (as discussed in the chapter, <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-LOGIC.html">developers-guide-logic</a>).  The idea here is that when including a certified 
 book, we check theory-invariants just once, at the end of the book inclusion 
 process, for efficiency.  So one way to be careful is to do various checks 
 even when <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a> state)</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, even if these checks are to 
 be skipped when including books.</p>
