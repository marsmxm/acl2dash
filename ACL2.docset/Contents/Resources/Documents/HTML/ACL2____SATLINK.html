<p>A simple representation for Boolean formulas in <a href="SATLINK____CNF.html">conjunctive normal form</a>, and a mechanism for calling SAT solvers 
from within ACL2 and trusting what they say. (CCL Only)</p><p>SAT solvers are programs that can solve the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem" target="_blank"><nobr>Boolean 
satisfiability problem<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem"></nobr></a>.  Modern solvers implement clever algorithms in fast 
languages like C and C++, so they can quickly solve many large problems. 
Developing faster SAT solvers is an active area of research with frequent <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/" target="_blank"><nobr>competitions<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.satcompetition.org/"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
<p>SAT solvers are useful because many problems can be recast as SAT problems. 
For instance, the <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> framework can translate many ACL2 proof goals, 
e.g., bounded arithmetic problems, into SAT problems.  This allows for a large 
class of theorems to be solved quickly and automatically by the SAT solver. 
This is especially useful in <a href="ACL2____HARDWARE-VERIFICATION.html">ACL2::hardware-verification</a>.</p> 
 
<p><b>Satlink</b> is an interfacing library that allows ACL2 to make use of 
off-the-shelf SAT solvers like <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/" target="_blank"><nobr>lingeling<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://fmv.jku.at/lingeling/"></nobr></a>, <a href="http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/" target="_blank"><nobr>glucose<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/glucose/"></nobr></a>, and so on; see 
<a href="SATLINK____SAT-SOLVER-OPTIONS.html">sat-solver-options</a> for download and build help.  It provides:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>A (trivial) representation and semantics for Boolean formulas in 
conjunctive normal form; see <a href="SATLINK____CNF.html">cnf</a>.</li> 
 
<li>A function, <a href="SATLINK____SAT.html">sat</a>, that can invoke a SAT solver on a formula and 
interpret its output.  This is done via <a href="ACL2____TSHELL.html">tshell</a>, so the integration 
is very smooth, e.g., you can interrupt the SAT solver.</li> 
 
<li>A <a href="SATLINK____LOGICAL-STORY.html">logical-story</a> that allows us to <font color="#ff0000"><b>assume, 
using a <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">trust tag</a></b></font>, that when the 
SAT solver claims the formula is unsatisfiable, it's correct.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>We don't have to assume anything when the SAT solver claims that a formula 
is satisfiable, since we can just check the alleged satisfying assignment it 
produces.</p> 
 
<p>The soundness threat may be reduced by checking the output of the SAT 
solver.  There has been recent progress in the SAT community toward 
standardizing formats for UNSAT proofs, reducing the overhead of producing 
these proofs, and developing fast tools to check these proofs.  Satlink 
includes, e.g., a <span class="v">glucose-cert</span> script that implements this idea; see <a href="SATLINK____SAT-SOLVER-OPTIONS.html">sat-solver-options</a>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Loading the Library</h3> 
 
<p>Satlink is a low-level library.  It would be a bit weird to want to use it 
directly.  Instead, it is typically used indirectly through other tools, such 
as the <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> framework, or <a href="ACL2____AIG-SAT.html">ACL2::aig-sat</a>, or the <a href="AIGNET____AIGNET-CNF.html">aignet::aignet-cnf</a> translation.  These other approaches are likely to be more 
convenient than using Satlink directly.</p> 
 
<p>If you want to include Satlink directly for some reason, the book to include 
is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/satlink/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>Once you load this book, you generally need to construct your input <a href="SATLINK____CNF.html">cnf</a> formula in some way, and then call <a href="SATLINK____SAT.html">sat</a>.</p>
