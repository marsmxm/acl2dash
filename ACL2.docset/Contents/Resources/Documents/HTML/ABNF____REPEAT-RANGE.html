<p>Fixtype of repetition ranges.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p>

</dl><p>In the abstract syntax, 
    for the repetition notation described in [RFC:3.6] and [RFC:3.7] 
    and by rule <span class="v">repeat</span> in [RFC:4], 
    we use pairs of natural numbers and natural numbers plus infinity. 
    A specific repetition [RFC:3.7] is abstracted 
    to a variable repetition [RFC:3.6] with the same minimum and maximum. 
    A repetition with a missing lower bound is abstracted 
    to one with the default (i.e. 0) as lower bound. 
    A repetition with a missing upper bound is abstracted 
    to one with the default (i.e. infinity) as explicit upper bound. 
    The notion of <a href="ABNF____REPEAT-RANGE-WFP.html">well-formed repetition ranges</a> requires the minimum not to exceed the maximum.</p>
