<p>A Sketch of How the Rewriter Works</p><p>Below we show the first target term, extracted from the current 
 conjecture.  Below it we show the associativity rule.</p> 
 
 <p><div class="ximg"><img src="../res/tours/uaa-rewrite.gif"></div></p> 
 
 <p>The variables of the rewrite rule are <b>instantiated</b> so that the 
 <b>left-hand side</b> of the rule matches the target:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">variable          term from target
  a                     x1
  b                     x2
  c                     (app x3 x4)</pre> 
 
 <p>Then the target is <b>replaced</b> by the instantiated <b>right-hand 
 side</b> of the rule.</p> 
 
 <p>Sometimes rules have <b>hypotheses</b>.  To make a long story short, if the 
 rule has hypotheses, then after matching the left-hand side, the rewriter 
 instantiates the hypotheses and rewrites them recursively.  This is called 
 <b>backchaining</b>.  If they all rewrite to true, then the target is replaced 
 as above.</p> 
 
 <p>We discuss the rewriter in more detail in the extended introduction to how 
 to use the theorem prover, see <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-THE-THEOREM-PROVER.html">introduction-to-the-theorem-prover</a>, 
 which we will recommend you work through <b>after</b> you have finished the 
 two tours.</p>
