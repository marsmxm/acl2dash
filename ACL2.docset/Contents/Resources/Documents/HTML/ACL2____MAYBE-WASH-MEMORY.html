<p>Conditionally trigger a <a href="ACL2____HONS-WASH.html">hons-wash</a> and also <a href="ACL2____CLEAR-MEMOIZE-TABLES.html">clear-memoize-tables</a> to reclaim memory.  (CCL only; requires a 
  trust tag)</p><p><span class="tt">(maybe-wash-memory n &amp;optional clear)</span> will clear out unused honses and throw 
away all currently memoized results, but only if fewer than <span class="v">n</span> bytes of 
memory are currently free.  If more than <span class="v">n</span> bytes are free, it does 
nothing.</p> 
 
<p>The general idea here is that garbage collection is slow, so you only want 
to do it if you are starting to run out of memory.  At the same time, garbage 
collection is cheaper if you can do it "in between" computations that are 
creating a lot of garbage, where there are fewer live objects.  Moreover, if 
you still have a lot of memory still available, then you may prefer to keep 
currently memoized results so that you aren't repeating work.</p> 
 
<p>You can use <span class="v">maybe-wash-memory</span> in between computations to trigger 
garbage collections in an opportunistic way: if there's ample memory still 
available, no GC will be triggered, but if memory is getting scarce, then it's 
time to trigger an expensive collection, wiping out the memo tables and 
cleaning up honses in the process.</p> 
 
<p>Here's a basic example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/misc/memory-mgmt" :dir :system) ;; adds ttag
(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> (<a href="ACL2____SET-MAX-MEM.html">set-max-mem</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 8 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 30))))           ;; 8 GB
... some memory intensive stuff ...
(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> (<a href="ACL2____MAYBE-WASH-MEMORY.html">maybe-wash-memory</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 3 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 30))))
... more memory intensive stuff ...
(<a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a> (<a href="ACL2____MAYBE-WASH-MEMORY.html">maybe-wash-memory</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> 3 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 30))))
... etc ...</pre> 
 
<p>If the optional <span class="v">clear</span> argument is <span class="v">t</span>, honses will be cleared using 
<a href="ACL2____HONS-CLEAR.html">hons-clear</a> instead of <a href="ACL2____HONS-WASH.html">hons-wash</a>.  (This is generally ill 
advised.)</p> 
 
<p>This can be a good way to clean up memory in between <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-PARAM-THM.html">def-gl-param-thm</a> cases, and in other situations.</p>
