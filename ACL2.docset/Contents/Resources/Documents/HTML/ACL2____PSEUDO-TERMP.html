<p>A predicate for recognizing term-like s-expressions</p><pre class="code">Example Forms:

(<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> x y '123))            ; has value t</pre> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">x</span> is the quotation of a term, then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> x)</span> is <span class="v">t</span>. 
 However, if <span class="v">x</span> is not the quotation of a term it is not necessarily the 
 case that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a> x)</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> for a discussion of the various meanings of the word 
 ``term'' in ACL2.  In its most strict sense, a term is either a legal variable 
 symbol, a quoted constant, or the application of an <span class="v">n</span>-ary function symbol 
 or closed <span class="v">lambda</span>-expression to <span class="v">n</span> terms.  By ``legal variable 
 symbol'' we exclude constant symbols, such as <span class="v">t</span>, <span class="v">nil</span>, and 
 <span class="v">*ts-rational*</span>.  By ``quoted constants'' we include <span class="v">'t</span> (aka <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a>
 t)</span>), <span class="v">'nil</span>, <span class="v">'31</span>, etc., and exclude constant names such as <span class="v">t</span>, 
 <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">*ts-rational*</span>, unquoted constants such as <span class="v">31</span> or 
 <span class="v">1/2</span>, and ill-formed <span class="v">quote</span> expressions such as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a> 3 4)</span>.  By 
 ``closed lambda expression'' we exclude expressions, such as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (x)
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x y))</span>, containing free variables in their bodies.  Terms typed by the 
 user are translated into strict terms for internal use in ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>The predicate <span class="v">termp</span> checks this strict sense of ``term'' with respect 
 to a given ACL2 logical world; See <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  Many ACL2 functions, such as 
 the rewriter, require certain of their arguments to satisfy <span class="v">termp</span>. 
 However, if regarded simply from the perspective of an effective <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> 
 for a term-processing function, <span class="v">termp</span> checks many irrelevant 
 things.  (Does it really matter that the variable symbols encountered never 
 start and end with an asterisk?)  We have therefore introduced the notion of a 
 ``pseudo-term'' and embodied it in the predicate <span class="v">pseudo-termp</span>, which is 
 easier to check, does not require the logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> as input, and is 
 often perfectly suitable as a <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> on term-processing functions.</p> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">pseudo-termp</span> is either a symbol, a true list of length 2 beginning 
 with the word <span class="v">quote</span>, the application of an <span class="v">n</span>-ary pseudo-<span class="v">lambda</span> 
 expression to a true list of <span class="v">n</span> pseudo-terms, or the application of a 
 symbol to a true list of <span class="v">n</span> <span class="v">pseudo-termp</span>s.  By an ``<span class="v">n</span>-ary 
 pseudo-<span class="v">lambda</span> expression'' we mean an expression of the form <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a>
 (v1 ... vn) pterm)</span>, where the <span class="v">vi</span> are symbols (but not necessarily 
 distinct legal variable symbols) and <span class="v">pterm</span> is a <span class="v">pseudo-termp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Metafunctions may use <span class="v">pseudo-termp</span> as a <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>.</p>
