<p>Fixtype of symbol values.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>package  <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>name  <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>Conceptually, a symbol consists of a package name and a (symbol) name.</p><p>We do not use the fixtype of the ACL2 symbols here 
     (i.e. the fixtype for the built-in recognizer <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a></span>), 
     because that type only contains symbols with known package names. 
     Here instead we are formalizing 
     the ACL2 programming language at the meta level, 
     and therefore we must be able to talk about 
     all possible symbols for different collections of known packages.</p><p>We use any strings as package names, 
     even though there are restrictions on package names (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span>). 
     These restrictions may be formalized elsewhere.</p>
