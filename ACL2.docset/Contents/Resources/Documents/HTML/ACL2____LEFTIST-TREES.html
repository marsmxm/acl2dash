<p>An implementation of Leftist Trees.</p><p>Leftist trees are an efficient implementation of binary 
  heaps. Regular 
 (completely balanced) binary heaps are tricky, and in most cases near 
 impossible, to implement in functional languages because of the need for 
 constant-time access to the last element in the tree (that element being the 
 node in the bottom-most level of the tree, furthest to the right). Leftist 
 trees avoid this by replacing this "balanced" requirement with the 
 requirement that the right-most spine of the tree be small relative to the 
 overal number of elements in the tree. Since the fundamental heap operations 
 (insert, delete-min) only recur on the right spine of the tree in question, 
 this guarantees that these operations are O(log(n)), where n is the size of 
 the tree.</p> 
 
 <p>Leftist trees look like this:</p> 
 
 <p>(rank root left right)</p> 
 
 <p>where "rank" is defined to be the length of the right spine of the tree, 
 "root" is the root element of the tree, "left" is the left sub-tree, and 
 "right" is the right sub-tree.</p> 
 
 <p>Leftist trees are heap-ordered, and they are "balanced" in a loose 
 sense. In particular, the size of the tree is at least as big as an 
 exponential function of the rank:</p> 
 
 <p>size(tree) &gt;= 2^(rank(tree)) - 1,</p> 
 
 <p>or, solving for rank(tree) and noting that the rank is always an 
 integer,</p> 
 
 <p>rank(tree) &lt;= floor(log(size(tree) + 1)).</p> 
 
 <p>The important tree operations are INSERT-LT, FIND-MIN-LT, and 
 DELETE-MIN-LT. A useful function called BUILD-LT is also provided, which 
 constructs a leftist tree from a list. An important constant is *EMPTY-LT*, 
 which is the empty tree (for this implementation, just NIL).</p> 
 
 <p>To learn how to use the trees, see :DOC LEFTIST-TREE-FNS. To see some 
 useful theorems about leftist trees, including the rank bound above, see :DOC 
 LEFTIST-TREE-THMS.</p>
