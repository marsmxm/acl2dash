<p>Suggested Inductions in the Associativity of App Example</p><p>To find a plausible induction argument, the system studies the 
 recursions exhibited by the terms in the conjecture.</p> 
 
 <p>Roughly speaking, a call of a recursive function ``suggests'' an induction 
 if the argument position decomposed in recursion is occupied by a 
 variable.</p> 
 
 <p>In this conjecture, three terms suggest inductions:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(app <b>a</b> b) 
 
(app <b>b</b> c) 
 
(app <b>a</b> (app b c)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The variable recursively decomposed is indicated in <b>bold</b>.</p>
