<p>Representation of Verilog expressions.</p><p>One goal of our expression representation was for the recursive 
structure of expressions to be as simple as possible.  More specifically, I did 
not want to have a different representation for a unary expression than for a 
binary expression, etc.  Instead, I just wanted each operator to take a list of 
arguments, each of which were themselves valid subexpressions.</p> 
 
<h3>Basic Terminology</h3> 
 
<h5>Atomic Expressions</h5> 
 
<p>The atomic expressions are recognized by <a href="VL2014____VL-ATOM-P.html">vl-atom-p</a>.  Each 
atomic expression includes some <b>guts</b>, which refer to either an:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-ID-P.html">vl-id-p</a>: a simple, non-hierarchical identifier,</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-CONSTINT-P.html">vl-constint-p</a>: an integer literal with no X or Z bits,</li> 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-WEIRDINT-P.html">vl-weirdint-p</a>: an integer literal with some X or Z bits,</li> 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-EXTINT-P.html">vl-extint-p</a>: an unbased, unsized integer literal like <span class="v">'0</span> or 
<span class="v">'x</span>,</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-REAL-P.html">vl-real-p</a>: a "real literal", i.e., a floating point number,</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-STRING-P.html">vl-string-p</a>: a string literal,</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-TIME-P.html">vl-time-p</a>: time literals like <span class="v">3ns</span>,</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-KEYGUTS-P.html">vl-keyguts-p</a>: special atomic expressions like <span class="v">null</span>, <span class="v">this</span>, 
<span class="v">super</span>, <span class="v">$</span>, <span class="v">local</span>, etc.</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-HIDPIECE-P.html">vl-hidpiece-p</a>: one piece of a hierarchical identifier,</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-FUNNAME-P.html">vl-funname-p</a>: the name of an ordinary function, or</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-SYSFUNNAME-P.html">vl-sysfunname-p</a>: the name of a system function (e.g., 
<span class="v">$display</span>).</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-BASICTYPE-P.html">vl-basictype-p</a>: simple type names like <span class="v">byte</span>, <span class="v">shortint</span>, 
<span class="v">time</span>, <span class="v">logic</span>, etc.</li> 
 
<li>
<a href="VL2014____VL-TAGNAME-P.html">vl-tagname-p</a>: the name of a tagged union type member.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Some of these are probably not things you would ordinarily think of as 
atomic expressions.  However, accepting them as atomic expressions lets us 
achieve the straightforward recursive structure we desire.</p> 
 
<p>In addition to their guts, each <a href="VL2014____VL-ATOM-P.html">vl-atom-p</a> includes a</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">finalwidth</span>, which is a <a href="ACL2____MAYBE-NATP.html">maybe-natp</a> and</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">finaltype</span>, which is a <a href="VL2014____VL-MAYBE-EXPRTYPE-P.html">vl-maybe-exprtype-p</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Typically, when we have just parsed the modules, these fields are left 
<span class="v">nil</span>: their values are only filled in during our expression typing and 
sizing computations.</p> 
 
<p>Finally, an atom has <span class="v">atts</span>, which is a <a href="VL2014____VL-ATTS-P.html">vl-atts-p</a>.  These 
attributes are generally <span class="v">nil</span> upon parsing since the Verilog or 
SystemVerilog grammars don't really provide anywhere for <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> foo = bar, baz
*)</span> style attributes to be attached to atomic expressions.  However, we 
occasionally find it convenient to put our own attributes on atoms, e.g., it 
allows us to record that a particular atom came from a parameter.</p> 
 
<h5>Non-Atomic Expressions</h5> 
 
<p>A non-atomic expression represents an operator being applied to some 
arguments.</p> 
 
<p>Like atomic expressions, each <span class="v">vl-nonatom-p</span> includes <span class="v">finalwidth</span> and 
<span class="v">finaltype</span> fields, which are <span class="v">nil</span> upon parsing and may later be filled 
in by our expression typing and sizing computations.</p> 
 
<p>Additionally, each non-atomic expression includes:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">op</span>, the operation being applied.  For structural validity, <span class="v">op</span> 
must be one of the known operators found in <a href="VL2014_____A2VL-OPS-TABLE_A2.html">*vl-ops-table*</a>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">args</span>, the arguments the operation is being applied to.  No structural 
constraints are imposed upon <span class="v">args</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">atts</span>, which represent any attributes written in the <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> foo = bar,
baz *)</span> style that Verilog-2005 permits.  No structural constraints are placed 
upon <span class="v">atts</span>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h5>Valid Expressions</h5> 
 
<p>The valid expressions are recognized by <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-P.html">vl-expr-p</a>, which extends our 
basic structural checks recursively over the expression, and also ensures that 
each operator has the proper arity.</p>
