<p>User-definable pattern-matching.</p><p>Examples:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____PATTERN-MATCH.html">pattern-match</a>
 x
 ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> a b) ... body1 ... )
 ((three-elt-constructor a &amp; c) ... body2 ...)
 (&amp; default-value))</pre> 
 
<p><span class="v">pm</span> is a convenient abbreviation for <span class="v">pattern-match</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Pattern-match is similar to <a href="ACL2____CASE-MATCH.html">case-match</a>, but the two macros interpret 
patterns differently.  If the pattern is <span class="v">(a b c)</span>, <span class="v">case-match</span> 
interprets this as a three-element list and, if the input is also a 
three-element list, binds the first to <span class="v">a</span>, second to <span class="v">b</span>, and third to 
<span class="v">c</span>.  Pattern-match, on the other hand, interprets <span class="v">(a b c)</span> as the 
application of a constructor <span class="v">a</span> to arguments <span class="v">b</span> and <span class="v">c</span>.  Aside from 
this difference, pattern-match contains much the same features as case-match. 
See <a href="ACL2____CASE-MATCH.html">case-match</a> for the significance of special characters such as <span class="v">&amp;</span> 
and <span class="v">!</span>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____PATTERN-MATCH-LIST.html">pattern-match-list</a>, <a href="ACL2____PATTERN-MATCHES.html">pattern-matches</a>, and 
<a href="ACL2____PATTERN-MATCHES-LIST.html">pattern-matches-list</a>.</p> 
 
<h3>Usage</h3> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____PATTERN-MATCH.html">pattern-match</a>
   input
   (pattern1 declare-form condition11 condition12 ... declare-form body1)
   (pattern2 condition21 condition22 ... body2)
    ...)</pre> 
 
<p>In the previous invocation, pattern-match first matches the input to 
pattern1.  If it matches, condition11, condition12, ... are evaluated using any 
variable bindings that pattern1 created, and using the declare form preceding 
them if there is one.  (The declare form is primarily useful for declaring 
ignored variables.)  If they all evaluate to non-nil, body1 is evaluated and 
returned with the same variable bindings and with the declare form preceding 
it, if any.  If pattern1 does not match or any of the conditions evaluate to 
nil, body1 is not evaluated and pattern2 is tried, and so on.  The list of 
patterns should be comprehensive or else end with a listing of the form <span class="v">(&amp;
finalbody)</span>, so that finalbody serves as a default value.</p> 
 
<p>In each pattern clause the declare forms and conditions are optional. 
Conditions may be included without declare forms and vice versa.  To 
distinguish declare forms from conditions we simply check whether the first 
item following the pattern and/or the last item before the body are declare 
forms; everything between the pattern and body that is not a declare form is 
assumed to be a condition.</p> 
 
<p>Each pattern may be a variable, to be bound to the value of the input; an 
existing variable name prefixed by ! or a constant, the value of which is to be 
compared with the input value; the special symbol <span class="v">&amp;</span> which matches 
anything, or an application of a constructor to a number of arguments.  Each 
constructor must have an associated macro which allows pattern-match to process 
it.  The macro defines what is acceptable syntax, i.e. the number and type of 
arguments the constructor can take, the conditions under which the input 
matches the constructor, and the significance of the arguments.  For example, 
cons-pattern-matcher is defined so that in a pattern match statement, the 
constructor cons is required to take exactly two arguments; it matches any 
input satisfying (consp input), and its arguments are treated as subpatterns to 
be matched to the car and cdr of the input, respectively.</p> 
 
<h3>Extensions</h3> 
 
<p>The pattern-match book includes built-in support for the constructors 
<span class="v">cons</span>, <span class="v">list</span>, and <span class="v">list*</span>.  Support may be added for user-defined 
constructors.  Some ``special constructors'' are also supported, with less 
obvious behavior. <span class="v">raw</span> takes one argument, which is matched to the input 
using case-match syntax; that is, no constructors are recognized.  <span class="v">bind</span> 
takes two arguments, one a variable symbol and one a pattern; if the pattern 
matches the input, then the input is bound to the variable.  <span class="v">any</span> compares 
the input to each of its arguments using equal; if any of the arguments are 
equal to the input then it is considered a match. <span class="v">force</span> assumes that the 
pattern matches and makes the specified bindings without checking.</p> 
 
<p>For example, the following pattern-match statement returns <span class="v">(1 ((1 2
. 3)))</span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____PATTERN-MATCH.html">pattern-match</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> 2 3)))
  ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> a (bind k (raw ((a b . c))))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a k)))</pre> 
 
<p>For documentation on enabling pattern-match to recognize new constructors, 
see <a href="ACL2____DEF-PATTERN-MATCH-CONSTRUCTOR.html">def-pattern-match-constructor</a> and for more see <a href="ACL2____CONSTRUCTOR-PATTERN-MATCH-MACROS.html">constructor-pattern-match-macros</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Note 1: Currently pattern-match does not bind the input expression to an 
internal variable, but simply copies it everywhere it is used.  Therefore it is 
wise, if the input is from some expensive calculation, to bind it to a variable 
before applying pattern-match.</p> 
 
<p>Note 2: The default value of a pattern-match expression in case no patterns 
match is nil.  Because of this, if the pattern-match expression is supposed to 
evaluate to a special shape (an mv, or state, for instance), a default value of 
the correct shape must be defined by including a final clause of the form <span class="v">(&amp;
default-value-of-correct-shape)</span>.</p>
