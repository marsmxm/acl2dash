<p>Parsing failure propagation theorems 
          for the parser of ABNF grammars.</p><p>If certain parsing functions fail, 
     other parsing functions fail as well, 
     because the former parse prefixes of the latter. 
     In other words, parsing failures ``propagate''.</p><p>The parsing failure propagation theorems below state this kind of facts. 
     These theorems are used as rewrite rules in the <a href="ABNF____GRAMMAR-PARSER-COMPLETENESS.html">completeness theorems</a> and in the <a href="ABNF____GRAMMAR-PARSER-DISAMBIGUATION.html">disambiguation theorems</a>. The parsing failure propagation theorems are disabled by default; 
     they are enabled in the completeness and disambiguation theorems 
     that use them.</p>
