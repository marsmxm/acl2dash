<p>Closure in ABNF grammars.</p><p>A rule's definiens may reference (i.e. ``call'') other rules. 
     Those rules may in turn call further rules, 
     and so on until a ``closed'' set of rules is reached.</p><p>When grammars are modularly defined, a grammar may not be closed, 
     but after the modules are composed into one grammar for parsing, 
     the resulting grammar should be closed. 
     When composing grammars, sometimes only a portion of a grammar is selected, 
     consisting of a subset of its rules (perhaps called by other grammars) 
     along with their closure.</p>
