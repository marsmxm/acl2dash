<p>Equivalence relation on tame functions</p><p><span class="v">Fn-equal</span> is an equivalence relation on tame functions.  It 
  holds between <span class="v">fn1</span> and <span class="v">fn2</span> iff both are tame functions and 
  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> fn1 args)</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> fn2 args)</span>, for all <span class="v">args</span>.  A 
  <span class="v">defun-sk</span> event is used to express the universally quantified condition. 
  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span> proves that <span class="v">fn-equal</span> is a congruence relation for 
  every argument position of ilk <span class="v">:FN</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>Ideally one can substitute one functional object for an equivalent one in 
  functional positions.  For example, <span class="v">fn-equal</span> holds between 
  <span class="tt">'(LAMBDA (X) X)</span> and <span class="tt">'IDENTITY</span>, so one would hold that 
  <span class="tt">(collect$ '(LAMBDA (X) X) lst)</span> could be rewritten to <span class="tt">(collect$ 
  'IDENTITY lst)</span> since the first argument of <span class="v">collect$</span> (as defined in 
  the <a href="ACL2____INTRODUCTION-TO-APPLY_42.html">introduction-to-apply$</a>) has ilk <span class="v">:FN</span>.  Unfortunately, because 
  these are quoted constants, ACL2's rewriter will not rewrite one to the 
  other!</p> 
 
  <p>We regard <span class="v">fn-equal</span> as a reminder to us — or a challenge to 
  users!  — to find a way to handle functional equivalence in the 
  rewriter.</p>
