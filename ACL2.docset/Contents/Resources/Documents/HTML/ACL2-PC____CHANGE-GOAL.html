<p>(primitive) 
change to another goal.</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(change-goal (main . 1)) -- change to the goal (main . 1)
change-goal              -- change to the next-to-top goal

General Form:
(change-goal &amp;optional goal-name end-flg)</pre> 
 
 <p>Change to the goal with the name <span class="v">goal-name</span>, i.e. make it the current 
 goal.  However, if <span class="v">goal-name</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> or is not supplied, then it 
 defaults to the next-to-top goal, i.e., the second goal in the stack of goals. 
 If <span class="v">end-flg</span> is supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>, then move the current goal to 
 the end of the goal stack; else merely swap it with the next-to-top goal.
