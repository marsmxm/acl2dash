<p>Print readably to the comment window</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> for important background.</p> 
 
 <p>This is nearly the same as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT-TO-COMMENT-WINDOW.html">fmt-to-comment-window</a></span>, but 
 <span class="v">fmt-to-comment-window!</span> avoids inserting backslash (\) characters when 
 forced to print past the right margin.  Use <span class="v">fmt-to-comment-window!</span> if you 
 want to be able to read the forms back in.</p>
