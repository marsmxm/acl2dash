<p>Create a user-level form that reflects a given user-level form's 
 structure.</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> for relevant background about user-level ``terms'' 
 and actual ``translated'' terms.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____DIRECTED-UNTRANSLATE.html">directed-untranslate</a> uterm tterm sterm iff-flg stobjs-out wrld)</pre> 
 
 <p>where:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">uterm</span> is an untranslated form that translates to the term, 
 <span class="v">tterm</span>;</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">sterm</span> is a term, which might share a lot of structure with 
 <span class="v">tterm</span> (we may think of <span class="v">sterm</span> as a simplified version of 
 <span class="v">tterm</span>);</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">iff-flg</span> is a Boolean;</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">stobjs-out</span> is either <span class="v">nil</span> or a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></span> each of whose 
 members is either <span class="v">nil</span> or the name of a <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>, with no stobj name 
 repeated; and</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">wrld</span> is a logical <span class="v">world</span>, typically <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state)</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The result is an untranslated form whose translation is provably equal to 
 <span class="v">sterm</span>, except that if <span class="v">iff-flg</span> is true then these need only be 
 Boolean equivalent rather than equal.  The goal is that the shared structure 
 between <span class="v">tterm</span> and <span class="v">sterm</span> is reflected in similar sharing between 
 <span class="v">uterm</span> and the result.  If <span class="v">stobjs-out</span> is not <span class="v">nil</span>, then an 
 attempt is made to produce a result with multiple-value return, whose i-th 
 element is an ordinary value or a stobj, <span class="v">st</span>, according to whether the 
 i-th element of <span class="v">stobjs-out</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> or <span class="v">st</span>, respectively.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Example Form:

 <p>The returned value from the example above is:</p>

 <p>Compare this with the value returned by calling the system function 
 <span class="v">untranslate</span> instead on the final three arguments:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____UNTRANSLATE.html">untranslate</a> '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> a2 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> b2 c2 'nil) 'nil) nil (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))

 <p>The original structure of the given ``uterm'', <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> a (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> b c nil))</span>, 
 has been preserved by <span class="v">directed-untranslate</span>, but not by <span class="v">untranslate</span>. 
 Thus, <span class="v">directed-untranslate</span> may be particularly useful when a given form, 
 <span class="v">uterm</span>, translates to a term, <span class="v">tterm</span>, which in turn simplifies to a 
 related term, <span class="v">sterm</span>, and your goal is to untranslate <span class="v">sterm</span> in a way 
 that preserves structure from <span class="v">uterm</span>.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remarks</b>.</p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">directed-untranslate</span> utility is based on heuristics that may not 
 always produce the result you want.  They have been designed to work best in 
 the case that <span class="v">sterm</span> is a simplification of <span class="v">tterm</span>.</li> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>For an example of the heuristics, suppose that <span class="v">uterm</span> let-binds a 
 variable, <span class="v">v</span>, which thus is <a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a>-bound in <span class="v">tterm</span> to some 
 expression, <span class="v">expr</span>.  If <span class="v">v</span> has essentially been replaced by a value 
 <span class="v">expr'</span> that occurs in <span class="v">sterm</span>, then an attempt is often made to use 
 lambda abstraction to let-bind <span class="v">v</span> to <span class="v">expr'</span> in the result.  (No such 
 attempt is made if <span class="v">expr</span> has essentially disappeared in <span class="v">sterm</span>.)  The 
 utility, <span class="v">directed-untranslate-no-lets</span>, is similar but does not make such 
 an attempt.</li> 
 
 <li>For another example, results involving <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a></span> are biased towards the 
 intended primary use case, in which sterm is a simplification of tterm and the 
 result is intended to be in simplified form.  In particular, bindings of the 
 form <span class="v">(var val)</span> that specify an ignored or ignorable variable are handled 
 as follows. 
 
 <ul> 
 
  <li>A <span class="v">b*</span> binding <span class="tt">(- val)</span> in <span class="v">uterm</span> translates to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a>
  val ...)</span>, so is generally preserved if there is a corresponding <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a></span> call in <span class="v">sterm</span>.</li> 
 
  <li>A <span class="v">b*</span> binding of <span class="v">(&amp; val)</span> or <span class="v">(?!x val)</span> in <span class="v">uterm</span> is 
  completely discarded in translation to <span class="v">tterm</span>, so is presumably not 
  present in <span class="v">sterm</span>, hence is also discarded in the result.</li> 
 
  <li>A <span class="v">b*</span> binding <span class="v">(?x val)</span> in <span class="v">uterm</span> generates an <span class="v">ignorable</span> 
  declaration, so is generally preserved if and only if <span class="v">x</span> occurs free in 
  <span class="v">sterm</span>.  (If the binding were restored after being simplified away, it 
  could contain an unsimplified term, which we deem to be undesirable.)</li> 
 
 </ul>
</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">Directed-untranslate</span> may be improved over time; hence it may produce 
 different results as the tool uses increasingly sophisticated heuristics.  For 
 example, here are some features that are not yet implemented but might be in 
 the future, quite possibly only upon request. 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>A better untranslation might be obtainable when the simplified 
 term (<span class="v">sterm</span>) has similar structure to a proper subterm of the original 
 term (<span class="v">tterm</span>).  As it stands now, the original untranslated term <span class="v">uterm</span> 
 is probably useless in that case.</li> 
 
 <li>More macros could quite reasonably be handled, but aren't yet, such as 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CASE.html">case</a></span>.</li> 
 
 <li>Support for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a></span> may be improved by comprehending more binders.</li> 
 
 </ul>
</li> 
 
 </ol>
