<p>Limiting the effort expended on relieving hypotheses</p><p>Before ACL2 can apply a rule with hypotheses, it must establish 
 that the hypotheses are true.  (We ignore the relaxing of this requirement 
 afforded by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a></span>s and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>d hypotheses.)  ACL2 
 typically establishes each hypothesis by backchaining â€” instantiating 
 the hypothesis and then rewriting it recursively.  Here we describe how ACL2 
 allows the user to limit backchaining.  At the end, below, we describe the 
 function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Each hypothesis of a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>, or 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule is assigned a backchain-limit when the rule is 
 stored.  By default, this limit is <span class="v">nil</span>, denoting infinity (no limit). 
 However, the value used for the default may be set to a non-negative integer 
 (or to <span class="v">nil</span>) by the user; see <a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-default-backchain-limit</a>.  The 
 default is overridden when a <span class="v">:backchain-limit-lst</span> is supplied explicitly 
 with the rule; see <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>.  The number of recursive applications 
 of backchaining starting with the hypothesis of a rule is limited to the 
 backchain-limit associated with that hypothesis.</p> 
 
 <p>Moreover, the user may set global backchain-limits that limit the total 
 backchaining depth.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-backchain-limit</a>.  One limit is for the use 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rules, while the other 
 limit is for so-called ``<a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> reasoning'', which uses rules of 
 class <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules.  The two limits operate independently. 
 Below, we discuss the first kind of backchain limits, i.e., for other than 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules, except as otherwise indicated; but the 
 mechanism for those rules is similar.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we lay out the precise sense in which a global backchain-limit 
 interacts with the backchain-limits of individual rules in order to limit 
 backchaining.  But first we note that when further backchaining is disallowed, 
 ACL2 can still prove a hypothesis in a given context by using that contextual 
 information.  In fact, <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> reasoning may be used (except that a 
 weaker version of it is used in the second case above, i.e., where we are 
 already doing type-set reasoning).  Thus, the relieving of hypotheses may be 
 limited to the use of contextual information (without backchaining, i.e., 
 without recursively rewriting hypotheses) by executing <span class="v">:set-backchain-limit
 0</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Recall that there are two sorts of backchain limits: those applied to 
 hypotheses of individual rules, as assigned by their <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span> or else taken from the default (see <a href="ACL2____SET-DEFAULT-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-default-backchain-limit</a>); and the global limit, initially <span class="v">nil</span> (no 
 limit) but settable with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-backchain-limit</a></span>.  Here is how these 
 two types of limits interact to limit backchaining, i.e., recursive rewriting 
 of hypotheses.  ACL2 maintains a current backchain limit, which is the limit 
 on the depth of recursive calls to the rewriter, as well as a current 
 backchain depth, which is initially 0 and is incremented each time ACL2 
 backchains (and is decremented when a backchain completes).  When ACL2 begins 
 to rewrite a literal (crudely, one of the ``top-level'' terms of the goal 
 currently being worked on), it sets the current backchain-limit to the global 
 value, which is initially <span class="v">nil</span> but can be set using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">set-backchain-limit</a></span>.  When ACL2 is preparing to relieve a hypothesis by 
 backchaining (hence, after it has already tried type-set reasoning), it first 
 makes sure that the current backchain limit is greater than the current 
 backchain depth.  If not, then it refuses to relieve that hypothesis. 
 Otherwise, it increments the current backchain depth and calculates a new 
 current backchain-limit by taking the minimum of two values: the existing 
 current backchain-limit, and the sum of the current backchain depth and the 
 backchain-limit associated with the hypothesis.  Thus, ACL2 only modifies the 
 current backchain-limit if it is necessary to decrease that limit in order to 
 respect the backchain limit associated with the hypothesis.</p> 
 
 <p>We illustrate with the following examples.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; We stub out some functions so that we can reason about them.

(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p0 (x) t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p1 (x) t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p2 (x) t)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTUB.html">defstub</a> p3 (x) t)

; Initially, the default-backchain-limit is nil, or infinite.

(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> p2-implies-p1-limitless
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p2 x)
           (p1 x)))

; The following rule will have a backchain-limit of 0.

(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> p1-implies-p0-limit-0
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p1 x)
           (p0 x))
  :rule-classes ((:rewrite :backchain-limit-lst 0)))

; We have (p2 x) ==&gt; (p1 x) ==&gt; (p0 x).  We wish to establish that
; (p2 x) ==&gt; (p0 x).  Normally, this would be no problem, but here
; we fail because ACL2 cannot establish (p0 x) by type-set reasoning
; alone.

(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a>
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p2 x)
           (p0 x)))

; We set the default-backchain-limit (for rewriting) to 1.

:set-default-backchain-limit 1

; The following is more powerful than p1-implies-p0-limit-0
; because it can use rewrite rules to establish (p1 x).

(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> p1-implies-p0-limit-1
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p1 x)
           (p0 x)))

; This theorem will succeed:

(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a>
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p2 x)
           (p0 x)))

; We return the default-backchain-limit to its initial value.

:set-default-backchain-limit nil

; Here is our last axiom.

(<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> p3-implies-p2-limitless
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p3 x)
           (p2 x)))

; We now have (p3 x) ==&gt; (p2 x) ==&gt; (p1 x) ==&gt; (p0 x).  However the
; rule p1-implies-p0-limit-1 has a backchain-limit of 1; hence we
; are not allowed to backchain far enough back to use
; p3-implies-p2-limitless.  We therefore lose.

(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> will-fail
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (p3 x)
           (p0 x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Finally, we remark that to see the current global backchain-limits, issue 
 the following commands.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> wrld :ts) ; backchain limit for type-set reasoning
(<a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> wrld :rewrite) ; backchain limit for rewriting</pre>
