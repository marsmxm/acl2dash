</dl><h4>General Form (from Verilog-2005)</h4> 
 
            <pre class="code">begin [ : &lt;name&gt; &lt;declarations&gt; ]
  &lt;statements&gt;
end

fork [ : &lt;name&gt; &lt;declarations&gt; ]
  &lt;statements&gt;
join</pre> 
 
            <p>See Section 9.8.  The difference between the two kinds of blocks 
            is that in a <span class="v">begin/end</span> block, statements are to be executed in 
            order, whereas in a <span class="v">fork/join</span> block, statements are executed 
            simultaneously.</p> 
 
            <p>A further remark is that "Block names give a means of uniquely 
            identifying all variables at any simulation time." This seems to 
            suggest that one might try to flatten all of the declarations in a 
            module by, e.g., prepending the block name to each variable 
            name.</p> 
 
            <p>With regards to declarations: "All variables shall be static; 
            that is, a unique location exists for all variables, and leaving or 
            entering blocks shall not affect the values stored in them."</p> 
 
            <h4>SystemVerilog-2012 Extensions</h4> 
 
            <p>In Verilog-2005 only blocks that are named can have local 
            declarations.  SystemVerilog drops this restriction and allows 
            declarations even in unnamed blocks.</p> 
 
            <p>SystemVerilog also allows the label to occur before the 
            <span class="v">begin</span> or <span class="v">fork</span> keyword, and, more generally, allows labels 
            to be added to other kinds of statements.  For instance, you can 
            write:</p> 
 
            <pre class="code">update_foo: foo = foo + bar;</pre> 
 
            <p>We turn labels like this into named begin/end blocks that 
            surround their statement.</p> 
 
            <p>Note that it's not legal to label a block both before and after 
            the begin keyword.  See SystemVerilog-2012 Section 9.3.5, Statement 
            Labels, on page 178.</p> 
 
            <p>SystemVerilog also adds different kinds of <span class="v">join</span> keywords, 
            which we now represent as part of the block's type.</p>
