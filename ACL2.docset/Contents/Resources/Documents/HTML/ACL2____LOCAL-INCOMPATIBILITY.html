<p>When non-local <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> won't replay in isolation</p><p>Sometimes a ``<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> incompatibility'' is reported while 
 attempting to embed some <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, as in an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  This is generally due to the use of a locally defined name in 
 a non-local event or the failure to make a witnessing definition <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">Local</a></span> incompatibilities may be detected while trying to execute the 
 strictly non-local <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> of an embedding.  For example, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> operates by first executing all the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> (<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> 
 and non-local) with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> <span class="v">nil</span>, to confirm that they are 
 all admissible.  Then it attempts merely to assume the non-local ones to 
 create the desired theory, by executing the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> set to <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  Similarly, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> assumes the non-local ones, with the understanding that a 
 previously successful <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> has performed the admissibility 
 check.</p> 
 
 <p>How can a sequence of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> admitted with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> 
 <span class="v">nil</span> fail when <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a></span> is <span class="v">'</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>?  The 
 key observation is that in the latter case only the non-local <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> 
 are processed.  The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> ones are skipped and so the non-local ones 
 must not depend upon them.</p> 
 
 <p>Two typical mistakes are suggested by the detection of a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> 
 incompatibility: (1) a locally defined function or macro was used in a 
 non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> event (and, in the case of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, was not 
 included among the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s) and (2) the witnessing definition of a 
 function that was included among the <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> was not made <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>An example of mistake (1) would be to include among your <a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>d <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> both a local definition of <span class="v">f</span> and a non-local 
 theorem about <span class="v">f</span>, for example as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> ()
  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x) x))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (x) x)

  (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> f-is-g (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f x) (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x)))
  )</pre> 
 
 <p>In this case, either the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> should be made <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> or, if 
 we want to export the <span class="v">defthm</span>, then the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> of <span class="v">f</span> should be 
 made non-local.</p> 
 
 <p>An example of mistake (2) would be to include <span class="v">((fn *) =&gt; *)</span> among your 
 <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s and then to write <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> fn (x) ...)</span> in your <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>, instead of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> fn ...))</span>, as shown in the example 
 below.  In essence, this is an error because <span class="v">fn</span> is exported twice: once 
 by the signature and once by the <span class="v">defun</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
  ( ((fn *) =&gt; *) )

  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> fn (x) x)
  )</pre> 
 
 <p>One subtle aspect of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> is that if you constrain any 
 member of a mutually recursive clique you must define the entire clique 
 locally and then you must constrain those members of it you want axiomatized 
 non-locally.</p> 
 
 <p>Errors due to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> incompatibility should never occur in the 
 assumption of a fully certified book.  Certification ensures against it. 
 Therefore, if <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> reports an incompatibility, we assert that 
 earlier in the processing of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> a warning was printed 
 advising you that some book was uncertified.  If this is not the case — 
 if <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> reports an incompatibility and there has been no prior 
 warning about lack of certification — please report it to us.</p> 
 
 <p>When a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> incompatibility is detected, we roll-back to the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> in which we started the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>. 
 That is, we discard the intermediate <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> created by trying to process 
 the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> skipping proofs.  This is clean, but we realize it is very 
 frustrating because the entire sequence of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> must be processed 
 from scratch.  Assuming that the embedded <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> were, once upon a 
 time, processed as top-level <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s (after all, at some point you 
 managed to create this sequence of <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a>s so that the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> 
 and non-local ones together could survive a pass in which proofs were done), 
 it stands to reason that we could define a predicate that would determine 
 then, before you attempted to embed them, if <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> incompatibilities 
 exist.  We hope to do that, eventually.</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude with a subtle example of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> incompatibility.  The 
 problem is that in order for <span class="v">foo-type-prescription</span> to be admitted using 
 the specified <span class="v">:typed-term</span> <span class="v">(foo x)</span>, the conclusion <span class="v">(my-natp (foo
 x))</span> depends on <span class="v">my-natp</span> being a <a href="ACL2____COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a>.  This is 
 fine on the first pass of the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>, during which lemma 
 <span class="v">my-natp-cr</span> is admitted.  But <span class="v">my-natp-cr</span> is skipped on the second 
 pass because it is marked <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>, and this causes 
 <span class="v">foo-type-prescription</span> to fail on the second pass.</p>
