 <p>Note that the <span class="v">IF</span> expression above is the simplified body of <span class="v">APP</span>. 
 But we know the test <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> A)</span> is true, by the first hypothesis.  Click 
 on the link above to replace the test by <span class="v">T</span>.  Actually this step and 
 several subsequent ones are done during the simplification of the body of 
 <span class="v">APP</span> but we want to illustrate the basic principles of simplification 
 without bothering with every detail.</p>
