<p>Book naming conventions assumed by ACL2</p><p>For this discussion we assume that the resident operating system is 
 Unix (trademark of AT&amp;T), but analogous remarks apply to other operating 
 systems supported by ACL2; see <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 defines a ``full book name'' to be an ``absolute filename string,'' 
 that may be divided into contiguous sections: a ``directory string'', a 
 ``familiar name'' and an ``extension''.  See <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a> for the 
 definitions of ``absolute,'' ``filename string,'' and other notions pertaining 
 to naming files.  Below we exhibit the three sections of one such string:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">"/usr/home/smith/project/arith.lisp"

"/usr/home/smith/project/"           ; directory string
                        "arith"      ; familiar name
                             ".lisp" ; extension</pre> 
 
 <p>The sections are marked by the rightmost slash and rightmost dot, as shown 
 below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">"/usr/home/smith/project/arith.lisp"
                        |     |
                        slash dot
                        |     |
"/usr/home/smith/project/"           ; directory string
                        "arith"      ; familiar name
                             ".lisp" ; extension</pre> 
 
 <p>The directory string includes (and terminates with) the rightmost slash. 
 The extension includes (and starts with) the rightmost dot.  The dot must be 
 strictly to the right of the slash so that the familiar name is well-defined 
 and nonempty.</p> 
 
 <p>If you are using ACL2 on a system in which file names do not have this 
 form, please contact the authors and we'll see what we can do about 
 generalizing ACL2's conventions.</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude with a remark about a representation of full book names that is 
 used in <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> files and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> expansions.  When the 
 system books directory is a prefix of a full book name, ACL2 may choose to 
 write a full book name as <span class="v">(:system . "suffix")</span>, where <span class="v">"suffix"</span> 
 is the result of removing the system books directory from the front of the 
 full book name.  Here is an example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; full book name:
"/Users/smith/acl2/acl2/books/std/portcullis.lisp"

; alternate representation
; (where "/Users/smith/acl2/acl2/books/" is the system books directory):
(:SYSTEM . "std/portcullis.lisp")</pre> 
 
 <p>Conversely, in some contexts ACL2 will convert <span class="v">:system . "suffix"</span> to 
 an absolute pathname.  Generally <span class="v">"suffix"</span> will be a relative pathname, 
 such as <span class="v">"dir/filename.lisp"</span>; in that case, the system books directory 
 will be concatenated with <span class="v">"suffix"</span> to form a corresponding full book 
 name.  However, if <span class="v">"suffix"</span> is an absolute pathname, such as 
 <span class="v">"/u/smith/foo.lisp"</span>, then the corresponding full book name is simply 
 that absolute pathname; essentially, the <span class="v">:system</span> prefix is dropped.</p>
