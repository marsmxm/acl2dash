<p>ATJ tutorial: Motivation for Generating Java Code from ACL2.</p><p>This tutorial page provides motivation for ATJ, 
    and more in general for code generators for ACL2, 
    especially in light of ACL2's code ability to run as Common Lisp code. 
    This tutorial page may be skipped at first reading, 
    especially if the reader is already motivated 
    to generate Java code from ACL2.</p><h5>Code Generation in Theorem Provers</h5><p>A benefit of writing code in a theorem prover like ACL2 
    is the ability to prove properties about it, 
    such as the satisfaction of requirements specifications. 
    A facility to generate code in one or more programming languages 
    from an executable subset of the prover's logical language 
    enables the possibly verified code to run as, and interoperate with, 
    code written in those programming languages. 
    Assuming the correctness of code generation 
    (whose verification is a separable problem, 
    akin to compilation verification) 
    the properties proved about the original code 
    carry over to the generated code.</p><p>For instance, the <a href="http://isabelle.in.tum.de" target="_blank"><nobr>Isabelle<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://isabelle.in.tum.de"></nobr></a>, <a href="https://coq.inria.fr" target="_blank"><nobr>Coq<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://coq.inria.fr"></nobr></a>, and <a href="http://pvs.csl.sri.com" target="_blank"><nobr>PVS<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://pvs.csl.sri.com"></nobr></a>, and <a href="https://hol-theorem-prover.org" target="_blank"><nobr>HOL<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://hol-theorem-prover.org"></nobr></a> theorem provers include facilities to generate code 
    in various programming languages, such as <a href="http://sml-family.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Standard ML<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://sml-family.org"></nobr></a>, <a href="https://ocaml.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Ocaml<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://ocaml.org"></nobr></a>, <a href="https://www.haskell.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Haskell<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.haskell.org"></nobr></a>, <a href="https://scala-lang.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Scala<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://scala-lang.org"></nobr></a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29" target="_blank"><nobr>C<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29"></nobr></a>, and <a href="http://www.scheme-reports.org" target="_blank"><nobr>Scheme<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.scheme-reports.org"></nobr></a>.</p><h5>Code Generation in ACL2</h5><p>ACL2's tight integration with the underlying Lisp platform 
    enables the executable subset of the ACL2 logical language 
    to run readily and efficiently as Lisp, 
    without the need for explicit code generation facilities. 
    Nonetheless, some situations may call for 
    running ACL2 code in other programming languages: 
    specifically, when the ACL2 code must interoperate 
    with external code in those programming languages 
    in a more integrated and efficient way than afforded 
    by inter-language communication via foreign function interfaces 
    such as <a href="https://common-lisp.net/project/cffi" target="_blank"><nobr>CFFI<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://common-lisp.net/project/cffi"></nobr></a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/specs/jni" target="_blank"><nobr>JNI<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/specs/jni"></nobr></a> or by inter-process communication with the ACL2/Lisp runtime 
    via mechanisms like <a href="ACL2____BRIDGE.html">the ACL2 Bridge</a>. Using Lisp implementations 
    written in the target programming languages, 
    such as <a href="https://abcl.org" target="_blank"><nobr>ABCL<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://abcl.org"></nobr></a>, involves not only porting ACL2 to them, 
    but also including much more runtime code 
    than necessary for the target applications. 
    Compilers from Lisp to the target programming languages 
    may need changes or wrappers, 
    because executable ACL2 is not quite a subset of Lisp; 
    furthermore, the ability to compile non-ACL2 Lisp code 
    is an unnecessary complication as far as ACL2 compilation is concerned, 
    making potential verification harder.</p><p>ATJ translates ACL2 to Java, 
    enabling possibly verified ACL2 code 
    to run as, and interoperate with, Java code, 
    without much of the ACL2 framework or any of the Lisp runtime.</p><p>ATJ is useful 
    to generate Java code at the end of an <a href="APT____APT.html">APT</a> program synthesis derivation.</p><p>Generators for ACL2 of code in other programming languages (than Java) 
    may be developed similarly to ATJ. 
    An example is <a href="C____ATC.html">ATC</a>, a C code generator for ACL2.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-BACKGROUND.html">Background on the Evaluation Semantics of ACL2</a></p>
