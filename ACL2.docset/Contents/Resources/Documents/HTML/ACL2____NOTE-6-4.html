<p>ACL2 Version  6.4 (January, 2014) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we roughly organize the changes to ACL2 since Version 6.3 into the 
 following categories of changes: existing features, new features, heuristic 
 improvements, bug fixes, changes at the system level, Emacs support, and 
 experimental versions.  Each change is described in just one category, though 
 of course many changes could be placed in more than one category.</p> 
 
 <p>See also <a href="ACL2____NOTE-6-4-BOOKS.html">note-6-4-books</a> for a summary of changes made to the ACL2 
 Community Books since ACL2 6.3, including the build system.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes to Existing Features</h3> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">Gag-mode</a> no longer saves prover output when <span class="v">PROVE</span> output is 
 inhibited (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>).  This may improve performance 
 slightly when certifying community books using their <span class="v">Makefile</span> or <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a>; in particular, GCL 2.6.8 running on a Mac can now certify the 
 book <span class="v">books/tau/bounders/elementary-bounders.lisp</span> without running out of 
 space, even without explicitly turning off <a href="ACL2____GAG-MODE.html">gag-mode</a> (which had been 
 done shortly before the Version 6.3 release).</p> 
 
 <p>When <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> fails to find a readable <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> 
 (<span class="v">.cert</span>) file, the error message now distinguishes between the case that 
 this file is missing and the case that read permission is missing.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) Time reporting has been improved when the host Lisp is Gnu 
 Common Lisp.  A key change was made in the computation of runtime (for 
 example, to report in event summaries), so that it includes the ``child 
 runtime''.  See <a href="ACL2____GET-INTERNAL-TIME.html">get-internal-time</a>.  Also, the utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a></span> now 
 gives improved information by including child runtime information, which can 
 be significant; for example, it probably includes compile time, while the 
 ``seconds runtime'' statistic (still) does not.  Recent versions of GCL might 
 also provide system runtime and child system runtime.  See <a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a>. 
 Thanks to Camm Maguire for suggesting these improvements to <span class="v">time$</span> and 
 providing an initial implementation for them.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in an ACL2 system function, <span class="v">our-truename</span>, which returns 
 the ``true name'' for a file name, when supplied with an optional second 
 argument.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for bringing this bug to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>The wording in theory warnings has been improved, to avoid giving the 
 impression that you are newly disabling a built-in rule in the case that it 
 merely remains disabled.</p> 
 
 <p>As requested by Sol Swords, erroneous evaluations of system function 
 <span class="v">magic-ev-fncall</span> that had produced a message, <span class="v">msg</span>, will now also 
 return that message.  The following example, sent by Sol, illustrates the fix: 
 before, evaluation of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAGIC-EV-FNCALL.html">magic-ev-fncall</a> 'cons '(a) state nil nil)</span> printed 
 a message (to the comment window) and then returned <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> t nil)</span>, but now 
 it returns <span class="v">mv t &lt;msg&gt;</span>, where <span class="v">&lt;msg&gt;</span> denotes the message (printed with 
 the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span> <span class="v">~@</span> directive).</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PBT.html">pbt</a></span> to avoid printing the bodies of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span> 
 forms.  Thanks to Jared Davis for pointing out the large output when the body 
 is a large character string.</p> 
 
 <p>A new output type, <span class="v">history</span>, now controls the printing of 
 history-related information; see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a></span>.  The unused 
 output type, <span class="v">expansion</span>, is no longer supported, i.e., is no longer a 
 member of the list <span class="v">*valid-output-names*</span>.  Because of this change, 
 printing of information when undoing, as by <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____U.html">u</a></span>, will now take 
 place even when <span class="v">event</span> output is inhibited (if <span class="v">history</span> output is not 
 inhibited); we thank Sol Swords for requesting that change.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a></span> field of a rule of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, 
 should still be a list of lists <span class="v">(var1 var2 fn1 fn2 ... fnk)</span>, where 
 <span class="v">var1</span> and <span class="v">var2</span> are variables and the <span class="v">fni</span> are symbols.  But 
 formerly each <span class="v">fni</span> was required to be a function symbol; now, it can be a 
 macro alias for a function symbol (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a></span>).  For example, 
 the following is a valid <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a></span> field: <span class="v">((x y +))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The restrictions on utilities <span class="v">oracle-apply</span> and <span class="v">oracle-funcall</span> 
 have been updated in order to avoid potentially confusing or inappropriate 
 results, by imposing the following new requirements on their first argument, 
 which must still be a function symbol.  That symbol must not be 
 <span class="v">if</span> (formerly the illegal symbol was <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span>); it must not be 
 a key of the alist, <span class="v">*ttag-fns-and-macros*</span>; it must not be 
 untouchable (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-UNTOUCHABLE.html">remove-untouchable</a></span>); and it must not be a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span> creator (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span>).</p> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> guard on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DIVE-INTO-MACROS-TABLE.html">dive-into-macros-table</a></span> has been 
 strengthened in order to avoid calling untouchable functions (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-UNTOUCHABLE.html">remove-untouchable</a></span>).</p> 
 
 <h3>New Features</h3> 
 
 <p>We have added a tool for writing out useful information about a book's 
 event names when certifying the book.  See <a href="ACL2____BOOKDATA.html">bookdata</a>.  Thanks to Dave 
 Greve for requesting this tool and participating in its specification.</p> 
 
 <p>There are new analogues of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">add-include-book-dir</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR.html">delete-include-book-dir</a></span>: <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">add-include-book-dir!</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DELETE-INCLUDE-BOOK-DIR_12.html">delete-include-book-dir!</a></span>, respectively.  The new utilities are similar to 
 their existing counterparts, except that their effects are not <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> to 
 enclosing <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> events.  Thanks to Shilpi Goel 
 for requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>The class of <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> rules has been broadened considerably, so 
 that one can restrict to patterns.  For example, a congruence rule can now 
 state that an equivalence is maintained for the term <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 1 (f (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> u
 v) y 'a))</span> when rewriting <span class="v">y</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____PATTERNED-CONGRUENCE.html">patterned-congruence</a>.  Thanks 
 to Sol Swords for requesting this feature.</p> 
 
 <h3>Heuristic Improvements</h3> 
 
 <p>(None to report this time.)</p> 
 
 <h3>Bug Fixes</h3> 
 
 <p>Fixed a soundness bug in the handling of hypotheses of conditional 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> rules invoked during rewriting by applying 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXPAND.html">expand</a></span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  See (defxdoc note-6-4 ...) in community 
 book <span class="v">system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span> for a proof of <span class="v">nil</span> in ACL2 Version_6.3 
 that exploits this bug.</p> 
 
 <p>It had been possible to update a <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> (either an ordinary stobj or 
 an abstract stobjs) so that it no longer satisfies its recognizer predicate. 
 This soundness bug has been fixed.  Thanks to Jared Davis and Sol Swords for 
 pointing out this bug, making useful observations about the issue, and sending 
 proofs of <span class="v">nil</span>, one of which may be found in a Lisp comment in the 
 defxdoc form for <span class="v">note-6-4</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a long-standing soundness bug (found at least as far back as Version 
 1.9!) in the checking done for <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> rules.  There had failed to 
 be a check that the new variable on the right-hand side of the conclusion is 
 indeed new.  The following example is shown in detail as a comment in function 
 <span class="v">interpret-term-as-congruence-rule</span>, ACL2 source file <span class="v">defthm.lisp</span>, 
 where it is used to prove <span class="v">nil</span> in Version  6.3.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (e y1 y2)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (h y2 y1)
                (h y2 y2)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in the ACL2 character reader that was causing an end-of-file 
 error when reading from a string ending in <span class="tt">"#\c"</span>, for <span class="v">c</span> a 
 character or non-terminating sequence of characters.  Thanks to Jared Davis 
 for sending the following example, whose evaluation in raw Lisp had caused an 
 error.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LET_A2.html">let*</a> ((*readtable* *acl2-readtable*)
       (stream (make-string-input-stream "#\\a"))
       (x1 (read stream nil :EOF))
       (x2 (read stream nil :EOF)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x1 x2))</pre> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) Improved the automatic proclaiming mechanism used for GCL 
 builds, in particular to avoid computing a return type when a term is detected 
 that could come from a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NON-EXEC.html">non-exec</a></span>, and to do a more complete job 
 for calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RETURN-LAST.html">return-last</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>(CCL only) A CCL bug was treating filenames of the form <span class="v">"~/user/..."</span> 
 as <span class="v">"~/..."</span>.  Thanks to Gary Byers for sending us a CCL-specific form 
 that is now included in the ACL2 sources, which avoids this problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Attempts to submit <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a></span> rules had unfortunate consequences in 
 the case that the function ``symbol'' is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a></span>: for 
 <span class="v">if</span>, rules were appropriately ignored because of the special handling that 
 ACL2 already gives to calls of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> for congruence-based reasoning, 
 while for <span class="v">quote</span>, it was possible to get a hard Lisp error.  Now, attempts 
 to submit such rules will result in a clear ACL2 error.</p> 
 
 <p>It had been possible to get a confusing raw Lisp error when submitting a 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> event whose first argument is not a symbol, as in: 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a> (fld :type integer :initially 0))</span>.  That user error is now 
 reported gracefully by ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p>When an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form is executed for a non-existent book, we 
 no longer get a bogus warning about a missing compiled file.  (Of course the 
 compiled file is missing when the book itself is missing!  So there's no need 
 to report this fact.)  Thanks to Caleb Eggensperger for bringing this issue to 
 our attention.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes at the System Level</h3> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 system <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been reworked for the <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> 
 framework developed by Jared Davis.  While the ACL2 User's Manual can still be 
 built, it is now possible for the ACL2 community to contribute to the ACL2 
 system documentation, in community book 
 <span class="tt">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>; see comments near the top of that 
 book.  Now that both the ACL2 system documentation and much of the community 
 books documentation are written in <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a> format, we hope the ACL2 
 community will add links from the ACL2 system documentation topics to book 
 documentation topics.  Note that <span class="v">:</span><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a> still works at the terminal, 
 but it is based on the new system, and other terminal-based access to the 
 documentation has been eliminated (for example <span class="v">:more</span>).  Thanks to Jared 
 for all his work contributing to this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed community books <span class="v">books/Makefile-generic</span> and also 
 <span class="v">books/Makefile</span>, which now has filename <span class="v">books/GNUmakefile</span>, to work 
 with Cygwin (Windows).  Thanks to Harsh Raju Chamarthi for his substantial 
 help.</p> 
 
 <p>The guard for system function <span class="v">ev-fncall-w</span> now includes an arity 
 check.</p> 
 
 <h3>EMACS Support</h3> 
 
 <p>There is now an Emacs utility for browsing the hypertext documentation for 
 ACL2 and the community books.  This browser, ACL2-Doc, essentially serves as a 
 replacement for Emacs Info, which can no longer be used to browse the 
 documentation.  ACL2-Doc can be used not just for the ACL2 User's Manual but 
 also for the ACL2+Books Manual.  It is loaded automatically into Emacs if you 
 load the file <span class="tt">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span>.  See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Experimental/Alternate Versions</h3> 
 
 <p>(None to report this time.)</p>
