<p>How the theorem prover works — level 0</p><p>Software is complex, and ACL2 is a piece of software that is used 
 to analyze software — adding another layer of complexity.  Furthermore, 
 instead of being limited to static analysis for certain fixed properties, ACL2 
 allows you — indeed, forces you — to formalize the problem and the 
 questions.  It ``knows'' nothing inherent about your problem before you start 
 to interact with it.  But it can be used to help answer the most complicated 
 questions you can ask about software.</p> 
 
 <p>All this is to say that it is not the kind of tool that you just install 
 and then start to use effectively.  So OK, you've installed it or confirmed 
 that you can invoke it.  Good for you.  Now you have to learn how to use it! 
 Your success ultimately comes down to your understanding of your problem 
 domain and your appropriate exploitation of ACL2's strengths and avoidance of 
 its weaknesses.  So put aside the idea of sitting down and interacting with 
 it.  Instead, learn about it.</p> 
 
 <p>We assume you know some of the <a href="ACL2____INTERESTING-APPLICATIONS.html">industrial applications</a> of ACL2.  Realizing 
 that such things can be done may sustain you during the long learning curve! 
 We also assume you have taken both the <a href="ACL2____A_02Flying_02Tour_02of_02ACL2.html">Flying Tour</a> and the <a href="ACL2____A_02Walking_02Tour_02of_02ACL2.html">Walking Tour</a>.  The tours give you a good 
 overview of the whole system where this tutorial focuses on how to use the 
 prover itself.</p>

 <p>This tutorial will take you several hours — maybe several days 
 — to work through.  Do not breeze through it as you might a blog. 
 <i>Think</i> your way through it.  <i>Remember</i> what you read.  Do not take 
 short cuts.  If you start to use ACL2 before you really know how, it will only 
 frustrate you.</p>

 <p>Most users of ACL2 have bought the book</p> 
 
 <p><i>Computer-Aided Reasoning: An Approach</i>, Kaufmann, Manolios, and

 companion (also available on Lulu) describing applications of ACL2, some of 
 which are from industry.</p> 
 
 <p>Using ACL2 is akin to having a partner in the theorem proving enterprise. 
 It will do some of the work and you will do some of the work.  It can't really 
 be any other way because theorem proving is undecidable.  You bring a quirky, 
 error-prone, creative insight to the problem, and ACL2 brings accuracy, logic, 
 and perseverance.</p> 
 
 <p>Here we describe a ``model'' of how the system works and introduce some of 
 the ideas and terminology you'll use repeatedly when interacting with it.</p> 
 
 <p>This article is about the <i>theorem prover</i> itself, not the programming 
 language and not the logic.  We assume you know enough about the ACL2 
 programming language that you can define simple functions, run them, and read 
 and write ACL2 constants and terms.  For some examples of what we'll take for 
 granted about ACL2 programming, see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED.html">programming-knowledge-taken-for-granted</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>We also assume you know enough about logic to understand, for example, the 
 words we use to talk about formulas and proofs.  To see some examples of what 
 we'll take for granted about your knowledge of logic terminology, see <a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED.html">logic-knowledge-taken-for-granted</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>When you give the theorem prover a goal formula to prove, it tries to prove 
 it by breaking it down into subgoals, each of which must be proved in order to 
 prove the original goal.  This breaking apart of the goal is done by various 
 <i>proof techniques</i> built into ACL2.  Different proof techniques break the 
 formula apart in different ways.  For example, the <i>simplifier</i> rips 
 apart the propositional structure to isolate the various cases and applies 
 rewrite rules to simplify the subterms of the formula, while the 
 <i>induction</i> <i>engine</i> will attempt to break the goal into some base 
 cases and some induction steps.</p> 
 
 <p>The theorem prover's behavior is affected by a <i>database</i> of 
 <i>rules</i> derived from axioms, definitions, and previously proved theorems. 
 The database also records the <i>enabled status</i> of each rule; only enabled 
 rules are seen by the prover and you can set the status of a rule.  There are 
 many other user-settable switches and parameters affecting the behavior of the 
 prover; you'll learn about some of them later.</p> 
 
 <p>You guide the theorem prover most of the time simply by identifying lemmas 
 for it to prove.  (A <i>lemma</i> is just a theorem that you think is useful 
 in the proofs of other theorems.)</p> 
 
 <p>Why does this guide the theorem prover?  Because every time you get the 
 system to prove a theorem, it turns the theorem into a rule (unless you tell 
 it not to) and stores the rule in the database.  That changes how the prover 
 behaves subsequently.  But <i>you</i> determine the kind of rule ACL2 
 stores.</p> 
 
 <p>To learn to ``drive'' the theorem prover you have to learn how various 
 rules affect the system's behavior and how it turns proved formulas into 
 rules.  But before we discuss this, we discuss a more mathematical activity: 
 how do you figure out the lemmas ACL2 will need in order for it to prove 
 interesting theorems?  ACL2 can often help you in this activity, if you use it 
 in the right way.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is the way we recommend you use ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p><b>The Method</b>.</p> 
 
 <p>(1) you present ACL2 with the goal conjecture to prove</p> 
 
 <p>(2) typically, it fails to prove it (or you abort its attempt), but it 
 prints some <i>Key Checkpoints</i></p> 
 
 <p>(3) you look at the Key Checkpoints and decide that you know a fact that 
 will help; this tutorial will present some helpful questions to keep in 
 mind</p> 
 
 <p>(4) you formalize your knowledge as a formula, along with directions for 
 how ACL2 should turn the formula into a rule; this tutorial will tell you 
 about the most commonly used rule, the <i>rewrite</i> rule</p> 
 
 <p>(5) you recursively apply The Method to get ACL2 to prove your formula and 
 to store it as the kind of rule you specified</p> 
 
 <p>(6) go to step (1)</p> 
 
 <p>Caveat: This approach simply won't work on some theorems!  Basically, this 
 is a ``troubleshooting'' approach, where you're letting ACL2 determine the 
 basic strategy and you're just helping with the subgoals.  But for some 
 theorems, ACL2's approach will be misguided and no amount of troubleshooting 
 will salvage its strategy.  You'll have a sense that this is happening when it 
 happens because the formulas ACL2 presents to you will raise issues that feel 
 irrelevant to you.  The basic truth is that if you think a formula is always 
 true there are usually strong intuitive reasons behind your belief.  If you 
 were asked to defend your belief, you'd start to explain your reasons and with 
 training you can turn that into a proof.  So when ACL2's formulas present you 
 with things you haven't thought of either (a) you'll have an ``Ah ha!'' 
 moment when you realize you hadn't considered that case or (b) you'll realize 
 that ACL2's approach is different from your intuitive ``proof.''</p> 
 
 <p>But, surprisingly often, the troubleshooting approach to finding proofs 
 works quite well, especially as you rein in your expectations and develop a 
 sense of what ACL2 can handle on its own.  Of course, if you can decompose the 
 proof into a couple of main lemmas before you start, so much the better: write 
 down your sequence of lemmas, thinking about the rules you want them to 
 generate, and get ACL2 to prove each of them before giving it the main 
 theorem.  This <i>proof planning</i> approach will gradually become an 
 integral part of your use of The Method.</p> 
 
 <p>The only mechanized help we can offer with The Method, aside from the 
 theorem prover itself, are tools to help you manage the stack of subgoals it 
 generates when, in step (5) you recursively apply The Method to a lemma. 
 There are both Emacs and Eclipse tools available.</p> 
 
 <p>To use The Method you have to read the Key Checkpoints printed at the very 
 end of <i>failed</i> proof attempts, just after the line that reads:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">The key checkpoint goals, below, may help you to debug this failure.</pre> 
 
 <p>Most users do not read the output from successful proofs and do not read 
 the output <i>during</i> a proof — they just let it stream by as a sort 
 of gestalt meter on the theorem prover's progress or lack thereof.  For 
 example, you'll be able to tell it is in a loop and needs to be 
 interrupted.</p> 
 
 <p>You will respond to most Key Checkpoints by formulating new lemmas for the 
 system to prove and store as rules designed by you to alter ACL2's behavior so 
 that it proves the Key Checkpoints.  You will give each lemma a <i>name</i> 
 and write some <i>formula</i> to express the mathematical idea.  You'll 
 command ACL2 to prove it by typing:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defthm <i>name</i> 
        <i>formula</i> 
        ...) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>In the ``...'' you may provide two other kinds of information: <i>hints</i> 
 for how to prove <i>formula</i> and directives, called <i>rule-classes</i>, 
 for how to convert <i>formula</i> into a rule after it has proved 
 <i>formula</i>.  Note that <i>you</i> are in charge of determining what kind 
 of rule ACL2 generates!  There are over a dozen different types of rules with 
 many opportunities to specialize each type.  But the most common kind of rule 
 you'll want to generate is a <i>rewrite</i> rule.</p>
