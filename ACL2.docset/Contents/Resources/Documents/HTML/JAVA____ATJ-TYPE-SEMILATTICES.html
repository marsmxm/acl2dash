<p>The two semilattices consisting of ATJ types and <span class="v">nil</span>.</p><p>Above we have introduced and verified two separate semilattices. 
     Both semilattices consist of the values in <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-MAYBE-TYPEP.html">atj-maybe-typep</a></span>, 
     but in the join semilattice <span class="v">nil</span> is the top, 
     while in the meet semilattice <span class="v">nil</span> is the bottom.</p><p>These two semilattices are not the semilattice halves of a lattice: 
     <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-MAYBE-TYPEP.html">atj-maybe-typep</a></span> does not form a lattice, 
     because <span class="v">nil</span> cannot be simultaneously top and bottom, 
     and in fact the two partial orders, 
     <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPE-TOP-_C3_D3.html">atj-type-top-&lt;=</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____ATJ-TYPE-BOTTOM-_C3_D3.html">atj-type-bottom-&lt;=</a></span>, 
     differ even though they are defined on the same set.</p>
