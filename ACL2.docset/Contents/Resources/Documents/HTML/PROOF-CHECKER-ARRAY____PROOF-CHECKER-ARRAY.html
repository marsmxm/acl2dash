<h2>Abstract From Dissertation</h2> 
 
<p>Satisfiability (SAT) solvers are commonly used for a variety of 
applications, including hardware verification, software verification, theorem 
proving, debugging, and hard combinatorial problems.  These applications rely 
on the efficiency and correctness of SAT solvers.  When a problem is determined 
to be unsatisfiable, how can one be confident that a SAT solver has fully 
exhausted the search space?  Traditionally, unsatisfiability results have been 
expressed using resolution or clausal proof systems.  Resolution-based proofs 
contain perfect reconstruction information, but these proofs are extremely 
large and difficult to emit from a solver.  Clausal proofs rely on rediscovery 
of inferences using a limited number of techniques, which typically takes 
several orders of magnitude longer than the solving time.  Moreover, neither of 
these proof systems has been able to express contemporary solving techniques 
such as bounded variable addition.  This combination of issues has left SAT 
solver authors unmotivated to produce proofs of unsatisfiability.</p> 
 
<p>The work from this dissertation focuses on validating satisfiability solver 
output in the unsatisfiability case.  We developed a new clausal proof format 
called DRAT that facilitates compact proofs that are easier to emit and capable 
of expressing all contemporary solving and preprocessing techniques. 
Furthermore, we implemented a validation utility called DRAT-trim that is able 
to validate proofs in a time similar to that of the discovery time.  The DRAT 
format has seen widespread adoption in the SAT community and the DRAT-trim 
utility was used to validate the results of the 2014 SAT Competition.</p> 
 
<p>DRAT-trim uses many advanced techniques to realize its performance gains, so 
why should the results of DRAT-trim be trusted?  Mechanical verification 
enables users to model programs and algorithms and then prove their correctness 
with a proof assistant, such as ACL2.  We designed a new modeling technique for 
ACL2 that combines efficient model execution with an agile and convenient 
theory.  Finally, we used this new technique to construct a fast, 
mechanically-verified validation tool for proofs of unsatisfiability.  This 
research allows SAT solver authors and users to have greater confidence in 
their results and applications by ensuring the validity of unsatisfiability 
results.</p>
