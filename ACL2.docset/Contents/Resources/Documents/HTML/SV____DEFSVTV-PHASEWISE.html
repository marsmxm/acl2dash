<p>Alternative format for creating an SVTV.</p><p>A longstanding frustration with the SVTV user interface is that you 
need to insert the right number of underscores on each line before a cycle in 
which something happens.  When the sequencing changes, you need to then insert 
or delete the right number of underscores on multiple lines.</p> 
 
<p>This alternative interface for defsvtv works around this problem by 
generating an old-style SVTV from a new input format that is easier to get 
right and easier to maintain.</p> 
 
<p>The input format looks like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="SV____DEFSVTV-PHASEWISE.html">defsvtv-phasewise</a> my-svtv
  :design *my-design*
  :parents ... :short ... :long ...
  :simplify t   ;; default
  :phases
  (;; Phase 0:
   (:label p
    :inputs (("clk" 0 :toggle 1)  ;; will toggle each phase until end or until reassigned
             ("start" 1)))

   ;; Phase 4:
   (:delay 4 ;; number of phases since last one listed
    :label q
    :inputs (("cntl" cntl4 :hold t)) ;; will hold this value until end or until reassigned
    :overrides (("inst.subinst.internalsig" internal4)))

   ;; Phase 6:
   (:delay 2
    :label r
    :inputs (("late" late6))
    :outputs (("early" early6)))

   ;; Phase 8:
   (:delay 2
    :label s
    :inputs (("cntl" _)) ;; release previous held value
    :outputs (("inst.subinst.interesting" interesting8)))))</pre> 
 
<p>The keyword options are the same as for <a href="ACL2____DEFSVTV.html">defsvtv</a>, except that 
<span class="v">:phases</span> replaces <span class="v">:inputs</span>, <span class="v">:overrides</span>, <span class="v">:outputs</span>, 
<span class="v">:internals</span>, and <span class="v">:labels</span>.</p> 
 
<p>For now, defsvtv-phasewise is implemented by simply preprocessing it into a <a href="ACL2____DEFSVTV.html">defsvtv</a> form.  Perhaps later both forms will instead be different interfaces 
to a shared backend.</p> 
 
<p>The format of the <span class="v">:phases</span> input is a list of individual phases, which are 
keyword-value lists with the following keywords recognized:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:delay</span>: Number of phases since the previous one in the list, 
defaulting to 1.  Must be positive.  (Note: If the first phase in the list has 
a delay of 1, its assignments occur on the first phase that is to be simulated. 
Phase 0 is skipped, in some sense.)</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:label</span>: Optional name of the phase, for documentation purposes.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:inputs</span>: Input signals to be assigned a value at that phase.  Entries are described below.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:overrides</span>: Internal signals to be overridden to some value at that phase.  Entries are described below.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:outputs</span>: Signals to be read and their values stored in variables at that phase.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>The format for <span class="v">:outputs</span> is simply a list of entries of the form</p> 
<pre class="code">(signal-name variable-name)</pre> 
<p>where signal-name is a string giving the real hierarchical name in the 
design and variable-name is a symbol.</p> 
 
<p>The format for <span class="v">:inputs</span> is a list of entries of the form:</p> 
<pre class="code">(signal-name setting [ :hold t-or-nil | :toggle nphases ])</pre> 
<p>Setting can be one of:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>a 4vec constant, that is, an integer or a pair <span class="v">(upper . lower)</span>, both integers</li> 
<li>a don't-care indicator, which is a symbol whose name is "_", "-", or "&amp;" in any package</li> 
<li>a variable, i.e. any other non-Boolean, non-keyword symbol.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">:hold</span> keyword, if set to t, indicates that this assignment is 
valid for all subsequent phases until the same signal is set again.</p> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">:toggle</span> keyword, if set to t or a positive integer <span class="v">nphases</span>, 
indicates that the signal will be held and toggled every <span class="v">nphases</span> phases, 
where <span class="v">t</span> is the same as 1.  It is only valid (for now) if the setting is a 
constant.</p> 
 
<p>Note: Don't use the special symbol <span class="v">~</span>, which is what you'd use for 
<span class="v">:toggle</span> in the original <span class="v">defsvtv</span>.</p> 
 
<p>The format for <span class="v">:overrides</span> is similar to that of inputs, except that 
its setting field can take one additional form:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> test)</pre> 
 
<p>In this form both value and test may be either a 4vec constant or a 
variable (not a don't-care).  This indicates that the override occurs 
conditioned on the test being 1, and when test is 1, the signal is overridden 
to value. The <span class="v">:toggle</span> and <span class="v">:hold</span> keywords still apply: <span class="v">:hold</span> 
means that test and value both apply to subsequent phases, and <span class="v">:toggle</span> 
means that test applies to subsequent phases and value is toggled.</p>
