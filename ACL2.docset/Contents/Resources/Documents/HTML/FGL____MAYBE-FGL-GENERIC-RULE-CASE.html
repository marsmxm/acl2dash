<p>Case macro for the different kinds of <a href="FGL____MAYBE-FGL-GENERIC-RULE.html">maybe-fgl-generic-rule</a> structures.</p><p>This is an <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">ACL2::fty</a> sum-type case macro, 
typically introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">defflexsum</a> or <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">fty::deftagsum</a>.  It 
allows you to safely check the type of a <a href="FGL____MAYBE-FGL-GENERIC-RULE.html">maybe-fgl-generic-rule</a> structure, or to split 
into cases based on its type.</p> 
 
<h3>Short Form</h3> 
 
<p>In its short form, <span class="v">maybe-fgl-generic-rule-case</span> allows you to safely check the type of 
a <span class="v">maybe-fgl-generic-rule</span> structure.  For example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FGL____MAYBE-FGL-GENERIC-RULE-CASE.html">maybe-fgl-generic-rule-case</a> x :none)</pre> 
<p>can be used to determine whether <span class="v">x</span> is a <span class="v">none</span> instead of some other kind of maybe-fgl-generic-rule structure.</p><h3>Long Form</h3> 
 
<p>In its longer form, <span class="v">maybe-fgl-generic-rule-case</span> allows you to split into cases based 
on the kind of structure you are looking at.  A typical example would be:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="FGL____MAYBE-FGL-GENERIC-RULE-CASE.html">maybe-fgl-generic-rule-case</a> x
  :none ...
  :some ...)</pre> 
 
<p>It is also possible to consolidate ``uninteresting'' cases using 
<span class="v">:otherwise</span>.</p> 
 
<p>For convenience, the case macro automatically binds the fields of <span class="v">x</span> for 
you, as appropriate for each case.  That is, in the <span class="v">:none</span> case, 
you can use <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>-style <span class="v">foo.bar</span> style accessors for <span class="v">x</span> 
without having to explicitly add a <span class="v">none</span> <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> 
binder.</p>
