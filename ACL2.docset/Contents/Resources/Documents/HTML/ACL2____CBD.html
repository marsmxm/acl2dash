<p>Connected book directory string</p><pre class="code">Example:
ACL2 !&gt;:cbd
"/usr/home/smith/"</pre> 
 
 <p>The connected book directory is a nonempty string that specifies a 
 directory as an absolute pathname.  (See <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a> for a discussion of 
 file naming conventions.)  When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> is given a relative book 
 name it elaborates it into a full book name, essentially by appending the 
 connected book directory string to the left and <span class="v">".lisp"</span> to the right. 
 (For details, see <a href="ACL2____BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a> and also see <a href="ACL2____FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a>.) 
 Similarly, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> elaborates relative pathnames into full pathnames using 
 the connected book directory string.  (The effect of the <span class="v">cbd</span> on <span class="v">ld</span> 
 carries over to utilities that invoke <span class="v">ld</span> as well, notably, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REBUILD.html">rebuild</a></span>.)  Furthermore, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> temporarily set 
 the connected book directory to the directory string of the resulting full 
 pathname so that references to files in the same directory may omit the 
 directory.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a> for how to set the connected book directory 
 string.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____CBD.html">cbd</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>This is a macro that expands into a term involving the single free variable 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.  It returns the connected book directory string.</p> 
 
 <p>The connected book directory (henceforth called the ``<span class="v">cbd</span>'') is used 
 by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> to elaborate the supplied book name into a full book 
 name (see <a href="ACL2____FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a>); similarly for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>.  For example, if 
 the <span class="v">cbd</span> is <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/"</span> then the elaboration of the <a href="ACL2____BOOK-NAME.html">book-name</a> <span class="v">"project/task-1/arith"</span> (to the <span class="v">".lisp"</span> extension) is 
 <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/arith.lisp"</span>.  That <a href="ACL2____FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a> is what <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> opens to read the source text for 
 the book.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">cbd</span> may be changed using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a></span> (see <a href="ACL2____SET-CBD.html">set-cbd</a>). 
 Furthermore, during the processing of the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in a book, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> sets the <span class="v">cbd</span> to be the directory string of the <a href="ACL2____FULL-BOOK-NAME.html">full-book-name</a> of the book; similarly for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>.  Thus, if the <span class="v">cbd</span> 
 is <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/"</span> then during the processing of <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> 
 by</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "project/task-1/arith")</pre> 
 
 <p>the <span class="v">cbd</span> will be set to <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/project/task-1/"</span>.  Note 
 that if <span class="v">"arith"</span> recursively includes a sub-book, say <span class="v">"naturals"</span>, 
 that resides on the same directory, the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event for it may 
 omit the specification of that directory.  For example, <span class="v">"arith"</span> might 
 contain the event</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "naturals").</pre> 
 
 <p>In general, suppose we have a superior book and several inferior <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> which are included by <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in the superior book.  Any inferior 
 book residing on the same directory as the superior book may be referenced in 
 the superior without specification of the directory.</p> 
 
 <p>We call this a ``relative'' as opposed to ``absolute'' naming.  The use of 
 relative naming is preferred because it permits <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> (and their 
 accompanying inferiors) to be moved between directories while maintaining 
 their <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>s and utility.  Certified <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> that reference 
 inferiors by absolute file names are unusable (and rendered uncertified) if 
 the inferiors are moved to new directories.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Technical Note and a Challenge to Users:</i></p> 
 
 <p>After elaborating the book name to a full book name, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 opens a channel to the file to process the <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> in it.  In some host 
 Common Lisps, the actual file opened depends upon a notion of ``connected 
 directory'' similar to our connected book directory.  Our intention in always 
 elaborating book names into absolute filename strings (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____PATHNAME.html">pathname</a> for 
 terminology) is to circumvent the sensitivity to the connected directory.  But 
 we may have insufficient control over this since the ultimate file naming 
 conventions are determined by the host operating system rather than Common 
 Lisp (though, we do check that the operating system ``appears'' to be one that 
 we ``know'' about).  Here is a question, which we'll pose assuming that we 
 have an operating system that calls itself ``Unix.''  Suppose we have a file 
 name, filename, that begins with a slash, e.g., <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/..."</span>. 
 Consider two successive invocations of CLTL's</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(open filename :direction :input)</pre> 
 
 <p>separated only by a change to the operating system's notion of connected 
 directory.  Must these two invocations produce streams to the same file?  A 
 candidate string might be something like 
 <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/*/usr/local/src/foo.lisp"</span> which includes some 
 operating system-specific special character to mean ``here insert the 
 connected directory'' or, more generally, ``here make the name dependent on 
 some non-ACL2 aspect of the host's state.''  If such ``tricky'' name strings 
 beginning with a slash exist, then we have failed to isolate ACL2 adequately 
 from the operating system's file naming conventions.  Once upon a time, ACL2 
 did not insist that the <span class="v">cbd</span> begin with a slash and that allowed the 
 string <span class="v">"foo.lisp"</span> to be tricky because if one were connected to 
 <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/"</span> then with the empty <span class="v">cbd</span> <span class="v">"foo.lisp"</span> is a 
 full book name that names the same file as <span class="v">"/usr/home/smith/foo.lisp"</span>. 
 If the actual file one reads is determined by the operating system's state 
 then it is possible for ACL2 to have two distinct ``full book names'' for the 
 same file, the ``real'' name and the ``tricky'' name.  This can cause ACL2 to 
 include the same book twice, not recognizing the second one as 
 redundant.</p>
