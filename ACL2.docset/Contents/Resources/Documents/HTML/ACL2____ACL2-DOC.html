<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____ACL2-DOC">Click for ACL2-doc in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A custom Emacs browser for reading ACL2 <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a></p><p>As discussed elsewhere (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>), the web-based 
 <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-4/combined-manual/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2+Books Manual<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-4/combined-manual/index.html"></nobr></a> provides a way to browse the combined 
 documentation for the ACL2 system and community books.  Such documentation can 
 also be read at the terminal using the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> command, though 
 documentation for <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> will only be included for those books that have 
 been included in the session.  In this topic we describe how to browse the 
 documentation using ACL2-Doc, a browser for reading 
 documentation inside Emacs.  It supports reading the combined documentation 
 (ACL2 plus books), but it also supports reading the ACL2-only manual as well 
 as custom manuals.  We assume some familiarity with Emacs, for example, the 
 notion of a ``prefix argument'': a numeric value given first with the 
 <span class="v">meta</span> key (or, probably the <span class="v">control</span> key), for example, <span class="v">meta-0
 control-t g</span> or <span class="v">control-3 control-t /</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>While ACL2-Doc is much like Emacs Info, it is a separate system that 
 provides some additional functionality.  ACL2-Doc is text-based.  Any word 
 that names a topic is a link: you can hit the <span class="v">&lt;Return&gt;</span> key while standing 
 on that topic to go to the page of documentation for that topic.  However, 
 many links are shown explicitly, inside square brackets.  For example, here is 
 a link that will take you to the BOOKS topic; it should show up surrounded by 
 square brackets if you are now reading at the terminal or in ACL2-Doc, but 
 there are no square brackets for this link if you are reading on the web.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a></p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>It should be very rare for square brackets to be intended simply as square 
 brackets, not as link indicators.</p> 
 
 <p>In order to use ACL2-Doc, load the distributed file 
 <span class="tt">emacs/acl2-doc.el</span> into Emacs.  This will happen automatically if you 
 load <span class="tt">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span>, which will happen automatically if you put 
 the following form in your <span class="tt">~/.emacs</span> file, replacing <span class="v">DIR</span> by a 
 path to your ACL2 installation.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(load "DIR/emacs/emacs-acl2.el")</pre> 
 
 <p>Then to start the browser at the top-level topic, either execute the Emacs 
 command</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">meta-x acl2-doc</pre> 
 
 <p>or else type:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Control-t g</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, you can put the following form in your <span class="v">.emacs</span> file if you want 
 <span class="v">acl2-doc</span> to run automatically when Emacs starts up.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">acl2-doc</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>By default you will browse the ACL2+Books Manual, though if you are using a 
 git version between ACL2 releases then you may be queried; more on that below. 
 Or, see below for how to set a variable in your <span class="v">.emacs</span> file, 
 <span class="v">*acl2-doc-manual-name*</span>, so that you will browse a custom manual.  You can 
 enter the ACL2-Doc browser at a specific documentation topic as follows (in 
 analogy to Emacs command <span class="v">Meta-.</span>):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Control-t .</pre> 
 
 <p>In each of the cases above, you will now be in a buffer called 
 "<span class="tt">acl2-doc</span>", which will be displaying the top-level ACL2 topic in a 
 special mode, the ACL2-Doc major mode.  That mode provides the following key 
 bindings; you can also see these by typing <span class="tt">Control-h m</span> while in that 
 buffer.</p>

 <span class="tt">Control-h k {key}</span> or <span class="tt">Control-h f {command}</span>.  Here is what 
 you will find in each case if you do that.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">&lt;Return&gt;      acl2-doc-go!
   Go to the topic occurring at the cursor position.  In the case
   of &lt;NAME&gt;, instead go to the source code definition of NAME for
   the current manual (as for `/', but without a minibuffer query).

Shift-&lt;Return&gt;  acl2-doc-go!-new-buffer
   Go to the topic occurring at the cursor position in a new buffer.  In the
   case of &lt;NAME&gt;, instead go to the source code definition of NAME for the
   current manual (as for `/', but without a minibuffer query).

g             acl2-doc-go
   Go to the specified topic; performs completion.

h             acl2-doc-help
   Go to the ACL2-DOC topic to read about how to use the ACL2-Doc browser.

?             acl2-doc-summary
   Go to the ACL2-Doc-summary topic for one-line summaries of ACL2-Doc
   browser commands.

i             acl2-doc-index
   Go to the specified topic or else one containing it as a substring;
   performs completion.  If the empty string is supplied, then go to the
   index buffer.  Otherwise, with prefix argument, consider only descendents
   of the topic supplied in response to a prompt.  Note that the index buffer
   is in ACL2-Doc mode; thus, in particular, you can type &lt;RETURN&gt; while
   standing on a topic in order to go directly to that topic.

,             acl2-doc-index-next
   Find the next topic containing, as a substring, the topic of the most
   recent i command.  Note: if this is the first "," or "&lt;" after an
   exact match from "i", then start the topic search alphabetically from
   the beginning, but avoid a second hit on the original topic.  Also note
   that this command is buffer-local; it will follow the most recent i
   command executed in the current ACL2-Doc buffer.

&lt;             acl2-doc-index-previous
   Find the previous topic containing, as a substring, the topic of the most
   recent i command.  Note: if this is the first "," or "&lt;" after an
   exact match from "i", then start the topic search alphabetically
   (backwards) from that exact match.  Also note that this command is
   buffer-local like the "," command.

l             acl2-doc-last
   Go to the last topic visited in the current buffer.  This command is
   buffer-local.

n             acl2-doc-search-next
   Find the next occurrence for the most recent search or regular expression
   search.  Note that this command is buffer-local; it will follow the most
   recent search initiated in the current buffer.

p             acl2-doc-search-previous
   Find the previous occurrence for the most recent search or regular
   expression search.  Note: as for "n", the cursor will end up at the end
   of the match, and this command is buffer-local.

q             acl2-doc-quit
   Quit the current ACL2-Doc buffer.

K             acl2-doc-kill-buffers
   Kill all background ACL2-Doc buffers.  If invoked in an ACl2-Doc buffer,
   all ACl2-Doc buffers except the current one will be killed.  If invoked in
   any other buffer, all ACL2-Doc buffers will be killed.  With prefix
   argument, avoid a query that asks for confirmation.

r             acl2-doc-return
   Return to the last topic visited in the current buffer, popping the stack
   of such topics.  This command is buffer-local.

s             acl2-doc-search
   Search forward from the top of the manual for the input string.  If the
   search succeeds, then go to that topic with the cursor put immediately
   after the found text, with the topic name displayed in the minibuffer.
   With prefix argument, consider (also for subsequent "n" and "p"
   commands) only descendents of the topic supplied in response to a prompt.

S             acl2-doc-re-search
   Perform a regular expression search, forward from the top of the manual,
   for the input string.  If the search succeeds, then go to that topic with
   the cursor put immediately after the found text, with the topic name
   displayed in the minibuffer.  With prefix argument, consider (also for
   subsequent "n" and "p" commands) only descendents of the topic
   supplied in response to a prompt.

t             acl2-doc-top
   Go to the top topic.

u             acl2-doc-up
   Go to the parent of the current topic.

w             acl2-doc-where
   Display the topic name in the minibuffer, together with the manual name
   (ACL2+Books Manual or ACL2 User's Manual)

SPC           scroll-up
   Scroll up (same as Control-v)

TAB           acl2-doc-tab
   Visit the next link after the cursor on the current page, searching from
   the top if no link is below the cursor.

&lt;backtab&gt; (which often is Shift-TAB):
              acl2-doc-tab-back
   Visit the previous link before the cursor on the current page, searching
   from the bottom if no link is below the cursor.

D
   Download the ``bleeding edge'' ACL2+Books Manual from the web; then
   restart the ACL2-Doc browser to view that manual.

H             acl2-doc-history
   Visit a buffer that displays the names of all topics visited (in any
   ACL2-Doc buffer) in order, newest at the bottom.  That buffer is in
   acl2-doc mode; thus the usual acl2-doc commands may be used.  In
   particular, you can visit a displayed topic name by putting your cursor on
   it and typing &lt;RETURN&gt;.

I             acl2-doc-initialize
   Restart the ACL2-Doc browser, clearing its state.  With a prefix argument,
   a query asks you to select the name of an available manual, using
   completion.  See the section on "Selecting a Manual", below,
   for more information.

/             acl2-doc-definition
(also control-t /)
   Find an ACL2 definition (in analogy to built-in Emacs command meta-.).
   With numeric prefix argument, find the next matching definition;
   otherwise, the user is prompted, where the default is the name at
   the cursor, obtained after stripping off any enclosing square
   brackets (<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>('[..]')), angle brackets (<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>('&lt;..&gt;')) as from srclink tags, and
   package prefixes.  With @('control-u') prefix argument, search only
   ACL2 source definitions; otherwise, books are searched as well.
   As with built-in Emacs command @('meta-.') , exact matches are given
   priority.  For more information, see the Section on "Selecting a
   Manual" in the acl2-doc online XDOC-based documentation.

W             acl2-doc-where-definition
   Find an ACL2 definition.  This is the same as
   acl2-doc-definition (<a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a> acl2-doc `/' command, as well as
   control-t /), except that the default comes from the name of the
   current page's topic instead of the cursor position.  Searches
   are continued identically when control-t / is given a numeric
   prefix argument, regardless of whether the first command was /,
   control-t /, or W; thus, a search started with W can be continued
   with, for example, meta-3 control-t /.</pre> 
 
 <h4>Selecting a Manual, Tags Files, and Custom Manuals</h4> 
 
 <p>ACL2-Doc can display the ACL2 User's Manual, which includes documentation 
 for the ACL2 system but not for the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>.  But by default, 
 ACL2-Doc will display the ACL2+Books Manual, which includes documentation for 
 those books as well.  To change which of these two manuals you display, just 
 give a prefix argument to the `<span class="v">I</span>' command, as described briefly 
 above.</p> 
 
 <p>For the `<span class="v">/</span>' and `<span class="v">W</span>' commands, you will need tags table files. 
 These come with the ACL2 gzipped tarfile distribution, but if you obtain ACL2 
 from github then you will need to build them.  The file <span class="v">"TAGS"</span> is used 
 when these commands are given a prefix argument (to search only the ACL2 
 sources), and is generated when building the <span class="v">saved_acl2</span> executable with 
 `<span class="v">make</span>'.  Without a prefix argument the file <span class="v">"TAGS-acl2-doc"</span> is 
 used for searching both the ACL2 sources and the books, and is created 
 automatically if you build the manual by certifying community book 
 <span class="v">books/doc/top.lisp</span>.  You can also build <span class="v">"TAGS-acl2-doc"</span> by running 
 the command <span class="v">bin/make-tags-acl2-doc.sh</span>, or by building the ACL2 executable 
 after setting variable <span class="v">TAGS_ACL2_DOC</span> to a non-empty value other than 
 <span class="v">SKIP</span> either on the command line with `<span class="v">make</span>' or, for example, by 
 putting one of the following forms in your <span class="v">~/.cshrc</span> or <span class="v">~/.bashrc</span>, 
 respectively.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">setenv TAGS_ACL2_DOC t

export TAGS_ACL2_DOC=t</pre> 
 
 <p>If you are using a git version of ACL2 and the books, between releases, 
 then you may need to download an extra file in order to browse the ACL2+Books 
 Manual.  Most likely you will just answer <span class="v">y</span> when queried about 
 downloading the file when first using ACL2-Doc.  If you want more details, see 
 the last of the notes in the ``Notes'' section below.</p> 
 
 <p>As mentioned above, you can give the `<span class="v">I</span>' command a prefix argument in 
 order to select a specific manual.  You will be asked for a name, which by 
 default will be the most recently selected such name, if any.  As noted above, 
 the only two manuals initially known to acl2-doc are the ACL2+Books Manual and 
 the ACL2 User's Manual.  These have the names `<span class="v">combined</span>' and 
 `<span class="v">acl2-only</span>', respectively.  You can also tell acl2-doc about a custom 
 manual, by evaluating (in Emacs) the following form, e.g., by adding it to 
 your <span class="v">~/.emacs</span> file before starting Emacs.  Here, <span class="v">filename</span> is the 
 pathname of a file typically created by calling <a href="XDOC____SAVE-RENDERED.html">xdoc::save-rendered</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(extend-acl2-doc-manual-alist
 'name          ; the name of the manual
 filename       ; documentation source, typically of the form *doc*.lsp
 'top           ; the top node name, typically TOP
 printname      ; optional print name (user-level name) of manual
 url            ; optional URL of gzipped file to download into filename
 tags-file-name ; optional tags filename (from output of etags)
 acl2-tags-file-name ; as above, but without files from books/ directory
 )</pre> 
 
 <p>For example, acl2-doc is initially built with the following two forms, 
 which is why you can respond to the query mentioned above with `<span class="v">combined</span>' 
 or `<span class="v">acl2-only</span>'.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(extend-acl2-doc-manual-alist
 'combined
 (concat *acl2-sources-dir*
         "books/system/doc/rendered-doc-combined.lsp")
 'TOP
 "ACL2+Books Manual"
 "http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/rendered-doc-combined.lsp.gz"
 (concat *acl2-sources-dir* "TAGS-acl2-doc")
 (concat *acl2-sources-dir* "TAGS"))

(extend-acl2-doc-manual-alist
 'acl2-only
 (concat *acl2-sources-dir* "doc.lisp")
 'ACL2
 "ACL2 User's Manual"
 nil
 nil
 (concat *acl2-sources-dir* "TAGS"))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that the first of these forms specifies the location of the 
 <span class="v">"TAGS-acl2-doc"</span> and <span class="v">"TAGS"</span> files mentioned above, but the second 
 only specifies <span class="v">"TAGS"</span> since the second form is for an ACL2-only manual 
 (no books).</p> 
 
 <p>If you want a specific manual to come up when you first run acl2-doc in an 
 Emacs session, you can put the following into your <span class="v">.emacs</span> file, where 
 <span class="v">'name</span> is the name a manual for which you have included a form 
 <span class="v">(extend-acl2-doc-manual-alist 'name ...)</span> in your <span class="v">.emacs</span> file.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(setq *acl2-doc-manual-name* 'name)</pre> 
 
 <h4>Color</h4> 
 
 <p>By default, links (indeed, any text) in square brackets will be shown in 
 blue.  You can customize this behavior by setting (e.g., in your <span class="v">.emacs</span> 
 file) the Emacs variable <span class="v">*acl2-doc-link-color*</span> to the desired link color, 
 or to <span class="v">nil</span> if you don't want the links to be in color.  For example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(setq *acl2-doc-link-color* "#FF0000") ; red
(setq *acl2-doc-link-color* "Green")   ; green
(setq *acl2-doc-link-color* nil)         ; no special color for links</pre> 
 
 <h4>Notes</h4> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>You might find that when you attempt to follow <a href="ACL2____SOME-BROKEN-LINK.html">some-broken-link</a>, 
 you find yourself at the <a href="ACL2____BROKEN-LINK.html">broken-link</a> topic.  If you are using the ACL2 
 User's Manual rather than the ACL2+Books Manual, the reason might be that 
 <span class="v">some-broken-link</span> is documented in a book, not in the ACL2 system.  In 
 that case, the <span class="v">broken-link</span> page will show you where to find that book; 
 but if you want to read the documentation for <span class="v">some-broken-link</span> in the 
 ACL2-Doc browser, you can do so by switching to the ACL2+Books Manual.  See 
 the <span class="v">I</span> command, documented above.<p></p>
</li> 
 
 <li>Files with names ending in <span class="tt">.acl2-doc</span> will come up in ACL2-Doc 
 mode.  Thus, you may wish to save a file with that extension, for example 
 <span class="tt">bookmarks.acl2-doc</span>, that contains your favorite bookmarks.  You may 
 wish to use the history command (<span class="tt">H</span>) to obtain a list of names of 
 visited topics, in order to create an initial such file.<p></p>
</li> 
 
 <li>Many commands offer defaults, and many offer completion.  The default is 
 determined by cursor position: if the cursor is sitting on a letter of a 
 documentation topic name, or on a space character immediately after it, then 
 that name will be offered as the default.  Completion tips:<p></p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>Completion is carried out with the usual emacs ``<span class="v">completing-read</span>''; 
 thus, for example, the character `<span class="v">?</span>' is a help key, so if you want that 
 character as part of your topic name, prefix it with <span class="v">control-q</span>.  For 
 example, after the `<span class="v">g</span>' command you can go to the topic <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV_F3.html">mv?</a></span> by 
 typing the character sequence <span class="v">&lt;m,v,control-q ?&gt;</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>To find completions that have package prefixes, type a colon (:) in the 
 front, and completion will show matching topics.  For example, <span class="v">"g"</span> 
 followed by <span class="v">":rew"</span> and then two tabs will show, at least in recent 
 versions of Emacs, a list of topics that includes 
 <span class="v">"ACL2-PC::REWRITE"</span>.</li> 
 
 </ul>
<p></p>
</li> 
 
 <li>Square brackets typically indicate documentation topic names, for example: 
 <span class="tt">[acl2-doc]</span>.  (As mentioned above, there are occasional exceptions, 
 where square brackets are simply part of the intended documentation text.) 
 The square brackets are really there, for example when you are searching using 
 "s", "S", or "n".  However, for purposes of determining the default 
 name (see above), the only effect of the enclosing square brackets is to 
 extend the region in which the default is offered.  For example, consider the 
 string "<span class="tt">[acl2-doc]</span>": the default name of "<span class="tt">acl2-doc</span>" is 
 offered if the cursor is on either square bracket.  But links have some 
 idiosyncrasies.<p></p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
   <li>Topic names, including links `<span class="tt">[..]</span>' to topic names, are printed 
   relative to the ACL2 package.  Especially in the case of the ACL2+Books 
   Manual, you may therefore see links that include package prefixes.  Here, 
   for example, is a sentence from the documentation for <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> in the 
   ACL2+Books Manual. 
 
   <pre class="code">We call these structures [gl::symbolic-objects]. 
   </pre> 
 
   The "<span class="tt">gl</span>" package prefix allows commands to pick up 
   "<span class="tt">gl::symbolic-objects</span>" as the name to use as a default, so that 
   for example, hitting <span class="v">&lt;Return&gt;</span> will take you to that topic.  But when 
   reading the sentence, for best results you should ignore package prefixes. 
   So for example, you would read the sentence above as follows. 
 
   <pre class="code">We call these structures symbolic-objects. 
   </pre>
<p></p>
</li> 
 
   <li>Inside ACL2-Doc, topic names that originally contained spaces now have 
   underscores in place of the spaces.  So for example, the topic <a href="ACL2____ACL2-TUTORIAL.html">ACL2-tutorial</a> in the ACL2+Books Manual contains a link to the topic 
   originally named as follows.<br> 
 
   <span class="v">|Pages Written Especially for the Tours|</span><br> 
 
   This link shows up in the ACL2-Doc browser as:<br> 
 
   <span class="v">[Pages_Written_Especially_for_the_Tours]</span>.</li> 
 
 </ol> 
 
 Of course, the web-based browser avoids these idiosyncrasies (see <a href="XDOC____SAVE.html">xdoc::save</a>); in particular, that browser is best for ``Tours'' pages like the 
 one shown above and its subtopics, in part because that way you may see 
 images.  Hence the web-based browser may be more appropriate for some topics, 
 and for those who have no particular preference for using Emacs to browse the 
 documentation.<p></p>
</li> 
 
 <li>Searching using the "s" or "S" command is carried out by searching 
 top-to-bottom in a hidden Emacs buffer that contains all of the 
 documentation.  The topics are listed in the following order according to 
 topic name:<p></p> 
 
   <ol> 
 
   <li>All topics whose names reside in the "<span class="tt">ACL2</span>" package;</li> 
 
   <li>All topics whose names reside in the "<span class="tt">ACL2-PC</span>" package; and, 
   for the ACL2+Books Manual,</li> 
 
   <li>All other topics, sorted by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> and then by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYMBOL-PACKAGE-NAME.html">symbol-package-name</a></span>.</li> 
 
   </ol>

 <li>You may be queried, regarding whether you want to browse the ACL2+Books 
 Manual, which is preferred, or the ACL2 User's Manual, which omits 
 documentation for the books.  Both of these manuals are based on files that 
 you will have if you are using a released version of ACL2 (after Version 6.3). 
 But if you are using a <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/" target="_blank"><nobr>git 
 version<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/"></nobr></a>, then to use the ACL2+Books Manual you will need an extra file. 
 You can build this file yourself, as described below but you may prefer to 
 download it: for example, when you start ACL2-Doc, you may be given the option 
 of downloading <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/rendered-doc-combined.lsp.gz" target="_blank"><nobr>a 
 tarball for the latest ``bleeding edge'' copy<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/rendered-doc-combined.lsp.gz"></nobr></a> and extracting into 
 directory <span class="v">system/doc/</span> of your community books directory.  Indeed, the 
 system will do all this for you if you answer <span class="v">y</span> to that query. 
 Alternatively, you can insist on a download of a ``bleeding edge'' version by 
 using the `<span class="tt">D</span>' command.  However, if you prefer to browse the ACL2 
 User's Manual (without the books), you can put the following form into your 
 <span class="tt">~/.emacs</span> file, above the form that loads the code for ACL2-Doc (see 
 above).<p></p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defvar *acl2-doc-manual-name* 'acl2-only)</pre> 
 
 If you prefer to build <span class="v">rendered-doc-combined.lsp</span> yourself, you can do so 
 as follows.<p></p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
   <li>Build ACL2: 
   <pre class="code">make</pre>
</li> 
 
   <li>Build the file <span class="v">books/system/doc/rendered-doc-combined.lsp</span> while 
   standing in the <span class="v">books/</span> directory, as follows.  If "<span class="tt">acl2</span>" 
   invokes the ACL2 executable that you just built, then you may omit 
   "<span class="tt">ACL2=acl2</span>" below; otherwise replace "<span class="tt">acl2</span>" by a 
   suitable executable.  On a multi-core machine you may wish to use <span class="v">-j</span>, 
   e.g., <span class="v">make -j 4 ...</span>. 
   <pre class="code">cd books
make doc/top.cert USE_QUICKLISP=1 ACL2=acl2</pre>
