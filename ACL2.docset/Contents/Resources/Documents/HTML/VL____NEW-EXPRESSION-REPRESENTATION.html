<p>Notes about the new expression representation in <a href="ACL2____VL.html">vl</a>, and how 
and why it diverges from the <a href="VL2014____EXPRESSIONS.html">vl2014::expressions</a>.</p><p>In earlier versions of VL such as <a href="ACL2____VL2014.html">vl2014</a>, we used a fairly 
<a href="VL2014____EXPRESSIONS.html">simple, AST-like representation</a>. 
This representation had some nice features: it kept mutual recursion to a 
minimum and made it easy to recur through expressions.  However, it also had 
some severe weaknesses.</p> 
 
<p>The most significant of these was the lack of type safety.  We often 
expected expressions to have certain shapes.  For instance, we typically 
expected that any hierarchical identifier, like <span class="v">foo.bar[2].baz</span>, would 
consist of special "hid pieces" joined together by certain "hid dot" and 
"hid array index" operators with a certain recursive structure.  But the 
expression representation did not enforce this, so nothing prevented you from 
creating nonsensical expressions like <span class="v">foo.(3 + 4).baz</span>.</p> 
 
<p>The ability to create degenerate/nonsense expressions is not necessarily so 
badâ€”just don't create nonsense expressions and what's the a problem?  But 
the possibility of these degenerate expressions might exist turned out to have 
a pervasive impact when writing code to process expressions: VL's many 
transforms and utilities always had to defend against such malformed 
expressions.</p> 
 
<p>This defense was generally carried out by adding guards or explicit run-time 
tests that expressions were sensible.  The result was copious error handling 
code, difficult and tedious proofs about well-formedness (e.g., see <a href="VL2014____WELLTYPED.html">vl2014::welltyped</a>), and additional interfacing layers such as the <a href="VL2014____HID-TOOLS.html">vl2014::hid-tools</a> to hide the problem.  These layers became ever more complex 
as we implemented more of SystemVerilog, e.g., scope expressions and datatype 
indexing greatly complicated the handling of hierarchical identifiers.</p> 
 
<p>Reflecting on these problems, and considering our improving ability to 
handle <a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a> via macro libraries such as <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fty</a> and 
<a href="ACL2____DEFINES.html">defines</a>, we decided to overhaul the expression representation and 
replace it with a much more strongly typed, mutually recursive approach.</p> 
 
<p>Our new expression format is much more complex than before.  However, it 
also intrinsically rules out many expressions that were previously allowed, 
which helps to avoid needing error checking code when processing expressions, 
and generally makes it easier to write safe expression-processing code.</p>
