 <p>The paper <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/papers/apply/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>``Limited 
 Second-Order Functionality in a First-Order Setting''<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/papers/apply/index.html"></nobr></a> by Matt Kaufmann and 
 J Strother Moore best explains the basic logical and practical ideas behind 
 <span class="v">apply$</span>.  We refer to the paper simply as ``the paper.''  Supplemental 
 material on the logical foundations of <span class="v">apply$</span> can be found in the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> directory <span class="v">books/projects/apply-model/</span>.  Also see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span> for detailed documentation on <span class="v">apply$</span> that complements the 
 introduction below, to be read carefully when you're ready to use <span class="v">apply$</span> 
 in your own projects.  We suggest that you not follow all the links in 
 introductory discussion and instead read it linearly as you might a paper.</p> 
 
 <p>The unreachable goal of this work is to allow the ACL2 user to pass 
 `functions' as objects and to apply them.  That goal is unreachable because 
 ACL2 remains a first order system.  However, we can identify a certain 
 syntactic class of ordinary ACL2 objects, called the `<a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a> 
 functions' (which are in fact <i>not</i> functions but are merely symbols and 
 list expressions) and we can allow names of functions with certain tameness 
 properties to be passed around and used as functions.</p> 
 
 <p>``Tameness'' imposes strict rules on how functional arguments are used. 
 We'll discuss it further below but tame functions are recognized by the 
 <span class="v">:logic</span> mode function <span class="v">tamep-functionp</span> and the paper gives explanatory 
 details.</p> 
 
 <p>The fundamental question raised by <span class="v">apply$</span> is ``How can <span class="v">apply$</span> 
 know the correspondence between an ordinary ACL2 object, like a symbol or a 
 list, and the ACL2 function the user means to apply?''  For example, if the 
 user defines the function <span class="v">my-append</span>, how can <span class="v">apply$</span> know that 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'MY-APPEND (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a b))</span> should expand to <span class="v">(my-append a b)</span>?</p> 
 
 <p>The ACL2 primitives can be built in.  The logical definition of <span class="v">apply$</span> 
 includes a big case split that recognizes about 800 ACL2 primitives, so that 
 for example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'car (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a)) = (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> a)</pre> 
 
 <p>and</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'assoc-equal (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a b)) = (<a href="ACL2____ASSOC-EQUAL.html">assoc-equal</a> a b).</pre> 
 
 <p>But user-defined functions are problematic because once <span class="v">apply$</span> has been 
 defined in the ACL2 sources it cannot be extended to handle new symbols.</p> 
 
  <p>Intuitively, if you have defined the <span class="v">n</span>-ary function <span class="v">foo</span> then you 
  would expect <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a1...an))</span> to be <span class="v">(foo a1...an)</span>.  One 
  way to arrange that might be to leave <span class="v">apply$</span> undefined on the symbol 
  <span class="v">foo</span> but to assume, as by an axiom or hypothesis,</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">forall a1...an : (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a1...an)) = (foo a1...an).</pre> 
 
  <p>It will turn out that using new axioms for this purpose is a bad idea. 
  Hiding the link between <span class="v">apply$</span> and new symbols in axioms raises a 
  problem with ACL2's notion of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>.  We illustrate this problem 
  later in this doc topic.  But for that reason, the suppositions extending 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> will take the form of hypotheses to be added to conjectures in 
  which the behavior of <span class="v">apply$</span> on new symbols is important.  These 
  hypotheses are called ``<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a></span>s.''</p> 
 
  <p>Warrant (Merriam-Webster): (noun) a commission or document giving 
  authority to do something....</p> 
 
  <p>In our case, a warrant for <span class="v">fn</span> gives <span class="v">apply$</span> permission to apply 
  <span class="v">fn</span> under some circumstances, by asserting a universally quantified 
  conditional equality about <span class="v">apply$</span>'s behavior on <span class="v">'fn</span>. It also tells 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> and the <a href="ACL2____TAME.html">tame</a>ness predicates things like how many arguments 
  <span class="v">fn</span> takes and how it uses them by asserting the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> of 
  <span class="v">'fn</span>.  The <span class="v">badge</span> of <span class="v">fn</span> is an ACL2 object that contains various 
  tokens interpretable by <span class="v">apply$</span> and the tameness predicates.</p> 
 
  <p>But there is a fundamental logical problem: it is not always possible to 
  satisfy such suppositions. There may be no way that <span class="v">apply$</span> could handle 
  <span class="v">fn</span>.  An example of a <span class="v">fn</span> for which that hypothesis is unsatisfiable 
  is</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> russell (x y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> y y)))).</pre> 
 
  <p>This definition of <span class="v">russell</span> is not recursive: it does not call itself. 
  So this definition is admissible.  But if we had a warrant for <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  and that <span class="v">warrant</span> were as simple as</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">forall x,y : (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'russell (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x y)) = (russell x y)</pre> 
 
  <p>then we would have this classical problem with self-reference:</p> 
  <pre class="code">(russell 'russell 'russell)
=                                      {def russell}
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'russell (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> 'russell 'russell)))
=                                      {warrant russell}
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (russell 'russell 'russell))</pre> 
 
  <p>which is contradictory.</p> 
 
  <p>This problem is addressed by introducing the notion of ``tameness.'' 
  Tameness is a syntactic property of terms and functions that implies that it 
  is ok to ``extend'' <span class="v">apply$</span> to handle them.</p> 
 
  <p>It should be pretty clear that if the user defines an ACL2 function that 
  in no way depends on <span class="v">apply$</span>, e.g., a function like:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sq (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x))</pre> 
 
  <p>then the hypothesis</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">forall x : (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'SQ (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x)) = (sq x)</pre> 
 
  <p>is satisfiable: we could have introduced <span class="v">sq</span> before <span class="v">apply$</span> and 
  then defined <span class="v">apply$</span> in the first place to handle that particular 
  symbol.</p> 
 
  <p><span class="v">Sq</span> is a particularly simple example of a tame function.  One 
  challenge in this work has been to extend the notion of tameness so that it 
  includes a lot of what a normal ACL2 programmer might want in <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  while maintaining the soundness of the resulting theory.</p> 
 
  <p>For example, consider the following function, which maps a given function 
  over a list and collects the results.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> collect$ (fn lst)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      nil
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)))
            (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>Our definition of tameness considers <span class="tt">(collect$ 'SQ lst)</span> to be a 
  tame expression, even though <span class="v">collect$</span> calls <span class="v">apply$</span>.  The reason we 
  can allow this is that in this particular call of <span class="v">collect$</span> the function 
  to be applied is itself tame.  But if <span class="tt">(collect$ 'SQ lst)</span> is a tame 
  expression, then <span class="tt">'(LAMBDA (LST) (COLLECT$ 'SQ LST))</span> is a tame 
  function and thus</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">LAMBDA</a> (LST) (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">COLLECT$</a> 'SQ LST)) z)</pre> 
 
  <p>is a tame expression.  So, for example, at the top-level of ACL2 one 
  can do this:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">LAMBDA</a> (LST) (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">COLLECT$</a> 'SQ LST))
                 '((1 2 3) (4 5 6) (7 8 9)))
((1 4 9) (16 25 36) (49 64 81))</pre> 
 
  <p>Of course, this presumes we have defined <span class="v">sq</span> and <span class="v">collect$</span> and have 
  analyzed them to make sure they have the appropriate tameness properties. 
  (Note that <span class="v">collect$</span> is not tame, but the way it uses its ``functional'' 
  argument is crucial to the tameness of <span class="tt">(collect$ 'SQ lst)</span>.)  To use 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> to full advantage we need to have analyzed every relevant 
  function definition so we know which arguments are treated like functions and 
  whether they are used in accordance with our restrictions.  So if you're 
  defining a function you intend to <span class="v">apply$</span> it is convenient to define it 
  with the new command <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a></span>, which is just an ordinary <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> 
  followed by a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a></span> command.  If you've already defined the 
  function and then realize you wish to <span class="v">apply$</span> it, you can call 
  <span class="v">defwarrant</span> yourself.</p> 
 
  <p><span class="v">Defwarrant</span> analyzes a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode definition and 
  produces a badge and a warrant, if possible.  Also relevant is the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFBADGE.html">defbadge</a></span> command which issues a badge for a function (if possible) but does 
  not issue a warrant.  Its primary purpose is to allow <span class="v">:</span><span class="v">program</span> mode 
  functions to analyzed and badged so they can be safely executed by 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> at the top-level ACL2 loop.  But the present discussion focuses 
  primarily on the logical machinery, which requires warrants.</p> 
 
  <p>We explain further via an annotated example, starting from scratch but 
  from the basic background just sketched.  For many additional examples, see 
  <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> <span class="v">books/projects/apply/report.lisp</span> which is a 
  certified book containing the examples in the paper.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Note carefully:</b> the directory <span class="v">books/projects/apply-model/</span>, 
  mentioned earlier in conjunction with the paper, is different from the 
  directory <span class="v">books/projects/apply/</span> just mentioned!  The former directory 
  concerns the logical foundations of <span class="v">apply$</span> as they stood when the paper 
  was written.  The latter is more directly relevant to ACL2 users and provides 
  useful lemmas about <span class="v">apply$</span> as it is axiomatized and implemented today. 
  It also includes many example theorems.</p> 
 
  <p>To get started, define two ordinary ACL2 functions, one that squares its 
  argument and the other that reverses its argument.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sq (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> rev (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> x)
      nil
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)))))</pre> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 0:</b> Learn about <span class="v">apply$</span> by reading this tutorial 
  introduction.  But this tutorial mentions many undefined concepts: tameness, 
  warrants, badges, ilks.  These concepts are intertwined with <span class="v">apply$</span> and 
  warrants through mutual recursion, constraints, rewrite rules, etc..  So we 
  decided not to try to define them here as we go along, though the links 
  provided do provide definitive descriptions.  So please tolerate the use of 
  undefined words here — we'll try to give you a sense of what they 
  mean.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 1:</b> To use <span class="v">apply$</span>, be sure to include the following book 
  of lemmas.  These lemmas are important not just to proving theorems about 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> but to defining functions that use <span class="v">apply$</span>.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "projects/apply/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 2:</b> To allow <span class="v">apply$</span> to ``work'' on a function symbol the 
  symbol must be ``warranted.''  Actually, of course, you can pass anything to 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> and the axioms will reduce it to some value: ACL2 is untyped and 
  all functions are total!  But <span class="v">apply$</span> won't work in the logic as you 
  expect if the first argument to <span class="v">apply$</span> is not warranted!  (And 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> won't work as you expect for top-level evaluation if its first 
  argument is not at least badged.)  To issue warrants (and badges) for <span class="v">sq</span> 
  and <span class="v">rev</span> do:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a> sq)

(<a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a> rev)</pre> 
 
  <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">Defwarrant</a></span> checks that its argument, <i>fn</i>, is a defined 
  function symbol that satisfies certain restrictions on how it uses its 
  arguments, restrictions that enable us to define the tameness predicates and 
  that allow <span class="v">apply$</span> to ``work'' without causing logical contradictions. 
  <span class="v">Defwarrant</span> causes an error if <i>fn</i> does not obey our rules.  But if 
  <span class="v">defwarrant</span> does not cause an error it produces a ``badge'' for <i>fn</i> 
  that describes which formals are treated as ``functions.''  Henceforth, we'll 
  say such formals have ``<a href="ACL2____ILK.html">ilk</a>'' <span class="v">:FN</span>.  In addition to computing a 
  badge, non-erroneous calls of <span class="v">defwarrant</span> produce a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a></span> for 
  <i>fn</i> that specifies the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> and the conditions under which 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> ``works'' on the function symbol <i>fn</i>.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 3:</b> We'll say more about tameness, badges, and warrants 
  later.  You already know that warrants can only be issued for <span class="v">:logic</span> 
  mode functions because the function symbol is used as a function in the 
  logical definition of the warrant.  But you might as well learn four major 
  limitations of <span class="v">apply$</span>: 
  (i) <span class="v">Apply$</span> does not take <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> or <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> arguments and so 
  cannot call any function that takes <span class="v">STATE</span> or <span class="v">stobj</span> arguments.  (ii) 
  <span class="v">Apply$</span> cannot call a function whose measure, well-founded relation, or 
  domain predicate depends on <span class="v">apply$</span>. (iii) <span class="v">Apply$</span> cannot call a 
  function that itself uses <span class="v">apply$</span> unless that function's measure is a 
  natural number or a lexicographic combination of naturals formed with 
  <span class="v">llist</span> as defined in the Community Books at <span class="v">books/ordinals/</span>. (iv) 
  <span class="v">Apply$</span> cannot call a function that itself uses <span class="v">apply$</span> if that 
  function was defined mutually recursively.  Another way of saying all this is 
  that <span class="v">defwarrant</span> will cause an error if you try to warrant a function 
  violating (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv).</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 4:</b> If you want to define a function and immediately call 
  <span class="v">defwarrant</span> on it you can use the handy macro <span class="v">defun$</span>.  We'll use 
  <span class="v">defun$</span> freely below.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 5:</b> You can define functions that take warranted 
  ``functions'' as arguments and <span class="v">apply$</span> them.  Here is a function that 
  applies its first argument to every element of its second argument and 
  collects the results.  We sometimes call functions like <span class="v">collect$</span> 
  ``mapping functions'' because they map another function over some range.  We 
  would call them ``functionals'' except that suggests ACL2 is higher-order and 
  it is not!  So we most often call them <a href="ACL2____SCION.html">scion</a>s of <span class="v">apply$</span>.  In 
  ordinary English usage, a ``scion'' is a descendent of an important family or 
  individual; our scions are ``descendents'' of <span class="v">apply$</span> and inherit its 
  power and restrictions.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> collect$ (fn lst)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      nil
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)))
            (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>In this definition, the first argument has ilk <span class="v">:FN</span> because it is used 
  exclusively as a ``function:'' it reaches the first argument of <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  and is untouched otherwise.  The second argument has ilk <span class="v">NIL</span> and we say 
  it's ``ordinary.''  It is <i>never</i> used as a function.</p> 
 
  <p>Note: We define <span class="v">collect$</span> with <span class="v">defun$</span> simply to illustrate 
  <span class="v">defun$</span>.  Unless we mean to pass <span class="v">collect$</span> to <span class="v">apply$</span> or to some 
  scion in the future, there is no reason to have a warrant for <span class="v">collect$</span>. 
  Had we defined <span class="v">collect$</span> with the ordinary <span class="v">defun</span> and realized later 
  that we want to pass <span class="v">'COLLECT$</span> into a slot of ilk <span class="v">:FN</span>, we could get 
  a warrant for <span class="v">collect$</span> by calling <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFWARRANT.html">defwarrant</a> collect$)</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>Here's another useful scion:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> always$ (fn lst)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      t
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)))
           (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>It checks that every element of <span class="v">lst</span> satisfies its <span class="v">:FN</span> argument 
  <span class="v">fn</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>By the way, both <span class="v">collect$</span> and <span class="v">always$</span> are pre-defined in 
  ACL2 because they are part of the support for the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span> statment.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 6:</b> You can run scions on warranted function symbols:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'SQ '(1 -2 3 -4))

((3 2 1) (6 5 4) (9 8 7))</pre> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 7:</b> You can run scions on tame quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects. 
  These are just quoted list expressions that start with the symbol <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> 
  and look like lambda-expressions.  But quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects have to 
  have fully translated bodies and meet other restrictions so <span class="v">apply$</span> can 
  interpret them.  You cannot use macros like <span class="v">+</span> or <span class="v">cond</span> and must you 
  quote all constants.  We urge you not to type quoted <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects by 
  hand!  Instead, we provide a macro, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a></span>, that allows you to write 
  in untranslated form as you would a lambda expression in ACL2.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 8:</b> There are three very similar looking but very different 
  notions used in this documentation: lambda expressions, <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> objects, 
  and <span class="v">lambda$</span> expressions.  Read carefully!  See <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a></span> for some

  <p><b>Lesson 9:</b> Almost all ACL2 primitives are known to <span class="v">apply$</span>.  For

  <p>You can freely use these ACL2 primitives with <span class="v">apply$</span> and in your 
  <span class="v">lambda$</span> expressions, without warrants.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 10:</b> You can prove and use theorems about scions.</p>

  <p>Notice that the lemma <span class="v">collect$-append</span> talks about an arbitrary 
  <span class="v">fn</span>.  The definition of <span class="v">apply$</span> is completely irrelevant to this 
  theorem!  Once <span class="v">collect$-append</span> has been proved can be instantiated with 
  anything for <span class="v">fn</span>.  This is demonstrated when the <span class="v">thm</span> above is 
  proved: the proof is just to rewrite with <span class="v">collect$-append</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 11:</b> But when your theorems depend on the behavior of 
  <span class="v">apply$</span> on particular user-defined functions, you will need to provide 
  hypotheses stipulating the behavior of <span class="v">apply$</span> on those values.  Those 
  hypotheses are the warrants for the (non-primitive) function symbols 
  involved.  Here is an example: If <span class="v">lst</span> is a list of integers and we 
  square every element by mapping over it with <span class="v">sq</span> then the result is a 
  list of naturals — but this theorem depends on the fact that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a>
  'SQ (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x))</span> is <span class="v">(sq x)</span>, which is what the warrant for <span class="v">sq</span> tells 
  us.  Thus, the warrant for <span class="v">sq</span> is required as a hypothesis!</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> all-natp-collect$-sq
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a> sq)
                (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'INTEGERP lst))
           (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'NATP (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'SQ lst))))</pre> 
 
  <p>Note that this theorem uses the scion <span class="v">always$</span> to express the ideas of 
  ``list of integers'' and ``list of naturals.''  Note also that we don't need 
  to provide warrants for <span class="v">integerp</span> or <span class="v">natp</span> because they are ACL2 
  primitives and thus built into the behavior of <span class="v">apply$</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 12:</b> Warrants solve the ``<span class="v">LOCAL</span> problem.''  Imagine the 
  trouble we'd be in if the theorem above did not require a warrant on <span class="v">sq</span>. 
  We could get away with this:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a> nil
  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sq (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x)))
  (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> unwarranted-all-natp-collect$-sq
    (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'INTEGERP lst)
             (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'NATP (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'SQ lst)))))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> sq (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x x))

(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'INTEGERP lst)
              (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'NATP (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'SQ lst))))</pre> 
 
  <p>This would be a disaster because the final <span class="v">thm</span> is invalid since 
  <span class="v">(sq -2)</span> here is <span class="v">-8</span> and yet the <span class="v">thm</span> is trivially proved by 
  appealing to the unwarranted theorem exported from the encapsulate.</p> 
 
  <p>If we could prove the unwarranted theorem we could export it because it 
  does not mention or depend on the function <span class="v">sq</span>, it just mentions the 
  constant <span class="tt">'SQ</span>.  Fortunately, we cannot actually prove the unwarranted 
  version of the theorem because there is no <i>a priori</i> connection between 
  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> 'SQ (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> x))</span> and <span class="v">(sq x)</span>.  And if we add the warrant for 
  <span class="v">sq</span> to the <span class="v">defthm</span> in the encapsulate we can prove the theorem but we 
  cannot export it because the warrant ancestrally depends on locally defined 
  function <span class="v">sq</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 13:</b> While we may have given the impression that we've 
  provided a convenient fragment of second-order functionality in ACL2 its 
  limitations will annoy you!  For example, when ACL2 tries to use the 
  lemma</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> all-natp-collect$-sq
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a> sq)
                (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'INTEGERP lst))
           (<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'NATP (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> 'SQ lst))))</pre> 
 
  <p>it just employs its usual first-order matching algorithm.  Thus, the lemma 
  won't apply to</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ALWAYS_42.html">always$</a> 'NATP (<a href="ACL2____COLLECT_42.html">collect$</a> (<a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a> (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x x)) lst))</pre> 
 
  <p>because the constant symbol <span class="tt">'SQ</span> is not the same as the constant 
  list generated by translating <span class="v">lambda$</span> expression, 
  <span class="tt"><span class="v">'(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">LAMBDA</a> (X) (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_A2.html">BINARY-*</a> X X))</span></span>, even though they are equivalent 
  if understood as functions.  See the discussion at <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FN-EQUAL.html">fn-equal</a></span>.</p> 
 
  <p><b>Lesson 14:</b> Recall Lesson 0!  Before you start to use <span class="v">apply$</span> 
  outside of this simple demo script, we advise you to read the documentation 
  for <span class="v">apply$</span>.</p> 
 
  <p><b>An Advanced Lesson:</b> We conclude this tutorial by defining one of 
  the most useful scions and proving a couple of theorems illustrating its 
  flexibility: <span class="v">foldr</span>.</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFUN_42.html">defun$</a> foldr (lst fn init)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      init
      (<a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a> fn
              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst)
                    (foldr (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst) fn init)))))</pre> 
 
  <p>Note that <span class="v">foldr</span> maps over the list in its first argument, applying 
  its second argument to two things: successive elements of the list and the 
  result of recursively calling itself on the rest of the list.  It returns its 
  third argument when the list is empty.</p> 
 
  <p>When its functional argument is <span class="v">cons</span> <span class="v">foldr</span> is just the 
  concatenation of its other two arguments:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> foldr-cons
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (foldr x 'cons y)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y)))</pre> 
 
  <p>We do not need a warrant for <span class="v">cons</span> because it is built into 
  <span class="v">apply$</span>.  In fact, the built-ins don't have warrants but if you 
  unnecessarily list a primitive in a <span class="v">warrant</span> expression, like <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a>
  foldr cons)</span>, it just ignores the primitives that are built into 
  <span class="v">apply$</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>By supplying a certain <span class="v">lambda</span> expression we can use <span class="v">foldr</span> to 
  reverse its first argument:</p> 
 
  <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> foldr-can-be-rev
  (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a> foldr)
           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (foldr x
                         (<a href="ACL2____LAMBDA_42.html">lambda$</a> (x y)
                            (foldr y 'cons (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x nil)))
                         nil)
                  (<a href="ACL2____REV.html">rev</a> x))))</pre> 
 
  <p>Note that the <span class="v">lambda$</span> expression calls <span class="v">foldr</span>.  Because of this, 
  we must provide the warrant for <span class="v">foldr</span> since that inner <span class="v">foldr</span> will 
  be applied by the outer <span class="v">foldr</span>.  This illustrates an important point: 
  scions can apply other scions, including themselves, as long as the 
  applications are tame.</p>
