<p>Display how many AIG gates are used in the symbolic representation of an object</p><p>Logically, this returns its second argument; its first argument 
should be a variable symbol.  This counts the number of AIG gates that are used 
in the symbolic representation of the object (second argument) and prints that 
out as a debugging message.</p> 
 
<p>If you want to do anything else with the gatecount, you can get that count 
using <span class="v">(gatecount! x)</span> under an <a href="FGL____UNEQUIV.html">unequiv</a> context, or using the binder 
form <span class="v">(gatecount free-var x)</span> in a rewrite rule.</p>
