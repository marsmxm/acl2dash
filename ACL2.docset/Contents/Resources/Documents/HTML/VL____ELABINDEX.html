<p>A data structure for recording elaboration results, i.e., functions, 
types, and parameters.</p> 
<h3>Basic Usage</h3> 
<ul> 
<li>
<a href="VL____VL-ELABINDEX-INIT.html">vl-elabindex-init</a> initializes an empty elabindex at the design scope.</li> 
<li>

<li>
<a href="VL____VL-ELABINDEX-TRAVERSE.html">vl-elabindex-traverse</a> traverses to the scope represented by the given scopestack.</li> 
<li>
<a href="VL____VL-ELABINDEX-PUSH.html">vl-elabindex-push</a> enters the given scope.</li> 
<li>
<a href="VL____VL-ELABINDEX-UNDO.html">vl-elabindex-undo</a> undoes the latest traversal/push that hasn't already been undone.</li> 
<li>
<a href="VL____VL-ELABINDEX-_E3SS.html">vl-elabindex-&gt;ss</a> accesses the scopestack of the current location</li> 
<li>
<a href="VL____VL-ELABINDEX-SYNC-SCOPES.html">vl-elabindex-sync-scopes</a> readies the scopes for 
read-only/applicative usage by ensuring that the versions of subscopes

<li>
<a href="VL____VL-ELABINDEX-_E3SCOPES.html">vl-elabindex-&gt;scopes</a> accesses the stack of elabinfo scopes for the 
current location.(Note: You should use <a href="VL____VL-ELABINDEX-SYNC-SCOPES.html">vl-elabindex-sync-scopes</a> before 
doing this.)</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>An elabindex is most useful when you are going to be adding new elaboration 
results.  To simply examine elaboration results, you may use a <a href="VL____VL-ELABSCOPES.html">vl-elabscopes</a>.  This is a data structure used in an elabindex, but also 
has a set of functions appropriate for using it in an applicative manner.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Introduction</h3> 
<p>One of the biggest difficulties in processing SystemVerilog is the 
complicated dependencies among functions, parameters, and types.  There is no 
way to unravel these dependencies so that we can (e.g.) resolve parameter 
values first, then types, then function definitions: in fact, each of these can 
depend on all the others.  So they must all be processed in one step, so that 
if a parameter depends on a function definition, we can go and resolve that 
function definition, which may depend on other parameters and types, before 
coming back to the original parameter with the function's resolved definition.</p> 
 
<p>The step that resolves all of these is called elaboration.  During 
elaboration, we unparameterize modules and traverse the design in order to 
resolve types and replace constant expressions with their values where 
possible.  Elaboration is complicated by the fact that there is no set order 
for dependencies; we must be able to go look up an arbitrary 
parameter/function/type anywhere in the module and resolve it before 
continuing.</p> 
 
<p>This style of traversal is difficult for our applicative-style data 
structures; when we go to a different part of the design, resolve something, 
and come back to another part of the design, it is expensive to record the 
result that we obtained in the design, especially since it has been 
processed (e.g.) a scopestack.</p> 
 
<p>An elabindex is our solution to this problem.  It is designed to allow us to 
efficiently record and look up results while performing both treelike and 
non-treelike traversals of the design.</p> 
 
<h3>Implementation</h3> 
 
<p>An elabindex contains a scopestack and an elabscopes.  A scopestack 
contains all the smarts necessary to look up items correctly (which can be 
nontrivial when you factor in imports, etc.).  The elabscopes contains 
analogous scopes as the scopestack, but these scopes record elaboration 
information and are designed to be easily updated, as well as the subscopes 
contained within.  To make writes to a scope permanent, each time we go up a 
scope, we pop the scope off of the elabscopes, but write it into the 
parent scope so that next time we go into that scope, we'll get our most recent 
updates.</p> 
 
<p>An exception to this: Some scopes are anonymous, e.g., a block statement 
inside an always block.  Such a scope can't be accessed by name from within the 
surrounding context -- it can only be reached through a treelike traversal, 
i.e., processing all the always blocks in a module.  When going up in scope 
from some such a scope, we don't write it to the parent scope because it 
doesn't have a name to index it by.</p> 
 
<p>A tricky use case: Suppose we are working in some anonymous scope, e.g., a 
block statement inside an always. Such a scope can't be accessed by name from 
within the surrounding context -- it can only be reached through a treelike 
traversal, i.e., processing all the always blocks in a module.  Then, suppose 
we need to look up some parameter located in a package.  We need to go into 
that parameter's context to compute its value, then pop back to our previous 
context.</p> 
 
<p>How can we accomplish this?  Some ideas and their flaws:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Keep a stack of checkpoints, i.e. before going to the package context, save 
our current elabscopes, and restore it when we're done computing the 
parameter.  Problem: we need to save the work we did to compute the parameter, 
so we can't just revert to our previous elabscopes.</li> 
 
<li>Keep a stack of paths that uniquely identify the current location.  When 
going to a new location, push the current location's path onto the stack, and 
when we want to come back to it, pop it off and navigate back to it.  Problem: 
anonymous scopes don't have names.  Also, going back to the top of the design 
to follow a path from the beginning might be inefficent -- we might even 
traverse to the same scope we were already in.  Since popping scopes involves 
writing to a fast alist, we don't want to do this unnecessarily.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Our actual implementation:</p> 
 
<p>Keep a stack of traversal instructions that say how to get back to the 
previous scope from the scope you reached.  Each such traversal is a sequence 
of instructions, where each instruction is one of:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Go up a scope</li> 
<li>Go down into the scope of some name</li> 
<li>Go down into this anonymous scope (where the scope itself is part of the 
instruction).</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Distinguishing between named and anonymous scopes in this way allows named 
scopes to be updated via "random access", i.e. following 
parameter/function/type dependencies.  Anonymous scopes don't need to be 
updated this way because parameter/function/type dependencies won't take you 
back to one.  (An exception, arguably, is a block scope inside a function 
definition.  But this should only matter if the function calls itself 
recursively, which we don't support for now anyway.)</p>
