<p>Create an SVTV structure for some simulation pattern of a hardware design.</p> 
 
<p>See the <a href="SV____SV-TUTORIAL.html">sv-tutorial</a> and the parent topic <a href="SV____SVEX-STVS.html">svex-stvs</a> for 
higher-level discussion; here, we provide a reference for the arguments.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:design</span> or <span class="v">:mod</span> provides the SVEX <a href="SV____DESIGN.html">design</a> object containing 
the hierarchical hardware model.  One or the other of <span class="v">:design</span> or <span class="v">:mod</span> 
should be given, but not both; they mean exactly the same thing.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:inputs</span> provide the stimulation pattern for inputs to the module, 
formatted as discussed in <a href="SV____SVTV-STIMULUS-FORMAT.html">svtv-stimulus-format</a>.  The argument is 
evaluated, so if you want to write your stimulus as a literal (as opposed to 
referencing a constant or generating it via a function call) you should put a 
quote in front of it; you may also use backquote syntax.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:overrides</span> are similar to <span class="v">:inputs</span> and take the same syntax, but 
are expected to refer to signals that are already driven.  For signals that are 
overridden, in the cycle that a variable or value is provided, that signal's 
driving expressions will be disconnected and it will instead be forced to the 
given value.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:outputs</span> and <span class="v">:internals</span> are treated interchangeably; both specify 
what signals should be extracted and at what phases of simulation.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:parents</span>, <span class="v">:short</span>, <span class="v">:long</span>, and <span class="v">:labels</span> pertain to 
documentation; if any of <span class="v">:parents</span>, <span class="v">:short</span>, or <span class="v">:long</span> are given 
then additional xdoc will also be generated to show a timing diagram. 
<span class="v">:labels</span>, if provided, label the phases in that timing diagram.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:simplify</span> is T by default; it can be set to NIL to avoid rewriting the 
output svex expressions, which may be desirable if you are doing a 
decomposition proof.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:initial-state-vars</span> is NIL by default; it can be set to T to set the 
initial state of the simulation to all free variables instead of all Xes.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:keep-final-state</span> is NIL by default; it can be set to T to store the 
state after the final phase in the SVTV as <span class="v">(<a href="SV____SVTV-_E3NEXTSTATE.html">svtv-&gt;nextstate</a> svtv)</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:keep-all-states</span> is NIL by default; it can be set to T to store the 
sequence of <span class="v">nphases+1</span> states in the SVTV as <span class="v">(<a href="SV____SVTV-_E3STATES.html">svtv-&gt;states</a> svtv)</span>.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">:state-machine</span> is NIL by default; if set to T, it is the same as 
setting <span class="v">:initial-state-vars</span> and <span class="v">keep-final-state</span> to T.</li> 
 
</ul>
