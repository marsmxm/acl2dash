<p>Print the macroexpansion of a form</p><pre class="code">Examples:
:trans (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a b c)
:trans (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADDR.html">caddr</a> x)
:trans (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> (p q) (r))</pre> 
 
 <p>This function takes one argument, an alleged term, and translates it, 
 expanding the macros in it completely.  Either an error is caused or the 
 formal meaning of the term is printed.  We also print the ``output signature'' 
 which indicates how many results are returned and which are single-threaded 
 objects.  For example, a term that returns one ordinary object (e.g., an 
 object other than <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> or a user-defined single-threaded object (see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a>)) has the output signature</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">=&gt; *</pre> 
 
 <p>A term that returns the single-threaded object <span class="v">STATE</span> has the output 
 signature</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">=&gt; STATE</pre> 
 
 <p>and a term that returns four results might have the output signature</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">=&gt; (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">MV</a> $MEM * * STATE)</pre> 
 
 <p>This signature indicates that the first result is the (user defined) 
 single-threaded object <span class="v">$MEM</span>, that the next two results are ordinary, and 
 that the last result is <span class="v">STATE</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____TRANS_12.html">trans!</a> for a corresponding command that does not enforce 
 restrictions of single-threaded objects.</p> 
 
 <p>It is sometimes more convenient to use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS1.html">trans1</a></span> which is like trans 
 but which only does top-level macroexpansion.</p>
