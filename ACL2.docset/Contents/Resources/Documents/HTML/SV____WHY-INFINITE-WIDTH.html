<p>Notes about our use of infinite-width vectors as the basis for our 
expression language.</p><p>It probably seems very odd to base the core of a hardware 
description language on infinite width vectors.  After all, in real hardware 
every wire and register will, of course, be of some particular, finite 
size.</p> 
 
<p>In HDLs like Verilog, every variable is always declared to have some 
particular width, and every operator like <span class="v">a + b</span> ultimately ends up being 
interpreted as having some fixed sizewell, at least after 
``elaboration'' is over.  As a concrete example to discuss, consider a Verilog 
fragment like the following:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire signed [3:0] a = ...;
wire [15:8] b = ...;
wire c = ...;
wire [7:0] ans = {8{c}} &amp; (a % b);</pre> 
 
<p>We can imagine developing vector-level expression languages that include 
size information.  This might be done, for instance, by having a kind of 
<b>context</b> that records the sizes and ranges of the various expressions, 
and then interpreting vector-level expressions in some way that is relative to 
this context.  For instance, our context might be some kind of structure that 
binds names to ranges/types, say:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">((a   (signed 3 0))
 (b   (unsigned 15 8))
 (c   (unsigned nil nil))
 (ans (unsigned 7 0)))</pre> 
 
<p>And given such a context, we could write functions to infer the widths of 
operators.  We might, for instance, represent the expression for <span class="v">ans</span> as 
something like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(bitand (<a href="ACL2____REPLICATE.html">replicate</a> 8 c) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MOD.html">mod</a> (cast-to-unsigned a) b))</pre> 
 
<p>And then, using the context, we would be able to see that this occurrence of 
<span class="v">mod</span> is an 8-bit operation, and its first argument <span class="v">a</span> needs to be 
zero-extended from 4 bits to 8 bits, and so on.  We might be able to use the 
context to type-check expressions and determine that certain expressions, like 
<span class="v">(bitsel 5 a)</span>, are invalid since <span class="v">5</span> is not a valid index into a wire 
from <span class="v">3</span> to <span class="v">0</span>.</p> 
 
<p>All of this might be a fine approach, but we have not pursued it.</p> 
 
<p>Instead, in our expression language, we adopt the convention that every 
variable represents an infinitely long, signed value.  The main consequence of 
this is that we do not need a context.  Instead, all size/signedness coercions 
become explicit in the expressions themselves.</p> 
 
<p>This seems like a strong advantage.  It means, for instance, that every 
expression can be understood, exactly, all by itself, without having to 
consider or look up any other information.</p>
