<p>Automatically generated usage message.</p><pre class="code">    -h,--help             Show a brief usage message and exit. 
--readme              Show a more elaborate README and exit. 
--outdir=DIR          Default is ".".  Controls where the 
                      translation files should be written. 
--model-file=NAME     Default is "model.sao".  Contains the main 
                      vl-translation-p object with E modules as 
                      well as copious other information about from 
                      the translation.  See the readme for details. 
                      To avoid writing this file, you can use the 
                      empty string, i.e., --model-file ''. 
--esims-file=NAME     Default is "esims.sao".  Contains just the E 
                      modules, and is typically much smaller than 
                      model.sao.  To avoid writing this file, you 
                      can use the empty string, i.e., --esims-file 
                      ''. 
--verilog-file=NAME   Default is "vl_model.v".  Contains a 
                      "simplified" version of some subset of the 
                      input Verilog modules.  To avoid writing this 
                      file, use the empty string, i.e., 
                      --verilog-file ''. 
-s,--search=DIR       Control the search path for finding modules. 
                      You can give this switch multiple times, to 
                      set up multiple search paths in priority 
                      order. 
-I,--incdir=DIR       Control the list of directories for `include 
                      files.  You can give this switch multiple 
                      times.  By default, we look only in the 
                      current directory. 
--searchext=EXT       Control the search extensions for finding 
                      modules.  You can give this switch multiple 
                      times.  By default we just look for files 
                      named "foo.v" in the --search directories. 
                      But if you have Verilog files with different 
                      extensions, this won't work, so you can add 
                      these extensions here.  EXT should not 
                      include the period, e.g., use "--searchext 
                      vv" to consider files like "foo.vv", etc. 
-D,--define=VAR       Set up definitions to use before parsing 
                      begins.  Equivalent to putting `define VAR 1 
                      at the top of your Verilog file.  You can 
                      give this option multiple times. 
--unroll=LIMIT        Set the maximum number of times to unroll 
                      loops to LIMIT.  Default: 100. 
--drop=MOD            Delete MOD from the module hierarchy before 
                      doing any simplification.  This is a gross 
                      (but effective) way to work through any bugs 
                      in VL that cause hard errors and are 
                      triggered by certain modules.  We will fail 
                      to model anything that depends on the dropped 
                      modules. 
--edition=EDITION     Which edition of the Verilog standard to 
                      implement?  Default: "SystemVerilog" (IEEE 
                      1800-2012).  You can alternately use 
                      "Verilog" for IEEE 1364-2005, i.e., 
                      Verilog-2005. 
--strict              Disable VL extensions to Verilog. 
-m,--mem=GB           How much memory to try to use.  Default: 4 
                      GB.  Raising this may improve performance by 
                      avoiding garbage collection.  To avoid 
                      swapping, keep this below (physical_memory - 
                      2 GB). 
--mustfail=MOD        Print a failure message and exit with status 
                      1 if MOD is translated successfully.  This 
                      option is mainly meant for running tests to 
                      ensure that VL is properly rejecting bad 
                      constructs.  You can give this option 
                      multiple times. 
--mustget=MOD         Print a failure message and exit with status 
                      1 if MOD is not translated successfully.  You 
                      can give this option multiple times.
