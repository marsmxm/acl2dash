<p>Restrictions on parse trees that correspond to 
          how the parser of ABNF grammars resolves the <span class="v">rulelist</span> ambiguity.</p><p>As explained in the documentation of the <a href="ABNF____GRAMMAR-PARSER-IMPLEMENTATION.html">grammar parser implementation</a>, the <span class="v">rulelist</span> ambiguity is naturally resolved 
     by having <span class="tt"><a href="ABNF____PARSE-_A2CWSP.html">parse-*cwsp</a></span> parse as many <span class="v">c-wsp</span>s as possible, 
     like the other <span class="v">parse-*...</span> parsing functions. 
     This means that the parser generates only parse trees 
     whose <span class="v">(*c-wsp c-nl)</span> subtrees of <span class="v">rulelist</span> trees 
     do not start with <span class="v">WSP</span>s, 
     because such <span class="v">WSP</span>s always go 
     under the immediately preceding <span class="v">rule</span> or <span class="v">(*c-wsp c-nl)</span> 
     during parsing; 
     except that if the <span class="v">rulelist</span> starts with a <span class="v">(*c-wsp c-nl)</span>, 
     that subtree may start with <span class="v">WSP</span>, 
     since there is no preceding <span class="v">rule</span> or <span class="v">(*c-wsp c-nl)</span>.</p><p>The following predicates capture these restrictions. 
     They characterize the parse trees generated by the parser. 
     The completeness of the parser is, necessarily, 
     proved relatively to these restrictions.</p>
