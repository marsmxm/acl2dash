<p>Routines for saving ACL2 objects to files, and later restoring them</p><p>We thank Jared Davis for contributing the ``serialization'' 
 routines for saving ACL2 objects in files for later loading.</p> 
 
 <p>We implement some routines for writing arbitrary ACL2 objects to files, and 
 for loading those files later.  We usually call these ".sao" files, which 
 stands for (S)erialized (A)CL2 (O)bject.</p> 
 
 <p>Our serialization scheme uses a compact, binary format that preserves 
 structure sharing in the original object.  We optimize for read 
 performance.</p>
