<p>Enable the use of concrete execution of a function in FGL rewriting.</p><p>This sets the entry for the given function in the <span class="v">fgl-fn-modes</span> 
table so that it can be concretely executed when a call of that function on 
concrete values is encountered in FGL rewriting.  This is the default setting, 
but use of this event can counteract previous uses of <a href="FGL____DISABLE-EXECUTION.html">disable-execution</a>.</p>
