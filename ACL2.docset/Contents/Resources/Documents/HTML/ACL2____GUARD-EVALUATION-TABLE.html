<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____GUARD-EVALUATION-TABLE">Click for Guard-evaluation-table in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A table that shows combinations of <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>s and <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>-checking</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> for an introduction to the topic 
 discussed here.  Also see <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> for a general discussion of guards, and 
 see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-EVALUATION-EXAMPLES-SCRIPT.html">guard-evaluation-examples-script</a> for a script that illustrates 
 combinations presented below.</p> 
 
 <p>Note: The default setting for guard-checking (that is, the initial value 
 for <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> guard-checking-on)</span>) is <span class="v">T</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The table below illustrates the interaction of the <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a> with 
 the value supplied to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span>.  The first row considers 
 functions defined in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode; the other two consider 
 functions defined in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode.  The columns correspond to four 
 values of state global <span class="v">'guard-checking-on</span>, as supplied to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span>.  (A fifth value, <span class="v">:nowarn</span>, is similar to <span class="v">t</span> but 
 suppresses warnings; a remark with details for system hackers is at the end of 
 this topic.)  Note that <span class="v">'guard-checking-on</span> is set to <span class="v">nil</span> during 
 proofs but is set to <span class="v">t</span> during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, regardless of how this variable has been set in the top-level 
 loop (see the ``Essay on Guard Checking'' in source file 
 <span class="v">other-events.lisp</span> if you are interested in a rationale).</p> 
 
 <p>Below this table, we make some comments about its entries, ordered by row 
 and then by column.  For example, when we refer to ``b2'' we are discussing 
 the execution of a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode function whose guards have not 
 been verified, after having executed <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span><span class="v">
 :all</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">  guard-checking-on:  (1)t      (2):all   (3):none   (4)nil

(a) :program             a1        a2        a3        a4
(b) guards not verified  b1        b2        b3        b4
(c) guards verified      c1        c2        c3        c4</pre> 
 
 <p>a1. Check the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> upon entry, then use the raw Lisp code if the 
 guard checks (else cause an error).  This is a common setting when one wants a 
 little guard checking but also wants the efficiency of raw Lisp.  But note 
 that you can get raw Lisp errors.  For example, if you make the definition 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span> in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode and execute 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span><span class="v"> t</span>, and then execute <span class="v">(foo 3)</span>, you 
 will likely get an error from the call <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> 3)</span> made in raw Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>a2. For built-in (predefined) functions, see a1 instead. 
 Otherwise:<br> 
 
 Check the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>, without exception.  Thus, we never run the raw Lisp 
 code in this case.  This can be useful when testing <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode 
 functions, but you may want to run <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span><span class="v"> t</span> or at least 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span><span class="v"> :exec</span> in this case, so that the execution is done 
 using compiled code.</p> 
 
 <p>a3. For built-in (predefined) functions, see a4 instead. 
 Otherwise:<br> 
 
 Do not check the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>.  For <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions, we 
 never run the raw Lisp code in this case; so if you care about efficiency, see 
 the comment in a2 above about <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span>.  This combination is useful 
 if you are using ACL2 as a programming language and do not want to prove 
 theorems about your functions or suffer <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> violations.  In this 
 case, you can forget about any connection between ACL2 and Common Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p>a4. Run the raw Lisp code without checking <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s at all.  Thus, for 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode functions, the <span class="v">nil</span> setting is often preferable 
 to the <span class="v">:none</span> setting because you get the efficiency of raw Lisp 
 execution.  However, with <span class="v">nil</span> you can therefore get hard Lisp errors as 
 in a1 above.</p> 
 
 <p>b1. Guards are checked at the top-level, though not at self-recursive 
 calls.  We never run the raw Lisp code in this case; guards would need to be 
 verified first.</p> 
 
 <p>b2. Unlike the <span class="v">t</span> setting, guards are checked even on self-recursive 
 calls.  But like the <span class="v">t</span> setting, we do not run the raw Lisp code.  Use 
 this setting if you want guards checked on each recursive call in spite of the 
 cost of doing so.</p> 
 
 <p>b3, b4. Execution avoids the raw Lisp code and never checks guards.  The 
 <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">:none</span> settings behave the same in this case (i.e., for 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode functions whose guards have not been verified), 
 except that recursive calls are never inlined for <span class="v">:none</span> and tracing (see 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____TRACE.html">trace</a>) will show recursive calls for <span class="v">:none</span> but not for 
 <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>c1, c2. Guards are checked.  If the checks pass, evaluation takes place 
 using the raw Lisp code.  If the checks fail, we get a guard violation. 
 Either way, we do not execute ``in the logic''; we only execute using the raw 
 Lisp code.  Note that <span class="v">t</span> and <span class="v">:all</span> behave the same in this case, 
 (i.e. for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode functions whose <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s have been 
 verified).</p> 
 
 <p>c3, c4. For the <span class="v">:none</span> and <span class="v">nil</span> settings, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode 
 functions whose guards have been verified will never cause guard violations. 
 However, with <span class="v">nil</span> and for built-in functions in <span class="v">:logic</span> mode, guards 
 are still checked: if the check succeeds, then evaluation is done using the 
 raw Lisp code, and if not, it is done by the ``logic'' code, including 
 self-recursive calls (though unlike the <span class="v">t</span> case, we will not see a warning 
 about this).  But with <span class="v">:none</span> for user-defined functions, no guard 
 checking is done, and the only time the raw Lisp code will be executed is when 
 the guard is <span class="v">t</span> and guards are verified at the time the 
 executable-counterpart of the function is defined (i.e., when the function is 
 admitted unless it is later defined again and compiled using <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span>).  Thus, if you use <span class="v">:none</span> and you want a function <span class="v">(foo x)</span> with 
 guard <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x)</span> to execute using raw Lisp code, you can write a 
 ``wrapper''function with a guard of <span class="v">t</span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo-wrap (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> x)
      (foo x)
    'do-not-case))</pre> 
 
 <p>If you want the speed of executing raw Lisp code and you have non-trivial 
 guards on functions that you want to call at the top-level, use <span class="v">nil</span> 
 rather than <span class="v">:none</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Remark for system hackers.  As noted above, a fifth value, <span class="v">:nowarn</span>, is 
 similar to <span class="v">t</span> but suppresses warnings.  Only the four values in the column 
 headers above and <span class="v">:nowarn</span> are legal for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a></span>, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-GUARD-CHECKING.html">with-guard-checking</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-GUARD-CHECKING-ERROR-TRIPLE.html">with-guard-checking-error-triple</a></span>, and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-GUARD-CHECKING-EVENT.html">with-guard-checking-event</a></span>.  Behavior is technically undefined if you 
 set <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global <span class="v">guard-checking-on</span> directly to other than those 
 five values, say using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____F-PUT-GLOBAL.html">f-put-global</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE-GLOBAL-LET_A2.html">state-global-let*</a></span>.  However, as of this writing (in August 2021), such a 
 value will cause the same behavior as value <span class="v">:nowarn</span>.  End of 
 Remark.</p>
