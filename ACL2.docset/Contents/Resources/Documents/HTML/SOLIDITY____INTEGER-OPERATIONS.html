<p>Integer operations [<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/types.html#integers" target="_blank"><nobr>SD: Types: Integers<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/types.html#integers"></nobr></a>].</p><p>If a binary operator is applied to operands of different types, 
     there is an (attempted) implicit conversion 
     from the type of one operand to the type of the other operand [<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/types.html#implicit-conversions" target="_blank"><nobr>SD: Types: Conversions between Elementary Types: Implicit Conversions<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/types.html#implicit-conversions"></nobr></a>]. Thus, once the operator is actually applied to the two operand values, 
     the implicit conversion must have succeeded 
     and thus the values must have the same time. 
     Therefore, the ACL2 functions that model binary integer operations 
     have guards requiring the two operands to have the same type 
     (i.e. the same signedness and the same size).</p><p>However, the requirement above that the operands of a binary operator 
     always are of, or can be converted to, the same type, 
     may need to be relaxed for some operations. 
     The wording in [<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/types.html#exponentiation" target="_blank"><nobr>SD: Types: Integers: Exponentiation<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/types.html#exponentiation"></nobr></a>] and [<a href="https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/types.html#shifts" target="_blank"><nobr>SD: Types: Integers: Shifts<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7.0/types.html#shifts"></nobr></a>] suggests that operands may have different types for these operations, 
     in a way that no conversion to a common type may be possible.</p><p>For now we strictly follow the same-rule type, 
     and therefore must exclude exponentiation and shifts on signed integers. 
     However, we may need to adjust our formalization as noted above, 
     and add exponentiation and shifts involving signed integers 
     (for their first operands only, not their second operands.</p>
