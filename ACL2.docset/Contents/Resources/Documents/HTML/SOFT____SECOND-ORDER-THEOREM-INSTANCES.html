<p>Notion of instance of a second-order theorem.</p><p>An instance of a second-order theorem is an ACL2 theorem 
     introduced via <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFTHM-INST.html">defthm-inst</a></span>, 
     which replaces function variables that the second-order theorem depends on 
     with functions of matching arities. 
     This macro specifies the replacement as an 
     <a href="SOFT____FUNCTION-VARIABLE-INSTANTIATION.html">instantiation</a>, 
     which is applied to the formula of the second-order theorem.</p><p>The new theorem is second-order if it still depends on function variables, 
     otherwise it is first-order. 
     <span class="tt"><a href="SOFT____DEFTHM-INST.html">defthm-inst</a></span> generates a proof for the new theorem 
     that uses a <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION.html">functional 
     instance</a> of the second-order theorem that is being instantiated.</p>
