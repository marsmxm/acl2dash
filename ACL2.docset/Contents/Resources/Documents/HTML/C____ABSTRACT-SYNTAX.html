<p>A preliminary abstract syntax of C.</p><p>This abstract syntax is preliminary in the sense that 
     it is neither general nor complete. 
     It is not general because it assumes the use of ASCII characters. 
     which is not necessarily the case according to [C]. 
     It is not complete because it does not cover all the C constructs. 
     Nonetheless, it covers a useful and interesting subset of C, 
     with the ASCII assumption being largely supported 
     (as part of perhaps a larger character set like Unicode).</p><p>We plan to generalize and extend this abstract syntax 
     to not make specific assumptions and to cover all the C constructs. 
     In particular, we plan to use the formalization of <a href="C____CHARACTER-SETS.html">character sets</a> to lift the ASCII assumption.</p><p>This abstract syntax models C code after preprocessing. 
     As part of a more comprehensive formalization of C, 
     we also plan to formalize abstract syntax before preprocessing, 
     and in fact to formalize the translation phases [C:5.1.1.2] in detail.</p>
