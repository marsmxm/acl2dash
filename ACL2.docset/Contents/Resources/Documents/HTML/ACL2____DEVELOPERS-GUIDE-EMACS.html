<p>Emacs As a Critical Tool for ACL2 Developers</p><p>Emacs has traditionally been used by ACL2 system developers.  In 
 principle, any text editor would suffice.  But as of this writing, we don't 
 know how to maintain ACL2 effectively without using Emacs.  It is not the goal 
 here to give an Emacs tutorial; but here are some Emacs utilities that are 
 particularly useful to ACL2 developers.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">meta-.</span><br>Move to the indicated definition in the ACL2 sources (must 
 initialize with <span class="v">meta-x visit-tags-table</span>).  This is much faster than 
 bringing up the file in an editor and searching for the definition.  Use a 
 prefix argument to find the next match if desired.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">meta-x tags-apropos</span><br>Bring up all symbols whose definition matches 
 the given regular expression.  One can find a suitable such symbol and use 
 <span class="v">meta-.</span> to go rapidly to its definition.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">meta-x tags-search</span><br>Find an occurrence of a given regular 
 expression, using <span class="v">meta-,</span> to find subsequent occurrences.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">meta-x tags-query-replace</span><br>Replace occurrences of a given regular 
 expression with a given string, with a query each time, using <span class="v">meta-,</span> to 
 find subsequent occurrences.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">meta-x compare-windows</span><br>After splitting the window in two 
 (say, with <span class="v">control-x 2</span>), compare the upper window with the lower.  This 
 is particularly useful when comparing two versions of some source code, for 
 example, the original version and a modified version.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>The file <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> has many helpful utilities, so you may 
 want to load it in your <span class="v">~/.emacs</span> file.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>For example, it defines <span class="v">ctl-t w</span> as a shortcut for <span class="v">meta-x
 compare-windows</span>, and it defines <span class="v">ctl-t q</span> to do the same thing but 
 ignoring whitespace (by providing a prefix argument for <span class="v">meta-x
 compare-windows</span>).</li> 
 
 <li>
<font color="#c00000">Maintain <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> with taste: avoid using fancy Emacs Lisp 
 code that could be difficult for others to maintain.</font>  If one is competent at 
 maintaining the ACL2 sources base, then a little Emacs Lisp competence should 
 be sufficient for maintaining <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span> as well.  So avoid 
 fancy Emacs features not already found in use in that file.</li> 
 
 </ul>
