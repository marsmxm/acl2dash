<p>To pop up (at least) one level of ACL2's command loop</p><p>Logically speaking, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____P_12.html">p!</a>) = nil</span>.  If you are already at the top 
 level of the ACL2 command loop, rather than being in a subsidiary call of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>, then the keyword then a call of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____P_12.html">p!</a>)</span> returns <span class="v">nil</span> and has 
 no other effect.</p> 
 
 <p>Otherwise, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____P_12.html">p!</a>)</span> is evaluated inside a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> that was made 
 inside ACL2's command loop.  In that case, the current computation is aborted 
 and treating as causing an error, and control returns to the superior call of 
 <span class="v">ld</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is a more detailed description of the effect of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____P_12.html">p!</a>)</span> when not at 
 the top level of the ACL2 command loop.  The current call of <span class="v">LD</span> is 
 treated as though <span class="v">ld-error-action</span> is <span class="v">:RETURN!</span> (the default; here we 
 ignore the case <span class="v">(:exit N)</span>) and hence immediately returns control to the 
 superior call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>.  If all calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> were made with the 
 default <span class="v">ld-error-action</span> of <span class="v">:RETURN!</span>, then all superior calls of 
 <span class="v">ld</span> will then complete until you are back at top level of the ACL2 loop. 
 For more information, see <a href="ACL2____LD-ERROR-ACTION.html">ld-error-action</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>If you are at an ACL2 prompt (as opposed to a raw Lisp break), then you may 
 type <span class="v">:p!</span> in place of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____P_12.html">p!</a>)</span>; see <a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-COMMANDS.html">keyword-commands</a>.</p>
