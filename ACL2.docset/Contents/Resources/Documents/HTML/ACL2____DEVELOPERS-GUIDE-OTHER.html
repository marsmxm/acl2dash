<p>Topics Not Covered</p><p>There are many aspects of the ACL2 implementation, even major ones, 
 that aren't covered in this Development Guide.</p> 
 
 <h3>It's perfectly OK that this Guide is incomplete!</h3> 
 
 <p>ACL2 has been maintained for more than 25 years by people who don't recall 
 very much about large portions of the source code, probably the majority of 
 it.  The key is that when making changes, one explores relevant code, reading 
 relevant user-level documentation and code comments (including Essays), and 
 talking with other developer(s) about questions and issues.  System 
 maintenance generally gets easier with experience.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is a partial list of topics, in no particular order, that are left 
 uncovered by this guide, or largely so: <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPROXY.html">defproxy</a></span> and (except for brief 
 mention) <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a></span>; <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s, including nested stobjs and 
 abstract stobjs; <a href="ACL2____ARRAYS.html">arrays</a>; hons, memoization, and fast-alists (see <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>); the <a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE.html">serialize</a> reader and writer; <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>; <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span>; <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a>functions and <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>s; <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>, including <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a>, default 
 hints, <a href="ACL2____OVERRIDE-HINTS.html">override-hints</a>, and custom keyword hints; <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a>s; 
 printing, including evisceration (see <a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a>), <a href="ACL2____IPRINTING.html">iprinting</a>, 
 pretty-printing, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PRINT-OBJECT_42.html">print-object$</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-OUTPUT.html">with-output</a></span>; <a href="ACL2____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a>s and <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION.html">functional-instantiation</a>; the 
 <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> system; the prover, including the <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL.html">waterfall</a>, the 
 rewriter (for example <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a>, congruences and patterned 
 congruences, the <a href="ACL2____REWRITE-CACHE.html">rewrite-cache</a>, etc.), the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a>, <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a>, and much more; pathnames, including <a href="ACL2____CANONICAL-PATHNAME.html">canonical-pathname</a>s; <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> and <a href="ACL2____FUNCTIONAL-INSTANTIATION.html">functional-instantiation</a>, 
 including the <span class="v">proved-functional-instances-alist</span>; the <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>; and certifying and including <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  And this is only a 
 partial list!</p> 
 
 <p>But again, the Guide is not intended to be complete.  In principle, at 
 least, you can learn about any of the topics above when necessary, by reading 
 user-level documentation and using the Emacs tags-search and <span class="v">meta-.</span> 
 commands to find relevant code, and comments, and in particular, essays.</p> 
 
 <h3>Expanding this Guide</h3> 
 
 <p>Perhaps this Guide will be expanded in the future.  If so, the expansion 
 should probably not duplicate code comments, but rather, provide overview 
 information and perspective with pointers to those comments.</p>
