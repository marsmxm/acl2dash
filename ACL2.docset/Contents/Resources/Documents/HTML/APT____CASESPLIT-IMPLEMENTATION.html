<p>Implementation of <span class="tt"><a href="APT____CASESPLIT.html">casesplit</a></span>.</p><p>The implementation functions have arguments, 
                        as well as results (in the <a href="STD____RETURNS-SPECIFIERS.html"><span class="v">:returns</span> specifiers</a>), consistently named as follows:</p><ul>
<li>
<span class="v">state</span> is the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">wrld</span> is the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">ctx</span> is the <a href="ACL2____CTX.html">context</a> used for errors.</li>

   <span class="v">thm-enable</span>, 
   <span class="v">verify-guards</span>, 
   <span class="v">hints</span>, 
   <span class="v">print</span>, and 
   <span class="v">show-only</span> 
   are the homonymous inputs to <span class="tt"><a href="APT____CASESPLIT.html">casesplit</a></span>, 
   before being processed. 
   These formal parameters have no types because they may be any values.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">call</span> is the call to <span class="tt"><a href="APT____CASESPLIT.html">casesplit</a></span> supplied by the user.</li>

   <span class="v">conditions$</span>,

   <span class="v">hints$</span>, 
   <span class="v">print$</span>, and 
   <span class="v">show-only$</span> 
   are the results of processing 
   the homonymous inputs (without the <span class="v">$</span>) to <span class="tt"><a href="APT____CASESPLIT.html">casesplit</a></span>. 
   Some are identical to the corresponding inputs, 
   but they have types implied by their successful validation, 
   performed when they are processed.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">hyps</span> is the list <span class="v">(hyp1 ... hypp hyp0)</span> of hypotheses 
   of the theorems named in the <span class="v">theorems</span> input, in the same order.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">news</span> is the list <span class="v">(new1 ... newp new0)</span> of right-hand sides 
   of the theorems named in the <span class="v">theorems</span> input, in the same order.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">appcond-thm-names</span> is an alist 
   from the keywords that identify the applicability conditions 
   to the corresponding generated theorem names.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">new-unnorm-name</span> is the name of the generated theorem 
   that installs the non-normalized definition of the new function.</li>
<li>
<span class="v">names-to-avoid</span> is a cumulative list of names of generated events, 
   used to ensure the absence of name clashes in the generated events.</li>
</ul><p>Implementation functions' arguments and results 
                        that are not listed above 
                        are described in, or clear from, 
                        those functions' documentation.</p>
