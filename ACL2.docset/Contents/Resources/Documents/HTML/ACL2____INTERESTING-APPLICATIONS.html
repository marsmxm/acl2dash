<p>Some industrial examples of ACL2 use</p><p>ACL2 is an interactive system in which you can model digital 
 artifacts and guide the system to mathematical proofs about the behavior of 
 those models.  It has been used at such places as AMD, Centaur, IBM, and 
 Rockwell Collins to verify interesting properties of commercial designs.  It 
 has been used to verify properties of models of microprocessors, microcode, 
 the Sun Java Virtual Machine, operating system kernels, other verifiers, and 
 interesting algorithms.</p> 
 
 <p>Here we list just a few of the industrially-relevant results obtained with 
 ACL2.  Reading the list may help you decide you want to learn how to use ACL2. 
 If you do decide you want to learn more, we recommend that you take <a href="ACL2____The_02Tours.html">The Tours</a> after you leave this page.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 was used at <b>Motorola Government Systems</b> to certify several 
 microcode programs for the <b>Motorola CAP digital signal processor</b>, 
 including a comparator sort program that is particularly subtle. In the same 
 project, ACL2 was used to model the CAP at both the pipelined architectural 
 level and the instruction set level.  The architectural model was bit- and 
 cycle-accurate: it could be used to predict every bit of memory on every 
 cycle.  The models were proved equivalent under certain hypotheses, the most 
 important being a predicate that analyzed the microcode for certain pipeline 
 hazards. This predicate defined what the hazards were, syntactically, and the 
 equivalence of the two models established the correctness of this syntactic 
 characterization of hazards.  Because ACL2 is a functional programming 
 language, the ACL2 models and the hazard predicate could be executed.  ACL2 
 executed a microcode interpreter several times faster than the hardware 
 simulator could execute it — with assurance that the answers were 
 equivalent.  In addition, the ACL2 hazard predicate was executed on over fifty 
 microcode programs written by Motorola engineers and extracted from the ROM 
 mechanically. Hazards were found in some of these.  (See, for example, Bishop 
 Brock and Warren. A. Hunt, Jr. ``Formal analysis of the Motorola CAP DSP.'' In 
 <i>Industrial-Strength Formal Methods</i>. Springer-Verlag, 1999.)</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 was used at <b>Advanced Micro Devices</b> (AMD) to verify the 
 compliance of the <b>AMD Athlon</b>'s (TM) elementary floating point operations 
 with their IEEE 754 specifications. This followed ground-breaking work in 1995 
 when ACL2 was used to prove the correctness of the microcode for 
 floating-point division on the <b>AMD K5</b>. The AMD Athlon work proved 
 addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and square root compliant 
 with the IEEE standard. Bugs were found in RTL designs. These bugs had 
 survived undetected in hundreds of millions of tests but were uncovered by 
 ACL2 proof attempts. The RTL in the fabricated Athlon FPU has been 
 mechanically verified by ACL2.  Similar ACL2 proofs have been carried out for 
 every major AMD FPU design fabricated since the Athlon.  (See for example, 
 David Russinoff. ``A mechanically checked proof of correctness of the AMD5K86 
 floating-point square root microcode''.  <i>Formal Methods in System 
 Design</i> Special Issue on Arithmetic Circuits, 1997.)</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 was used at <b>IBM</b> to verify the floating point divide and square 
 root on the <b>IBM Power 4</b>.  (See Jun Sawada. ``Formal verification of 
 divide and square root algorithms using series calculation''. In 
 <i>Proceedings of the ACL2 Workshop 2002</i>, Grenoble, April 2002.)</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 was used to verify floating-point addition/subtraction instructions 
 for the <b>media unit</b> from <b>Centaur Technology</b>'s 64-bit, 
 X86-compatible microprocessor. This unit implements over one hundred 
 instructions, with the most complex being floating-point 
 addition/subtraction. The media unit can add/subtract four pairs of 
 floating-point numbers every clock cycle with an industry-leading two-cycle 
 latency. The media unit was modeled by translating its Verilog design into an 
 HDL deeply embedded in the ACL2 logic. The proofs used a combination of AIG- 
 and BDD-based symbolic simulation, case splitting, and theorem proving.  (See 
 Warren A. Hunt, Jr. and Sol Swords. ``Centaur Technology Media Unit 
 Verification''. In <i>CAV '09: Proceedings of the 21st International</i> 
 <b>Conference on Computer Aided Verification</b>, pages 353–367, Berlin, 
 Heidelberg, 2009. Springer-Verlag.)</p> 
 
 <p><b>Rockwell Collins</b> used ACL2 to prove information flow properties 
 about its <b>Advanced Architecture MicroProcessor 7 Government Version 
 (AAMP7G)</b>, a Multiple Independent Levels of Security (MILS) device for use 
 in cryptographic applications. The AAMP7G provides MILS capability via a 
 verified secure hardware-based separation kernel. The AAMP7G's design was 
 proved to achieve MILS using ACL2, in accordance with the standards set by 
 EAL-7 of the Common Criteria and Rockwell Collins has received National 
 Security Agency (NSA) certification for the device based on this work.  (See 
 Matthew M. Wilding, David A. Greve, Raymond J. Richards, and David S. Hardin. 
 ``Formal Verification of Partition Management for the AAMP7G 
 Microprocessor''. In <i>Design and Verification of Microprocessor Systems for 
 High-Assurance Applications</i>, David S. Hardin, ed., pages 175–191, 
 Springer US, 2010.)</p> 
 
 <p>Key properties of the <b>Sun Java Virtual Machine</b> and its <b>bytecode 
 verifier</b> were verified in ACL2. Among the properties proved were that 
 certain invariants are maintained by <b>class loading</b> and that the 
 bytecode verifier ensures that execution is safe. In addition, various <b>JVM 
 bytecode programs</b> have been verified using this model of the JVM.  (See 
 Hanbing Liu. <i>Formal Specification and</i> <i>Verification of a JVM and its 
 Bytecode Verifier</i>. PhD thesis, University of Texas at Austin, 2006.)</p> 
 
 <p>The <b>Boyer-Moore fast string searching algorithm</b> was verified with 
 ACL2, including a model of the JVM bytecode for the search algorithm itself 
 (but not the preprocessing).  (See J S. Moore and Matt Martinez. ``A 
 mechanically checked proof of the correctness of the Boyer-Moore fast string 
 searching algorithm.'' In <i>Engineering Methods and Tools for Software Safety 
 and Security</i> pages 267–284. IOS Press, 2009.)</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 was used to verify the fidelity between an <b>ACL2-like theorem 
 prover</b> and a simple (``trusted by inspection'') <b>proof checker</b>, 
 thereby establishing (up to the soundness of ACL2) the soundness of the 
 ACL2-like theorem prover.  This project was only part of a much larger project 
 in which the resulting ACL2 proof script was then hand-massaged into a script 
 suitable for the ACL2-like theorem prover to process, generating a formal 
 proof of its fidelity that has been checked by the trusted proof checker. 
 (See Jared Davis.  <i>Milawa: A Self-Verifying Theorem Prover</i>. 
 Ph.D. Thesis, University of Texas at Austin, December, 2009.)</p>
