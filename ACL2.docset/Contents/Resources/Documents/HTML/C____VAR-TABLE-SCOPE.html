<p>Fixtype of scopes of variable tables.</p><p>A variable table is a symbol table for variables. 
     The table (see <span class="tt"><a href="C____VAR-TABLE.html">var-table</a></span>) is organized as 
     a sequence with one element for each nested block scope [C:6.2.1]. 
     This <span class="v">var-table-scope</span> fixtype 
     contains information about such a block scope. 
     The information is organized as a finite map 
     from identifiers (variable names) to types. 
     Using a map is adequate because 
     all the variables declared in a block must have different names 
     [C:6.2.1/2].</p>
