<p>Historic alternatives to the <a href="ACL2____SERIALIZE.html">serialize</a> routines.</p><p>Routines <span class="v">compact-print-file</span> and <span class="v">compact-read-file</span> were 
 previously built into ACL2.  Another option was to use the <span class="v">hons-archive</span> 
 library.  These tools were deprecated and ultimately removed from ACL2.  If 
 for some reason you need to use them, see <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> SVN revisions 
 prior to 1314.</p>
