<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=FTY____DEFBYTE">Click for Defbyte in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Introduce a <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fixtype</a> of 
          unsigned or signed bytes of a specified size.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Currently fixtypes can only be associated to unary predicates, 
     but <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">signed-byte-p</a></span> 
     are binary predicates.</p><p>This macro introduces unary recognizers, and associated fixtypes, 
     of unsigned or signed bytes of specified sizes. 
     It also generates various theorems, 
     including some that relate 
     the unary recognizers to the binary predicates.</p><p>Besides their use in fixtypes, 
     the unary recognizers introduced by this macro support <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau system</a> reasoning.</p><h3>General Form</h3><pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFBYTE.html">defbyte</a> type

  )</pre><h3>Inputs</h3><p><span class="v">:type</span></p><blockquote><p>A symbol that specifies the name of the fixtype.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:size</span></p><blockquote>
<p>A term that specifies the size of the bytes in bits. 
      This must be one of the following: 
      (1) an explicit positive integer value; 
      (2) a named constant whose value is a positive integer; 
      (3) a call of a nullary function (defined or constrained) 
      that is guard-verified and provably denotes a positive integer.</p>
<p>This input must be supplied; there is no default.</p>
</blockquote><p><span class="v">:signed</span></p><blockquote><p>A boolean that specifies whether the bytes are 
      unsigned (<span class="v">nil</span>, the default) or signed (<span class="v">t</span>).</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:pred</span></p><blockquote><p>A symbol that specifies the name of the fixtype's recognizer. 
      If this is <span class="v">nil</span> (the default), 
      the name of the recognizer is <span class="v">type</span> followed by <span class="v">-p</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:fix</span></p><blockquote><p>A symbol that specifies the name of the fixtype's fixer. 
      If this is <span class="v">nil</span> (the default), 
      the name of the fixer is <span class="v">type</span> followed by <span class="v">-fix</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:equiv</span></p><blockquote><p>A symbol that specifies the name of the fixtype's equivalence. 
      If this is <span class="v">nil</span> (the default), 
      the name of the equivalence is <span class="v">type</span> followed by <span class="v">-equiv</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">:parents</span><br><span class="v">:short</span><br><span class="v">:long</span></p><blockquote><p>These, if present, are added to 
      the XDOC topic generated for the fixtype.</p></blockquote><h3>Generated Events</h3><p><span class="v">pred</span></p><blockquote>
<p>The recognizer for the fixtype, guard-verified.</p>
<p>As a special case, if a function with this name already exists, 
      it is not (re-)generated. 
      This is mainly to accomodate the existing recognizers 
      <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BYTEP.html">ACL2::bytep</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NIBBLEP.html">ACL2::nibblep</a></span>, 
      but it is a more general mechanism.</p>
</blockquote><p><span class="v">booleanp-of-pred</span></p><blockquote>
<p>A rewrite rule saying that <span class="v">pred</span> is boolean-valued.</p>
<p>If <span class="v">pred</span> already exists (see above), 
      it is assumed that a theorem like this already exists as well: 
      thus, this theorem is not (re-)generated.</p>
</blockquote><p><span class="v">pred-forward-binpred</span></p><blockquote><p>A forward chaining rule from <span class="v">pred</span> 
      to the corresponding binary predicate 
      <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">signed-byte-p</a></span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">binpred-rewrite-pred</span></p><blockquote><p>A rule that rewrites the binary predicate 
      <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">signed-byte-p</a></span> 
      to <span class="v">pred</span>. 
      This rule is disabled by default, but may be useful in some proofs. 
      Since this is the converse of the definition of the unary recognizer, 
      a theory invariant is also generated preventing the enabling of 
      both this rule and the definition of the unary recognizer.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">pred-compound-recognizer</span></p><blockquote><p>A compound recognizer rule from <span class="v">pred</span> 
      to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a></span> (if the <span class="v">:signed</span> input is <span class="v">nil</span> 
      or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a></span> (if the <span class="v">:signed</span> input is <span class="v">t</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">fix</span></p><blockquote>
<p>The fixer for the fixtype, guard-verified.</p>
<p>It fixes values outside of <span class="v">pred</span> to 0.</p>
</blockquote><p><span class="v">pred-of-fix</span></p><blockquote><p>A rewrite rule saying that <span class="v">fix</span> always returns 
      a value that satisfies <span class="v">pred</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">fix-when-pred</span></p><blockquote><p>A rewrite rule saying that <span class="v">fix</span> disappears 
      when its argument satisfies <span class="v">pred</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">type</span> 
     <br> 
     <span class="v">equiv</span></p><blockquote><p>The fixtype, via a call of <span class="tt"><a href="FTY____DEFFIXTYPE.html">deffixtype</a></span> 
      that also introduces the equivalence <span class="v">equiv</span>.</p></blockquote><p><span class="v">type-size-is-posp</span></p><blockquote><p>When the <span class="v">size</span> input is a unary function call, 
      we also generate a rewrite and type prescription rule saying that 
      the unary function call satisfies <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POSP.html">posp</a></span>.</p></blockquote><p>The above items are generated with XDOC documentation. 
     If <span class="v">pred</span> already exists (see above), 
     it is assumed that an XDOC topic with the same name exists as well: 
     thus, a subtopic of it is generated, 
     named <span class="v">pred-additional-theorems</span> 
     and containing the theorems associated to <span class="v">pred</span>.</p>
