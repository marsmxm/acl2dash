<p>Proof by decomposing and re-composing a hardware model</p> 
 
<p>Part of the <a href="SV____SV-TUTORIAL.html">sv-tutorial</a>. Previous section: <a href="SV____PROOFS-WITH-STVS.html">proofs-with-stvs</a>.</p> 
 
 
<p>Certain kinds of hardware models aren't amenable to direct verification by 
bit-blasting because the function computed is too hard for SAT solvers/BDD 
packages.  Multipliers, most significantly, fall into this category -- 
expressing a multiplier function as BDDs always results in exponential memory 
usage, and they are notoriously difficult for SAT solvers to handle as well.  A 
standard trick for verifying a multiplier is to split the design into two or 
more parts, specifying separately how each of the parts should behave; prove 
 (by bit-blasting or automatic methods) that each of the parts matches its 
specification, and prove (by traditional theorem-proving methods) that the 
composition of the spec functions is equivalent to the spec for the whole 
module.</p> 
 
<p>The file "boothpipe.lisp" where this documentation topic is defined 
contains an example to show how to do this with SVEX.  In this topic we will 
discuss a few critical parts of the process, but for a more complete picture 
see that file and the comments in it.</p> 
 
<h4>STV Setup for Decomposition</h4> 
 
<p>In the boothpipe example, the intermediate signals to split the pipeline on 
are the partial products <span class="v">pp0</span>...<span class="v">pp7</span>.  We'll have one STV that says how 
to run the whole module, and about which we'll prove the final theorem -- we'll 
call this the Direct model.  We'll additionally define one STV that extracts 
the partial products given the circuit inputs -- Part 1 -- and one STV that 
takes the partial products as inputs and gets the outputs -- Part 2.</p>

<h4>Composing the Proof</h4> 
 
<p>The basic steps for completing the top-level proof we want are as 
follows:</p> 
 
<ol> 
<li>Prove that Part 1 meets its spec.</li> 
<li>Prove that Part 2 meets its spec.</li> 
<li>Prove that the composition of the Part 1 and Part 2 hardware models are 
equivalent to the Direct model.</li> 
<li>Prove that the composition of the spec for Part 1 and the spec for Part 2 
equals the top-level spec.</li> 
<li>Put steps 1 through 4 together to prove that the Direct model meets the 
top-level spec.</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p>Steps 1 and 2 can be done via bit-blasting proofs as discussed in the 
previous section of the tutorial (<a href="SV____PROOFS-WITH-STVS.html">proofs-with-stvs</a>).  Steps 4 and 5 are 
done using traditional theorem proving.  So here we'll focus on Step 3, for 
which the svex package provides some automation.</p> 
 
<h4>Hardware Recomposition Proof Automation</h4> 
 
<p>The hardware recomposition proof for the boothpipe example is shown 
below:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a>
 boothpipe-decomp-is-boothpipe
 (<a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a>
   ((out-alist1 (<a href="ACL2____SVTV-RUN.html">svtv-run</a> (<a href="SV____BOOTHPIPE-STEP1.html">boothpipe-step1</a>) in-alist))
    (in-alist2
         (boothpipe-step2-env-autoins (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> out-alist1 in-alist)))
    (out-alist2 (<a href="ACL2____SVTV-RUN.html">svtv-run</a> (<a href="SV____BOOTHPIPE-STEP2.html">boothpipe-step2</a>) in-alist2))
    (orig-in-alist in-alist)
    (orig-out-alist (<a href="ACL2____SVTV-RUN.html">svtv-run</a> (<a href="SV____BOOTHPIPE-DIRECT.html">boothpipe-direct</a>)
                              orig-in-alist)))
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="SV____SVEX-ENV-LOOKUP.html">svex-env-lookup</a> 'o out-alist2)
          (<a href="SV____SVEX-ENV-LOOKUP.html">svex-env-lookup</a> 'o orig-out-alist)))
 :hints ((svtv-decomp-hints)))</pre> 
 
<p>In this theorem, we show that running Step 1 followed by Step 2 results in 
the same result as running the whole model (Direct).  The steps followed by the 
<span class="v">b*</span> form work as follows: First we run Step 1 on an arbitrary input alist 
<span class="v">in-alist</span> to get <span class="v">out-alist1</span>.  To create the input to Step 2, we need 
some output signals from Step 1 along with some input signals that are common 
to both steps (namely <span class="v">en</span>), so we append <span class="v">out-alist1</span> and <span class="v">in-alist</span> 
and extract <span class="v">in-alist2</span> from that union, then run Step 2 to get 
<span class="v">out-alist2</span>.  Finally, we run the Direct model on the original input alist 
and compare its output to that of <span class="v">out-alist2</span>.</p> 
 
<p>We used to suggest a computed hint <span class="v">svdecomp-hints</span> as the best method 
for doing these decomposition proofs.  We describe that below (see "Older 
Method").  But this method requires equivalence checking between SVEX 
expressions, which sometimes is very fast but occasionally can be prohibitive 
for large designs.  The current suggested proof method is as follows.</p> 
 
<p>When using the "new" SVTV package (i.e. <a href="SV____DEFSVTV_42.html">defsvtv$</a> rather than <a href="ACL2____DEFSVTV.html">defsvtv</a>), it can be shown that the pipeline function (<span class="v">svtv-&gt;outexprs</span>) is 
an unrolling of a finite state machine under a particular set of inputs. This 
can be proved by the <a href="SV____DEF-PIPELINE-THM.html">def-pipeline-thm</a> event:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="SV____DEF-PIPELINE-THM.html">def-pipeline-thm</a> boothpipe-direct)</pre> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="SV____DEF-PIPELINE-THM.html">def-pipeline-thm</a> boothpipe-step1
                  :cycle-name boothpipe-direct-cycle)</pre> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="SV____DEF-PIPELINE-THM.html">def-pipeline-thm</a> boothpipe-step2
                  :cycle-name boothpipe-direct-cycle)</pre> 
 
<p>These three theorems express the <span class="v">svtv-&gt;outexprs</span> of the three SVTVs in 
terms of the same FSM, <span class="v">boothpipe-direct-cycle</span>.</p> 
 
<p>To prove the recomposition theorem, we then want to show that the specific 
sequence of steps of that cycle is consistent between the combined runs of 
steps 1 and 2 and the direct run.  Once unrolled into a sequence of nested 
evaluations of the next-state function of the cycle, the only discrepancy comes 
from the cycle where the step 2 run overrides the partial products with the 
results from the step 1 run. That is, the composed run has a call like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="SV____SVEX-ALIST-EVAL.html">svex-alist-eval</a>
 (<a href="SV____BASE-FSM-_E3NEXTSTATE.html">base-fsm-&gt;nextstate</a> (boothpipe-direct-cycle))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a>
  (<a href="SV____SVEX-ALIST-EVAL.html">svex-alist-eval</a>
   (<a href="SV____BASE-FSM-_E3NEXTSTATE.html">base-fsm-&gt;nextstate</a> (boothpipe-direct-cycle))
   ...)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST_A2.html">list*</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> "en" (<a href="SV____4VEC-CONCAT.html">4vec-concat</a> 1 (<a href="SV____SVEX-ENV-LOOKUP.html">svex-env-lookup</a> 'en in-alist) '(0 . -1)))
         '("clk" 0 . -2)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> '(:var "pp01_c2" . -6)
                ...
                (<a href="SV____SVEX-EVAL.html">svex-eval</a>
                 (<a href="SV____SVEX-LOOKUP.html">svex-lookup</a> "pp01_c2" (<a href="SV____BASE-FSM-_E3VALUES.html">base-fsm-&gt;values</a> (boothpipe-direct-cycle)))
                 ...) ...)
         ...
         '((:var "pp01_c2" . -7) . (#xFFFFFFFFF . -1))
         ...)))</pre> 
<p>Whereas the direct run instead has a step like this:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="SV____SVEX-ALIST-EVAL.html">svex-alist-eval</a>
 (<a href="SV____BASE-FSM-_E3NEXTSTATE.html">base-fsm-&gt;nextstate</a> (boothpipe-direct-cycle))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a>
  (<a href="SV____SVEX-ALIST-EVAL.html">svex-alist-eval</a>
   (<a href="SV____BASE-FSM-_E3NEXTSTATE.html">base-fsm-&gt;nextstate</a> (boothpipe-direct-cycle))
   ...)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST_A2.html">list*</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> "en" (<a href="SV____4VEC-CONCAT.html">4vec-concat</a> 1 (<a href="SV____SVEX-ENV-LOOKUP.html">svex-env-lookup</a> 'en in-alist) '(0 . -1)))
         '("clk" 0 . -2))))</pre> 
 
<p>The composition has several override value variables such as 
<span class="v">(:var "pp01_c2" . -6)</span> and override test variables such as 
<span class="v">(:var "pp01_c2" . -7)</span> bound (the -6 and -7 are just bitwise encodings of 
several switches pertaining to the variable, including whether it is an 
override value or override test variable).  The bindings for these variables 
are taken from the step 1 run. What we need to show is that overriding this 
variable with its value from the step 1 run does not change the result of the 
evaluation.  We can show this with a syntactic check using the function 
<span class="v">svexlist-check-overridetriples</span>, as shown by the theorem 
<span class="v">remove-override-vars-when-svexlist-check-overridetriples</span>.  This theorem 
says that if we have a set of triples <span class="v">(test-var value-var value-expr)</span> and 
the test variable and value variable only occur in the form <span class="v">(bit!? test-var
value-var value-expr)</span> in the expressions to be evaluated, then all of the 
triples' test and value variables may be removed from the environment without 
affecting the evaluation of the expressions, if the environment binds each 
<span class="v">value-var</span> to the result of evaluating the <span class="v">value-expr</span>.  This is 
exactly the criterion satisfied by these compositions.  We use a variation on 
this theorem, 
<span class="v">svtv-decomp-remove-override-vars-from-svex-alist-eval-when-svexlist-check-overridetriples</span>, 
which detects when an evaluation environment binds some override test variables 
and uses them to create a list of triples suitable for 
<span class="v">svexlist-check-overridetriples</span>.  However, in order to create the 
appropriate list of triples we need to declare ahead of time what FSM we are 
taking the values from, which we do as follows:</p> 
 <pre class="code">(set-svtv-decomp-main-fsm boothpipe-direct-cycle)</pre> 
 
<p>The proof of <span class="v">boothpipe-decomp-is-boothpipe</span> and similar theorems are 
automated with a computed hint <span class="v">(svtv-decomp-hints)</span>.  This computed hint 
macro takes two arguments <span class="v">:enables</span> and <span class="v">:disables</span>, each a list of rules 
that should be enabled/disabled in the first simplification phase of the 
proof.</p> 
 
 
<h4>Older Method for Recomposition Proof Automation</h4> 
 
<p>The computed hint <span class="v">svdecomp-hints</span> used to prove this theorem is 
documented in <a href="SV____SVEX-DECOMP.html">svex-decomp</a>.  In most cases, it suffices to give the hint 
form the two keyword arguments provided: <span class="v">:hyp</span> and <span class="v">:bindings</span>, which 
usually should be the autohyps and autobindings for the whole (Direct) model. 
Also, it is generally best to be in SAT mode rather than BDD mode for this type 
of proof; good performance of this proof relies on the fact that it is 
comparing two very similar formulas -- this is very helpful for SAT, but 
doesn't matter for BDDs, which will just build the (expensive) representations 
for both entire formulas and compare them.</p>
