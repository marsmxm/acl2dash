<p>Representation of <span class="v">repeat</span> constructs in intra-assignment delays.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>expr — <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The number of times to repeat the control, e.g., <span class="v">3</span> in the below 
          example.</dd> 
 
<dt>ctrl — <a href="VL2014____VL-EVENTCONTROL.html">vl-eventcontrol</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Says which event to wait for, e.g., <span class="v">@(posedge clk)</span> in the below 
          example.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>See Section 9.7.7 of the Verilog-2005 standard.  These are used to 
represent special intra-assignment delays, where the assignment should not 
occur until some number of occurrences of an event.  For instance:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">a = repeat(3) @(posedge clk)   &lt;-- repeat expr ctrl
      b;                       &lt;-- statement to repeat</pre> 
 
<p><b>BOZO</b> Consider consolidating all of these different kinds of 
controls into a single, unified representation.  E.g., you could at 
least extend eventcontrol with a maybe-expr that is its count, and get 
rid of repeateventcontrol.</p>
