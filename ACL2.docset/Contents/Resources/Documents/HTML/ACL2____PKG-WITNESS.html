<p>Return a specific symbol in the indicated package</p><p>For any string <span class="v">pkg</span> that names a package currently known to 
 ACL2, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PKG-WITNESS.html">pkg-witness</a> pkg)</span> is a symbol in that package whose <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> is the value of constant <span class="v">*pkg-witness-name*</span>.  Logically, 
 this is the case even if the package is not currently known to ACL2.  However, 
 if <span class="v">pkg-witness</span> is called on a string that is not the name of a package 
 known to ACL2, a hard Lisp error will result.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PKG-WITNESS.html">Pkg-witness</a> pkg)</span> has a guard of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a> pkg) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> pkg
 "")))</span>.  If <span class="v">pkg</span> is not a string, then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PKG-WITNESS.html">pkg-witness</a> pkg)</span> is equal 
 to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PKG-WITNESS.html">pkg-witness</a> "ACL2")</span></p>
