<p>Sequential sequence composition, i.e., <span class="v">foo ##1 bar</span> and similar.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">deftagsum</a> in support of <a href="VL____VL-PROPEXPR.html">vl-propexpr</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>delay — <a href="VL____VL-RANGE.html">vl-range</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The delay or range part between the two sequences.  Note that 
              SystemVerilog gives a rich syntax here which we always boil down 
              to a range.  In particular, a single expression like <span class="v">##1</span> is 
              represented with the range #('[1:1]').  The SystemVerilog syntax 
              <span class="v">##[*]</span> just means <span class="v">##[0:$]</span> and the syntax <span class="v">##[+]</span> just 
              means <span class="v">##[1:$]</span>.  Dollar signs are supposed to mean the end of 
              simulation, or for formal tools are supposed to mean some finite 
              but unbounded range.</dd> 
 
<dt>left — <a href="VL____VL-PROPEXPR.html">vl-propexpr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Left-hand side sequence to match, e.g., <span class="v">foo</span>.</dd> 
 
<dt>right — <a href="VL____VL-PROPEXPR.html">vl-propexpr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Right-hand side sequence to match, e.g., <span class="v">bar</span>.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>Note that in SystemVerilog you can write sequences that don't have 
            a starting expression, e.g., you can just write <span class="v">##1 foo ##1 bar</span>. 
            In this case, we set <span class="v">left</span> to the expression <span class="v">1</span>, which always 
            evaluates to true and hence has no effect on the sequence.</p>
