<p>Fixtype of renamings.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>list â€” <a href="YUL____IDENTIFIER-IDENTIFIER-ALIST.html">identifier-identifier-alist</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><h5>Additional Requirements</h5><p>The following invariant is enforced on the fields:</p><pre class="code">(and (no-duplicatesp-equal (strip-cars list)) 
     (no-duplicatesp-equal (strip-cdrs list))) 
</pre><p>These are alists from identifiers to identifiers 
     that have unique keys and unique values, 
     which we treat as lists of pairs rather than as alist as such 
     (see discussion in <a href="YUL____RENAMING-VARIABLES.html">renaming-variables</a>). 
     We wrap the alist into a one-component product type 
     and we add constraints for key and value uniqueness.</p><p>We use this to capture variable renamings, 
     but it can be also used for function renamings. 
     We will put this into a more general place 
     and also use this for function renamings.</p>
