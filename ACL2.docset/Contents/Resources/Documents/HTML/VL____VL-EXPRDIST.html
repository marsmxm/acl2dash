<p>Representation of <span class="v">expr dist { ... }</span> constructs.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>expr — <a href="VL____VL-EXPR.html">vl-expr</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The left-hand side expression, which per SystemVerilog-2012 Section 
          18.5.4 should involve at least one <span class="v">rand</span> variable.</dd> 
 
<dt>dist — <a href="VL____VL-DISTLIST.html">vl-distlist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The desired ranges of values and probability distribution.  May be 
          <span class="v">nil</span> in case of a plain expression without any <span class="v">dist</span> 
          part.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>Very confusingly, the <span class="v">dist</span> operator is mentioned in the 
SystemVerilog-2012 precedence table (Table 11-2, Page 221).  This doesn't 
make any sense because per the grammar rules it only occurs within</p> 
 
<pre class="code">expression_or_dist ::= expression [ 'dist' { dist_list } ]</pre> 
 
<p>And these <span class="v">expression_or_dist</span> things definitely do not occur within 
other expressions.  After some investigation, I believe this inclusion in 
the table is simply misleading and that the right way to treat <span class="v">dist</span> is 
as a separate construct rather than as a real operator.  See also the file 
<span class="v">vl/parser/tests/distprec.sv</span> for related notes and experiments.</p>
