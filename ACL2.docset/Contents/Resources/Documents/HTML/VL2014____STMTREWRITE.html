<p>Rewrite statements into simpler forms.</p><p>This transform simplifies Verilog statements by applying rewrite 
rules.  The idea is to make later statement processing simpler by reducing the 
variety of statements that need to be supported.  This is somewhat similar to 
how the <a href="VL2014____OPREWRITE.html">oprewrite</a> transform eliminates certain operators, leaving us 
with fewer operators to support later on.  See <a href="VL2014____ALWAYS-TOP.html">always-top</a> for how this 
fits into our overall handling of <span class="v">always</span> blocks.</p> 
 
<p>Note that, for instance, our rewrites eliminate <span class="v">$display</span> statements. 
This is suitable when your goal is to analyze the functionality of the module 
from a synthesis/build perspective, e.g., with <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>.  But it is 
obviously <b>not suitable</b> if you want to use the resulting modules with a 
Verilog simulator.</p> 
 
<p>Notes:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>This transform should typically be run after <a href="VL2014____UNPARAMETERIZATION.html">unparameterization</a> so 
that, e.g., width parameters will have been propagated.  For instance, things 
like <span class="v">repeat (n) body</span> won't get unrolled unless <span class="v">n</span> has already been 
resolved.</li> 
 
<li>It should typically run before sizing, since we generate unsized 
expressions.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Some implemented rewrites include:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 <li>
<span class="v">$display(...)</span> → null</li> 
 <li>pure-null if/case stmts → null</li> 
 <li>eliminate null stmts from blocks</li> 
 <li>empty blocks → null</li> 
 <li>collapse singleton blocks (i.e., <span class="v">begin stmt end --&gt; stmt)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;flatten compatible sub-blocks&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;@('@(...) null</span> → <span class="v">null</span> (top level only)</li> 
 <li>merge nested ifs (without elses)</li> 
 <li>wait statements → while loops</li> 
 <li>forever statements → while loops</li> 
 <li>unroll some repeat statements (up to a limit)</li> 
 <li>eliminate <span class="v">always null;</span>
</li> 
 <li>eliminate <span class="v">initial null;</span>
</li> 
 <li>eliminate <span class="v">for(...) null;</span>
</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>Note that we don't transform case statements into if statement here, but 
that's done in <a href="VL2014____CASEELIM.html">caseelim</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Bozo eventually we should also unroll simple while/for loops.</p>
