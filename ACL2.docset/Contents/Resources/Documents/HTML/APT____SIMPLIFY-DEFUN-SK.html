<p>Simplify the definition of a given function made with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span>.</p> 
 <h3>Introduction</h3> 
 
 <p>This macro is an interface to the <span class="tt"><a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">simplify</a></span> transformation for 
 function symbols that the user (or a tool) introduces with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> or 
 the <a href="SOFT____SOFT.html">soft::soft</a> tool, <span class="v">defun-sk2</span>.  When successful, it creates a new 
 such form by simplifying the body of the definition of such a function 
 symbol.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="APT____SIMPLIFY-DEFUN-SK-EXAMPLES.html">simplify-defun-sk-examples</a> for an introductory tutorial for 
 <span class="v">simplify-defun-sk</span>, which presents an extensive series of examples.</p> 
 
 <p>Evaluation of the form <span class="v">(<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY-DEFUN-SK.html">simplify-defun-sk</a> fn)</span> will attempt to define a 
 new function, say, <span class="v">fn$1</span>, that is logically equivalent to the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> definition of <span class="v">fn</span> but is simpler.  The new definition is also 
 made with <span class="v">defun-sk</span>.  In the rest of this documentation page, <span class="v">FN</span> will 
 denote the input function symbol and <span class="v">NEW</span> will generally denote the new 
 function symbol.</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="APT____SIMPLIFY-DEFUN.html">simplify-defun</a> for an analogous utility for simplifying 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> forms.</p> 
 
 <p>A <span class="v">simplify-defun-sk</span> call causes an error if no simplification takes 
 place or if the proof obligations fail to be met.  The implementation has been 
 carefully orchestrated so that the proof obligations will generally succeed. 
 When this is not the case, you may invoke <span class="v">show-simplify-defun-sk</span> with the 
 same arguments in order to obtain the form that failed to be admitted, so that 
 you can modify it manually.  Or equivalently, simply use keyword argument 
 <span class="v">:show-only t</span> in your <span class="v">simplify-defun-sk</span> call.</p> 
 
 <h3>General Form</h3> 
 
 <p>The following form shows all the keyword arguments in alphabetical order, 
 together with their default values (i.e., when the keyword is omitted).  No 
 argument is evaluated, except that if an argument is of the form <span class="v">(:eval
 x)</span>, then the actual argument is the result of evaluting of <span class="v">x</span>.  Note 
 that <span class="v">FN</span> should be a function symbol previously defined with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> or the <a href="SOFT____SOFT.html">soft::soft</a> tool, <span class="v">defun-sk2</span>; thus, 
 <span class="v">simplify-defun-sk</span> may be replaced by <span class="tt"><a href="APT____SIMPLIFY.html">simplify</a></span> to obtain an 
 essentially equivalent call.</p>

 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>Denotes the target function to transform.</p> 
 
 <p>Evaluation of <span class="v">(<a href="APT____SIMPLIFY-DEFUN-SK.html">simplify-defun-sk</a> FN ...)</span> assumes that the input 
 symbol, <span class="v">FN</span>, is a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode function symbol defined with 
 <span class="v">defun-sk</span> or with a macro expanding to a call of <span class="v">defun-sk</span>. 
 Successful evaluation admits a new <span class="v">defun-sk</span>, with the same formals as 
 <span class="v">FN</span>, and a theorem equating <span class="v">FN</span> with the newly-defined function 
 symbol.  Details, such as whether or not to perform guard verification, may be 
 controlled by keyword parameters as described below.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">FN</span> was defined using the <a href="SOFT____SOFT.html">soft::soft</a> tool <span class="v">defun-sk2</span>, 
 then the new function symbol is also introduced with <span class="v">defun-sk2</span>.</p>

 <p>The value of <span class="v">:assumptions</span> must be a list of terms (not necessarily 
 translated; see <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">ACL2::term</a>) that only reference variables among the 
 formal parameters of <span class="v">FN</span>.  However, <span class="v">:assumptions</span> may be <span class="v">:guard</span>, 
 which is equivalent to <span class="v">:assumptions (G)</span> where <span class="v">G</span> is the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> 
 of <span class="v">FN</span>; and for <span class="v">:assumptions (A1 ... :guard ... An)</span>, <span class="v">:guard</span> is

  NEW-BODY)</pre>

 precisely, the matrix of that quantified formula) unless keyword option 
 <span class="v">:simplify-body</span> has value <span class="v">nil</span>.  See above for how that option 
 controls simplification of the body, measure, and guard.  However, if <span class="v">FN</span> 
 was defined using the <a href="SOFT____SOFT.html">soft::soft</a> tool <span class="v">defun-sk2</span>, then the 
 definition of <span class="v">NEW</span> is also made with <span class="v">defun-sk2</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The generated theorem generally has the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> FN-becomes-NEW

 <p>where the calls of <span class="v">FN</span> and <span class="v">NEW</span> are on the formals of <span class="v">FN</span>. 
 However, if keyword argument <span class="v">:assumptions</span> specifies assumptions <span class="v">A1</span>,

  (<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> (FN ...) (NEW ...)))</pre>
