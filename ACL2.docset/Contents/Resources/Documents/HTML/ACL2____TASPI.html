<p>Texas Analysis of Symbolic Phylogenetic Information (TASPI) is 
specialized code for modeling collections of phylogenetic trees and performing 
a few manipulations such as consensus analysis.</p><p>The directory <span class="v">projects/taspi</span> contains the TASPI code.  These 
ACL2 books may be built by running, e.g., <span class="v">make taspi</span> from the <span class="v">books/</span> 
directory.  Please note: TASPI relies on a version of ACL2 that includes HONS 
for its speed and memory requirement claims.</p>
