<p>The Jubjub complete twisted Edwards elliptic curve [ZPS:5.4.9.3].</p><p>We define the Jubjub curve, 
     as a constant value of the fixtype <span class="tt"><a href="ECURVE____TWISTED-EDWARDS-CURVE.html">ecurve::twisted-edwards-curve</a></span> 
     of twisted Edwards elliptic curves. 
     We show that the curve is complete.</p><p>The prime and coefficient of Jubjub are formalized as nullary functions. 
     We keep disabled also their executable counterparts because 
     we generally want to treat them as algebraic quantities in proofs; 
     in particular, we want to avoid their combination into new constants 
     by the prime field normalizing rules.</p><p>We also define various notions related to Jubjub, 
     such as recognizers of points in the curve's group and subgroup.</p>
