<p>The Time Taken to do the Associativity of App Proof</p><p>The time it took us to explain this proof may leave the impression 
 that the proof is complicated.  In a way, it is.  But it happens quickly.</p> 
 
 <p>The time taken to do this proof is about 1/10 second.  The rest of the time 
 (about 2/10 seconds) is spent in pre- and post-processing.</p> 
 
 <p>Basically, this proof flashes across your screen before you can read it; 
 you see the <b>Q.E.D.</b> and don't bother to scroll back to read it.  You 
 have more important things to do than read successful proofs.</p>
