<p>Discussion of CNF generation for aignets.</p> 
<p>Generating CNF from a circuit representation is pretty simple to write, but 
the correctness conditions are tricky to state.</p> 
 
<p>Basically, we want to show that a SAT proof corresponds to a proof about the 
AIG, and a SAT counterexample corresponds to a counterexample in the AIG.</p> 
 
<p>Taking the proof case first.  We want to show that if the CNF is 
unsatisfiable, then -- what?  Well, the CNF we produce from just the circuit 
will always be satisfiable: in fact, this is the first thing we'll prove -- 
 
<blockquote>Every assignment of values to the CIs of the AIG can be translated 
to a satisfying assignment of the generated CNF by setting, for every circuit 
node that is assigned a SAT variable, the evaluation of the node to be the 
value of the variable.</blockquote> 
 
It's when we add additional constraints to the CNF that it may become 
unsatisfiable.  So suppose we want to show that some cube among the nodes of 
the circuit is unsat -- say, <span class="v">A &amp; B &amp; ~C</span>.  We first convert their 
subcircuits to CNF and then add the three singleton clauses.  Now, suppose that 
we have some assignment to the CIs that satisfies <span class="v">A &amp; B &amp; ~C</span>.  That 
induces a satisfying assignment for the generated part of the CNF where (in 
particular) the literals corresponding to A, B, and ~C are assigned true.  That 
makes the three singleton clauses also true, so the whole CNF is satisfied. 
Therefore, if we prove the CNF unsatisfiable, then we've proven that no 
assignment to the CIs can simultaneously satisfy <span class="v">A &amp; B &amp; ~C</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Now the counterexample case.  We want to show that any satisfying assignment 
of the CNF is a satisfying assignment for whatever circuit constraints we've 
added to it.  Basically, this amounts to: 
 
<blockquote>Every satisfying assignment to the generated CNF induces an 
assignment to the CIs of the circuit, under which, for every circuit node 
assigned a SAT variable, the value of the SAT literal is the same as the 
evaluation of the circuit node.</blockquote> 
 
Of course, this theorem is less critical to correctness -- if we get a SAT 
counterexample, it can easily be verified on the circuit.  Still, we'd like to 
prove it to show that our CNF generation is correct.</p> 
 
<p>To summarize, we need to show:<br> 
<blockquote>An evaluation of the circuit induces a satisfying assignment, and a 
satisfying assignment induces an evaluation of the circuit, in which the 
evaluations of circuit nodes that are assigned SAT literals is the same as the 
values of those literals under the satisfying assignment.</blockquote></p> 
 
<p>To formalize this, we'll define: 
<ul> 
<li>a predicate <span class="v">aignet-vals-agree-with-cnf</span> which compares a satisfying 
assignment to an aignet evaluation to determine whether all values agree as 
specified above,</li> 
<li>a function <span class="v">cnf-&gt;aignet-vals</span> that transforms a satisfying assignment into 
a vals object.  We'll show that the input and output satisfy 
<span class="tt">cnf/aignet-evals-agree</span> if the assignment satisfies the generated 
CNF.</li> 
<li>a function <span class="v">aignet-&gt;cnf-vals</span> that creates a CNF variable assignment from a 
vals object.  We'll show that this satisfies 
<span class="tt">cnf/aignet-evals-agree</span> and that the CNF assignment 
satisfies the generated CNF.</li> 
</ul></p> 
 
<p>When actually converting an aignet to CNF, we of course process the AIG 
recursively.  We do this in chunks, where each chunk is either: 
<ul> 
<li>a <i>supergate</i>, representing a single large AND or OR gate, or</li> 
<li>a mux.</li> 
</ul> 
For both of these cases, we prove that the chunk we've just added preserves the 
correctness criterion we've described.</p>
