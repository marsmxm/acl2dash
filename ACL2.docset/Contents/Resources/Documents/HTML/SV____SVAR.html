<p>A single variable in a symbolic vector expression.</p><p>This is a product type, introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">defflexsum</a> in support of <a href="SV____SVAR.html">svar</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name</dt> 
<dd>The name of this variable.  This can be any ACL2 object at all, 
                but our representation is optimized for <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a> or <a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> names.</dd> 
 
<dt>delay  <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>A natural valued index for this variable, used for instance 
                 to support the encoding of, e.g., previous versus current 
                 register values in FSMs.  The default delay (which enjoys an 
                 optimized representation) is 0.  See below for some motivation 
                 and explanation.</dd> 
 
<dt>nonblocking  <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>A flag used in statement processing to indicate a reference 
                     to a variable after nonblocking assignments have been done. 
                      Not used in other contexts.</dd> 
 
<dt>override-test  <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>override-val  <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
 
</dl><p>Each variable in an <a href="SV____SVEX.html">svex</a> represents a <a href="SV____4VEC.html">4vec</a>.</p> 
 
<p>In most s-expression formats, e.g., s-expressions in Lisp or in the <a href="ACL2____4V-SEXPRS.html">ACL2::4v-sexprs</a> used in <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a>, a variable is just a symbol, which 
is generally treated as if it were an atomic <b>name</b> with no further 
structure.</p> 
 
<p>In contrast, in <a href="ACL2____SV.html">sv</a>, our variables have both a name and also a natural 
numbered index (called <span class="v">delay</span>).  This index is mainly an implementation 
detail that allows us to cheaply (i.e., without <a href="ACL2____INTERN_42.html">intern$</a>) construct new 
variables.</p> 
 
<p>In the semantics of expressions, e.g., in <a href="SV____SVEX-LOOKUP.html">svex-lookup</a>, variables are 
distinct whenever they differ by name <b>or</b> by delay.  That is, as far as 
expression evaluation is concerned, the variable named "v" with delay 5 is 
completely distinct from "v" with delay 4.  Think of them as you would 
indexed variables like v_5 versus v_4 in some mathematics.</p>
