<p><span class="v">`ifdef</span> stack frame objects.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>initially-activep — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>some-thing-satisfiedp — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>already-saw-elsep — <a href="ACL2____BOOLEANP.html">booleanp</a>
</dt> 
 
<dt>mi-controller — <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>When set, this iframe is possibly an include guard 
                           and this is the name of the controlling define. 
                           See <a href="VL____VL-INCLUDESKIPS.html">vl-includeskips</a>.</dd> 
 
<dt>mi-filename — <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>Corresponds to mi-controller; the filename that is 
                           being included.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>Iframes ("ifdef frames") are essential in our approach to 
handling <span class="v">`ifdef</span> directives.  Our main preprocessing function, <a href="VL____VL-PREPROCESS-LOOP.html">vl-preprocess-loop</a>, takes three arguments that have to do with handling 
ifdefs:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">defines</span> is the current <a href="VL____VL-DEFINES-P.html">vl-defines-p</a> alist.  For now, just 
assume that we are able to appropriately keep this list updated as we encounter 
defines and undefs.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">activep</span> is a boolean which is true whenever the characters are are now 
reading from the file ought to be given to the lexer -- the idea is that when 
we encounter an <span class="v">`ifdef</span> whose condition isn't satisfied, we turn off 
<span class="v">activep</span> until the closing <span class="v">`endif</span> is encountered.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">istack</span> is a stack of <span class="v">vl-iframe-p</span> objects which explain how to 
manage <span class="v">activep</span> as we descend through a nest of <span class="v">`ifdef</span>, <span class="v">`ifndef</span>, 
<span class="v">`elsif</span>, <span class="v">`else</span>, and <span class="v">`endif</span> directives.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Let us temporarily ignore nested directives.  Then, our task would be to 
decide when activep should be turned on during sequences like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">`if[n]def THING
  stuff1
`elsif THING2
  stuff2
`elsif THING3
  stuff3
`else
  stuff4
`endif</pre> 
 
<p>The semantics of this (Section 19.4) are essentially: figure out the first 
<i>THING</i> that is satisfied, include its stuff, and ignore the rest.  So for 
instance, if <i>THING2</i> and <i>THING3</i> are both satisfied, we still only 
want to include <i>stuff2</i> since it comes first.</p> 
 
<p>To implement this, the basic idea is that when we encounter an <span class="v">`ifdef</span> 
or <span class="v">`ifndef</span> directive, we construct an iframe that helps us set 
<span class="v">activep</span> correctly.  The first two fields of the iframe are:</p> 
 
<dl> 
 
<dt><span class="v">some-thing-satisfiedp</span></dt> 
 
<dd>which indicates if any of the <i>THING</i>s we have seen so far was 
satisfied, and</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">already-saw-elsep</span></dt> 
 
<dd>which indicates whether we have seen an <span class="v">`else</span> and is used only as a 
sanity check to prevent multiple <span class="v">`else</span> clauses.</dd> 
 
</dl> 
 
<p>And as we descend through the above sequences, we update the iframe and 
ensure that <span class="v">activep</span> is set exactly when the current <i>THING</i> is 
satisfied and no previous <i>THING</i> was satisfied.</p> 
 
<p>But the story is not quite complete yet, because we also have to handle 
nested ifdefs.  For example, imagine we have:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">`ifdef OUTER
  ...
  `ifdef INNER_THING1
    stuff1
  `elsif INNER2_THING2
    stuff2
  `else
    stuff3
  `endif
  ...
`endif</pre> 
 
<p>This is almost the same, except that now we only want to turn on 
<span class="v">activep</span> when <i>OUTER</i> is also satisfied.  To keep track of this, we 
add another field to our iframe objects:</p> 
 
<dl> 
 
<dt><span class="v">initially-activep</span></dt> 
 
<dd>which indicates whether <span class="v">activep</span> was set when we encountered the 
<span class="v">`ifdef</span> or <span class="v">ifndef</span> for this iframe.</dd> 
 
</dl> 
 
<p>Now, <span class="v">activep</span> should be enabled exactly when:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>(inner criteria): the current <i>THING</i> is satisfied and no previous 
<i>THING</i> was sastified, and</li> 
 
<li>(outer-criteria): <span class="v">initially-activep</span> was also set, i.e., this chunk of 
code is not being blocked by some <i>THING</i> in an outer <span class="v">ifdef</span> 
tree.</li> 
 
</ul>
