<p>Creating and loading of compiled and expansion files for <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a></p><p>An effect of <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> is to speed up the execution of the 
 functions defined in a book.  Compilation can also remove tail recursion, thus 
 avoiding stack overflows.  The presence of compiled code for the functions in 
 the book should not otherwise affect the performance of ACL2.  See <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> for a discussion; also see <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> command compiles the book that it 
 certifies.  see <a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> for how to control this behavior.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> command loads the compiled file for 
 the book.  The details of how this loading works are subtle, and do not need 
 to be understood by most users.  The ACL2 source code contains an ``Essay on 
 Hash Table Support for Compilation'' that explains such details for those 
 interested.  All that users should generally need to know about this is that 
 the compiled file is always the result of compiling a so-called ``expansion 
 file'', which contains certain additional code besides the book itself.  The 
 relevance to users of the expansion file is that it can be loaded if the 
 compiled file is missing (except when <span class="v">:load-compiled-file t</span> is specified 
 by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form), and its existence is required in order for 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> to create a book's compiled file, as described below.</p> 
 
 <p>Most users can skip the remainder of this documentation topic, which 
 addresses the uncommon activity of using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> to compile 
 books.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Include-book</span> can be made to compile a book by supplying its keyword 
 argument <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> the value <span class="v">:comp</span>.  However, a compiled 
 file can only be produced if there is already an <i>expansion file</i> that is 
 at least as recent as the book's <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a>.  Such a file, whose name 
 happens to be the result of concatenating the string <span class="v">"@expansion.lsp"</span> 
 to the book name (without the <span class="v">".lisp"</span> suffix), is created by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> when state global variable <span class="v">'save-expansion-file</span> has a 
 non-<span class="v">nil</span> value.  That will be the case if ACL2 started up when environment 
 variable <span class="v">ACL2_SAVE_EXPANSION</span> was <span class="v">t</span> (or any value that is not the 
 empty string and whose <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____STRING-UPCASE.html">string-upcase</a></span> is not <span class="v">"NIL"</span>), until the 
 time (if any) that <span class="v">'save-expansion-file</span> is assigned a different value by 
 the user.  In most respects, the <span class="v">:comp</span> setting is treated exactly the 
 same as <span class="v">:warn</span>; but after all events in the book are processed, the 
 expansion file is compiled if a compiled file was not loaded, after which the 
 resulting compiled file is loaded.</p> 
 
 <p>One can thus, for example, compile books for several different host Lisps 
 â€” useful when installing ACL2 executables at the same site that are 
 built on different host Lisps.  A convenient way to do this in an environment 
 that provides Gnu `make' is to certify the community books using the shell 
 command ``<span class="v">make regression</span>'' in the <span class="v">acl2-sources/</span> directory, after 
 setting environment variable <span class="v">ACL2_SAVE_EXPANSION</span> to <span class="v">t</span>, and then 
 moving to the <span class="v">books</span> directory and executing the appropriate `make' 
 commands to compile the books (targets <span class="v">fasl</span>, <span class="v">o</span>, and so on, according 
 to the compiled file extension for the host Lisp).</p> 
 
 <p>We conclude by saying more about the <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> argument of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  We assume that <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global 
 <span class="v">'compiler-enabled</span> has a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value; otherwise 
 <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> is always treated as <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We do not consider raw mode below (see <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a>), which presents 
 a special case: ACL2 will attempt to load the book itself whenever it would 
 otherwise load the expansion or compiled file, but cannot (either because the 
 <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> argument is <span class="v">nil</span>, or for each of the expansion 
 and compiled files, either it does not exist or it is out of date with respect 
 to the <span class="v">.cert</span> file).</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> argument is not recursive: calls of 
 <span class="v">include-book</span> that are inside the book supplied to <span class="v">include-book</span> use 
 their own <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> arguments.  However, those subsidiary 
 <span class="v">include-book</span> calls can nevertheless be sensitive to the 
 <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> arguments of enclosing <span class="v">include-book</span> calls, as 
 follows.  If <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> has value <span class="v">t</span>, then every subsidiary 
 <span class="v">include-book</span> is required to load a compiled file.  Moreover, if a book's 
 compiled file or expansion file is loaded in raw Lisp, then an attempt will be 
 made to load the compiled file or expansion file for any <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> 
 form encountered during that load.  If that attempt fails, then that load 
 immediately aborts, as does its parent load, and so on up the chain.  If, when 
 going up the chain, an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> is aborted for which keyword 
 argument <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> has value <span class="v">t</span>, then an error occurs.</p> 
 
 <p>When loading a book's compiled file or expansion file, <span class="v">FILE</span>, it is 
 possible to encounter an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form for a book that has no 
 suitable compiled file or expansion file.  In that case, the load of <span class="v">FILE</span> 
 is aborted at that point.  Similarly, the load of <span class="v">FILE</span> is aborted in the 
 case that this <span class="v">include-book</span> form has a suitable compiled file or 
 expansion file whose load is itself aborted.  Thus, whenever any 
 <span class="v">include-book</span> aborts, so do all of its parent <span class="v">include-book</span>s, up the 
 chain.  Such an abort causes an error when the <span class="v">include-book</span> form 
 specifies a <span class="v">:load-compiled-file</span> value of <span class="v">t</span>.</p>
