<p>Specific issues and questions related to the expression sizing and 
typing of expressions.</p><p>There are several ways in which the spec seems unclear or seems to 
contradict what Verilog implementations do.</p> 
 
<h2>Q1.  Does a self-determined operand affect the types of the expressions in 
which it is involved?</h2> 
 
<p>I ask this question only about the shifting operators, power operator, and 
conditional operators; the other operators that have self-determined operands 
are: concatenation and multiple-concatenation operators (which are 
unambiguously defined to be unsigned in 5.5.1), and logical/reduction 
operations which are discussed below in Q2.</p> 
 
<p>What does the spec say?  In 5.5.1, we are told The sign and size of any 
self-determined operand are determined by the operand itself and independent of 
the remainder of the expression..  From this, and from the discussion of 
what it means to be a self-determined expression in 5.4.1, I think it is clear 
that we are supposed to compute the size/type of the subexpression without 
considering the sizes and types of other operands in the containing expression. 
But what is <b>not</b> clear is: does the resulting size and type of the 
subexpression have any bearing on the width/type of the containing 
expression?</p> 
 
<p>The width question is unambiguously answered "no" in all cases by Table 
5-22.  The type question is unambiguously answered "no" by for shift 
operators in Section 5.1.12, where we are told the right operand is always 
treated as an unsigned number and has no effect on the signedness of the 
result. But the type question is not addressed in 5.1.13 for the 
conditional operator, and while there is some discussion in 5.1.5 about the 
type of a power operator when its operands are real, the section just refers us 
to 5.4.1 and 5.5.1 for the integer cases.</p> 
 
<p>Well, 5.4.1 doesn't really say anything about types, except that it contains 
Table 5-22 that says which operands are self-determined, and 5.5.1 is back 
where we started.  So the only things we have to go on for the conditional 
operator and power operator are:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<b>R1.</b> The sign and size of any self-determined operand are determined by the operand 
itself and independent of the remainder of the expression.</li> 
 
<li>
<b>R2.</b> For nonself-determined operands, the following rules apply: 
<ul> 
 <li>If any operand is real, the result is real</li> 
 <li>If any operand is unsigned, the result is unsigned, regardless of the 
     operator</li> 
 <li>If all operands are signed, the result will be signed, regardless of operator, 
     except when specified otherwise.</li> 
</ul>
</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>We have already looked at the R1---indeed, we're trying to figure out just 
what it means by independent.  So, we are left with R2, which 
almost seems to provide a clear answer.  In particular, if any 
operand really means any operand then it is clear that we should 
include the types of these self-determined operands really do affect the results.</p> 
 
<p>But there is this damn header, For nonself-determined operands, 
which suggests this maybe any operand here only refers to any 
nonself-determined operand.  And if this is the case, then we still have no 
idea what we are supposed to do with conditional and power operations, which 
have a mixture of self and nonself-determined operands.</p> 
 
<p>We conclude that the spec is ambiguous and revert to testing with other 
Verilog implementations to see what they seem to do.</p> 
 
<h4>Conditional Operator</h4> 
 
<p>Verilog-XL and NCVerilog agree that the answer for both of the following 
expressions are <span class="v">1111101</span>.  This can only happen if the branch operands are 
being sign-extended.  Hence, it seems that these implementations treat the sign 
of the condition as irrelevant to the result type.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire [6:0] y0 = 1'b0 ? 3'sb 100 : 3'sb 101;
wire [6:0] y1 = 1'sb0 ? 3'sb 100 : 3'sb 101;</pre> 
 
<h4>Power Operator</h4> 
 
<p>Unfortunately Verilog-XL does not seem to support the power operator, so we 
only are able to test with NCVerilog.  NCVerilog reports 1984 (-64) as the 
result for both of the following,</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire [10:0] p2 = (3'sb100 ** 2'b11);
wire [10:0] p3 = (3'sb100 ** 2'sb11);</pre> 
 
<p>Hence it seems that the type of the exponent is not relevant to the result 
type.  If it were, then in p2 we would have to zero-extend the base to 4, 
rather than sign-extend it to -4, and the result for p2 would be 64 instead of 
1984.</p> 
 
<h4>Shift Operators</h4> 
 
<p>For good measure we also tried a shift-operator, even though we think the 
spec is clear here.</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire [4:0] v1 = 1'sd 1 &gt;&gt; 1'b0;</pre> 
 
<p>Here, ignoring the sign of the right-hand side would produce <span class="v">11111</span>, 
since the left-hand side would be sign-extended to 5 bits and then unchanged by 
the shift.  On the other hand, if we allow the right-hand side to play a role, 
then the result is unsigned and we would zero-extend the left-hand side 
instead, producing a final result of 1.  Both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog get 
<span class="v">11111</span>, which we think is correct.</p> 
 
<h4>Conclusions</h4> 
 
<p>The implementations seem to agree that the types of these operands should 
not matter.  Since we think the spec is vague and does not say one way or 
another, we mimick their behavior.  However, we also issue warnings when we 
encounter one of these operands with an unsigned self-determined operand and 
signed nonself-determined operands, since this is a case that other 
implementations might be confused about.  See <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-TYPEDECIDE-AUX.html">vl-expr-typedecide-aux</a> for 
details.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Q2.  What is the type of a reduction or logical operation?</h3> 
 
<p>The ambiguity in Q1 is also a problem for:</p> 
<ul> 
 
<li>the logical operators (<span class="v">&amp;&amp;</span>, <span class="v">||</span>, and <span class="v">!</span>) and</li> 
 
<li>the reduction operators (<span class="v">&amp;</span>, <span class="v">~&amp;</span>, <span class="v">|</span>, <span class="v">~|</span>, <span class="v">^</span>, <span class="v">~^</span>, 
and <span class="v">^~</span>).</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>In these cases, there are no nonself-determined operators that R2 might 
allow us to use to get an answer.  5.1.11 (reduction operators) doesn't provide 
any help, and neither does 5.1.9 (logical operators).  So, we are again reduced 
to testing.  Here are some simple cases:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire [4:0] q0 = | 17;
wire [4:0] q1 = ! 3'sd 0;
wire [4:0] q2 = &amp; 5'sb11111;
wire [4:0] q3 = 3 &amp;&amp; 5;</pre> 
 
<p>In Verilog-XL and NCVerilog, all of these expressions produce <span class="v">00001</span>, 
meaning that in each case they are being zero-extended instead of sign 
extended.  This is somewhat further evidence that R2 is not supposed to apply 
to self-determined operands.</p> 
 
<p>Some internet searching revealed <a href="http://www.eda.org/svdb/bug_view_page.php?bug_id=0001072" target="_blank"><nobr>Issue 
1072<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.eda.org/svdb/bug_view_page.php?bug_id=0001072"></nobr></a> at the EDA.org "mantis" site, which seems to suggests that the spec 
is wrong and should say reduction operators and logical operators produce 
unsigned 1-bit values.</p> 
 
<p>We therefore treat these as unsigned 1-bit values, but we take special care 
to generate warnings if this treatment affects the final signedness of an 
expression.  See <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-TYPEDECIDE.html">vl-expr-typedecide</a> for details.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Q3.  What does shifting by a negative number mean?</h3> 
 
<p>This question is silly because it seems that the Verilog specification 
somewhat clearly says in 5.1.12 that the right operand is always treated as 
an unsigned number.</p> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, Verilog-XL and NCVerilog produce different results for:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">wire [9:0] v0 = 10'b 0000_11_0000 &gt;&gt; ( 2'sd 0 + 1'sd 1 );</pre> 
 
<p>In Verilog-XL, the answer is <span class="v">0001_10_0000</span>, i.e., the result appears to 
have been left-shifted by one place; in NCVerilog, the answer is 
<span class="v">0000_00_0110</span>, i.e., the result appears to have been right-shifted by 3 
places.</p> 
 
<p>In both cases, the right-hand side seems to indeed be self-determined and 
yields 2'sd 3.  And, since we are supposed to "treat the right-hand side as an 
unsigned number," it seems like we should shift the left-hand side by 3 places 
to the right like NCVerilog.</p> 
 
<p>I found some discussion from the IEEE 1364 Behavioral Task Force Mailing 
List Archives, specifically a <a href="http://www.boydtechinc.com/btf/archive/btf_1999/0642.html" target="_blank"><nobr>signed shift 
errata?<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.boydtechinc.com/btf/archive/btf_1999/0642.html"></nobr></a> thread started by Stuart Sutherland on Monday, July 19, 1999, the 
followup to which suggests that Verilog-XL is in the wrong and that this is one 
area where NCVerilog was designed to match the Verilog-2005 standard instead of 
Verilog-XL.</p> 
 
<p>We follow NCVerilog's behavior, but issue a warning if we see a signed 
right-hand side (unless it is a signed constant whose sign-bit is zero) so that 
the difference does not matter.  See <a href="VL2014____VL-EXPR-TYPEDECIDE-AUX.html">vl-expr-typedecide-aux</a> for 
details.</p>
