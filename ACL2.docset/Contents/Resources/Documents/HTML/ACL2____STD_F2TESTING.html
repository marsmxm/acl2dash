<p>A library of testing utilities.</p><p>These are utilities for creating tests. 
     This library does not contain actual tests 
     (other than perhaps tests for the testing utilities themselves), 
     which are normally next to the code that they test. 
     Note that <span class="v">[books]/system/tests/</span> contains actual tests, 
     for the ACL2 system code.</p>
