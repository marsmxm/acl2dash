<p>Functions for working with the hierarchy of dependencies between 
Verilog descriptions.</p><p>In Verilog-2005, the modules in a design form a hierarchy.  Here is 
some terminology we'll use regarding this hierarchy:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We say that superior modules <i>depend on</i> the modules they 
instantiate.</li> 
 
<li>We say that submodules are <i>necessary for</i> the modules that 
instantiate them.</li> 
 
<li>We say that modules are <i>missing</i> if they are instantiated but never 
defined.</li> 
 
<li>We say that a module list is <i>complete</i> if every module that is ever 
instantiated has a definition.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog adds many kinds of top-level descriptions besides modules. 
For instance, we may have interfaces, packages, programs, and so forth.  There 
may also be top-level declarations of parameters, functions, etc., that are not 
embedded within any containing package, module, etc.</p> 
 
<p>We can imagine a similar, expanded notion of hierarchy that can be applied 
to designs with these other kinds of descriptions.</p> 
 
<p>In the functions below, we take a rather inclusive view of the dependencies 
between design elements.  We view the design as containing a directed graph of 
dependencies:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>The nodes are any top-level design elements.  For instance, a node might be 
a top-level container such as a module, interface, or package; it also might be 
a top-level function declaration, parameter, etc.</li> 
 
<li>The edges in the graph are dependencies from one node to another.  For 
instance, we will say a superior module depends on the submodule it 
instantiates, an interface depends on any packages it imports, a parameter 
depends on the data type it refers to, and so forth.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This inclusive view makes collecting dependencies somewhat involved.  We 
have to walk through the expressions and check for references to items from 
other packages.  We also have to examine the data type of every variable.  The 
work of extracting the core dependency graph is done by the <a href="VL____IMMDEPS.html">immdeps</a> 
functions.</p> 
 
<p>Once we have collected a dependency graph, we can use it for many 
purposes.</p>
