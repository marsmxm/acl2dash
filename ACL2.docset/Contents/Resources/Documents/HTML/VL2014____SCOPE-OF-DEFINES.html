<p>How VL and other tools handle the scope of <span class="v">`defines</span>.</p><p><i>What is the scope of a <span class="v">`define</span>?</i></p> 
 
<p>Until the end of 2009, we treated <span class="v">`define</span>s as having file-scope, and 
processed every file using only the initial <span class="v">define</span>s to begin with.  But 
now we are treating <span class="v">`define</span>s as cumulative, allowing them to spill over 
from one file into the next.  This is convenient in that it allows us to see 
what defines have been encountered, and hence we can programmatically extract 
the values associated with particular <span class="v">`define</span> symbols.</p> 
 
<p>This is scary.  The order of file loading is not especially predictable when 
<a href="VL2014____VL-FLUSH-OUT-DESCRIPTIONS.html">vl-flush-out-descriptions</a> is used, so different things might happen 
depending on which files happen to get loaded first!</p> 
 
<p>Well, our behavior appears to be at least similar to what other Verilog 
tools do.  We found that, on both Verilog-XL and NCVerilog,</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">`define</span>s that occur before an <span class="v">`include</span> do seem to carry over into 
the included file.</li> 
 
<li>When we give the tool multiple files, e.g., <span class="v">verilog foo.v bar.v</span> or 
<span class="v">ncverilog foo.v bar.v</span>, the includes from the earlier files do carry over 
to the later files.  Hence, switching the argument order can affect simulation 
results.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">`define</span>s that occur in the main files (those that are given as 
explicit command line arguments) are indeed carried over into library 
files</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">`define</span>s from earlier-loaded library files are carried over into 
later-loaded library files.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Our behavior is <b>approximately</b> the same.  However, it seems very 
likely that our particular way of loading missing descriptions with <a href="VL2014____VL-FLUSH-OUT-DESCRIPTIONS.html">vl-flush-out-descriptions</a> will be at least somewhat different from how other tools 
look for missing descriptions.  Roughly, after parsing the main files, we figure out 
what descriptions are missing and try to load them in alphabetical order.  Other 
tools probably use different orders and may produce very different 
behaviors.</p> 
 
<p>BOZO we could probably defend against this by tracking which <span class="v">ifdef</span> 
tests have ever been considered and what their values are.  If we find that two 
files have ever done an <span class="v">ifdef</span> and gotten different results, we could add a 
warning that maybe something is amiss with file loading.</p>
