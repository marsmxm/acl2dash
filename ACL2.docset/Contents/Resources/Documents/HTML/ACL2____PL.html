<p>Print the rules for the given name or term</p><pre class="code">Examples:
:pl foo        ; prints rules that rewrite some call of foo
:pl quote      ; prints rules that rewrite quoted constants
:pl (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y)    ; prints rules that rewrite (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y)
:pl '(4 1 2 3) ; prints rules that rewrite '(4 1 2 3)</pre> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____PL2.html">pl2</a>, which restricts output to rules that you specify for a 
 given term.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Pl</span> takes one argument, which should be a symbol or a term.</p> 
 
 <p>First suppose that the argument is a symbol.  Then it should be the symbol 
 <span class="v">quote</span>, a function symbol, or else a macro alias for a function 
 symbol (see <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>), which is treated as the corresponding 
 function symbol.  When the argument to <span class="v">pl</span> is <span class="v">quote</span>, <span class="v">pl</span> displays 
 the rules that rewrite quoted constants, i.e., the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE-QUOTED-CONSTANT.html">rewrite-quoted-constant</a></span> rules.  Otherwise, <span class="v">:pl</span> displays rules that apply 
 to terms whose top function symbol is the one specified, specifically, rules 
 of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span>, 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ELIM.html">elim</a></span>, and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INDUCTION.html">induction</a></span>.  For each 
 class, rules are displayed in order from the most recently submitted rule to 
 the oldest, with two exceptions: <span class="v">:rewrite</span>, <span class="v">:definition</span>, and 
 <span class="v">:meta</span> rules are considered as one ``class'' for this purpose; and only 
 the current (most recent) <span class="v">:elim</span> rule is displayed.</p> 
 
 <p>Otherwise the argument should be a term.  Note that the term may have 
 user-level syntax (that is, it may be an untranslated term; see <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a>), 
 for example one that is obtained from the theorem prover's output; in 
 particular, macro calls are permitted.  When supplied a term, <span class="v">:pl</span> 
 displays rules that are (possibly) applicable to the given term, in order (as 
 above, most recent rule first) for each of these four cases: first 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE-QUOTED-CONSTANT.html">rewrite-quoted-constant</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span> rules, then <span class="v">:meta</span> rules, then <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rules, and 
 finally <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rules.  Each rule is displayed with 
 additional information, such as the hypotheses that remain after applying some 
 simple techniques to discharge them that are likely to apply in any 
 context.  (Those techniques include <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a> reasoning, <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a>, and some attempts to deal with <a href="ACL2____FREE-VARIABLES.html">free-variables</a> 
 including handling of binding hypotheses, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BIND-FREE.html">bind-free</a></span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>It is important to remember that rules displayed as ``applicable'' by 
 <span class="v">pl</span> may in fact not be used because of logical requirements, like 
 failure to relieve the hypotheses in the context in which the target occurs, 
 or because of heuristics such as those controlled by the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>A reminder of this can sometimes be seen in the output of <span class="v">pl</span>.  For 
 example, if the list of un-discharged hypotheses contains <span class="v">nil</span> then the 
 hypotheses of this instance the rule are known, by trivial means, to be 
 unsatisfiable.</p> 
 
 <p>Similarly, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE-QUOTED-CONSTANT.html">rewrite-quoted-constant</a></span> rules of form <span class="v">[2]</span> are 
 not actually applied unless a certain computation produces a quoted constant. 
 For example,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "demos/rewrite-quoted-constant-examples" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
 <p>includes a form <span class="v">[2]</span> rule, named <span class="v">form-2-rule</span>, which will rewrite 
 any quoted constant occurring a position admitting <span class="v">set-equalp</span> as a 
 congruence.  The rule will apply the function <span class="v">drop-dups-and-sort</span> to the 
 constant and replace the constant by the result â€” if the result is a 
 quoted constant.  That function coerces the constant to a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></span>, 
 drops duplicate elements, and sorts the list.  Thus, <span class="v">'(3 1 1 2 . 77)</span> in a 
 <span class="v">set-equalp</span> occurrence would be rewritten to <span class="v">'(1 2 3)</span>.  However, that 
 replacement is only made if <span class="v">(drop-dups-and-sort '(3 1 1 2 . 77))</span> is 
 rewritten to a quoted constant.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:pl '(3 1 1 2 . 77)</pre> 
 
 <p>will include an entry for <span class="v">form-2-rule</span>, but the entry reads:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">New term: (DROP-DUPS-AND-SORT '(3 1 1 2 . 77))
Hypotheses: &lt;none&gt;
Equiv: SET-EQUALP
Substitution: ((LST '(3 1 1 2 . 77)))
WARNING:  The new term above is only used if it rewrites to a quoted
constant!</pre> 
 
 <p>How might the replacement not be made?  One way is if 
 <span class="v">drop-dups-and-sort</span> and its <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a></span> are both 
 disabled and there are no <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rules about that function.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that for <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a></span> rules, only those are displayed that meet 
 two conditions: the application of the metafunction returns a term different 
 from the input term, and if there is a hypothesis metafunction then it also 
 returns a term.  (A subtlety: In the case of extended metafunctions (see <a href="ACL2____EXTENDED-METAFUNCTIONS.html">extended-metafunctions</a>), a trivial metafunction context is used for the 
 application of the metafunction.)</p> 
 
 <p>Note that some rule classes are not handled by <span class="v">:pl</span>.  In particular, if 
 you want to see all <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a></span> rules, issue the command 
 <span class="v">:print-clause-processor-rules</span>, and for trusted clause-processors, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> trusted-cl-proc-table)</span>; see <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DEFINE-TRUSTED-CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">define-trusted-clause-processor</a>.</p>
