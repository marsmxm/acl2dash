<p>Parallel programming in ACL2(p)</p><p>Here we document support for parallel programming in ACL2(p), an 
 experimental extension of ACL2; also see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>One of ACL2's strengths lies in its ability to execute industrial models 
 efficiently.  The ACL2 source code provides an experimental parallel execution 
 capability that can increase the speed of explicit evaluation, including 
 simulator runs using such models, and it can also decrease the time required 
 for proofs that make heavy use of the evaluation of ground terms.</p> 
 
 <p>The parallelism primitives are <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PLET.html">plet</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PARGS.html">pargs</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PAND.html">pand</a></span>, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POR.html">por</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SPEC-MV-LET.html">spec-mv-let</a></span>.  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PAND.html">Pand</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____POR.html">por</a></span> terminate 
 early when an argument is found to evaluate to <span class="v">nil</span> or non-<span class="v">nil</span>, 
 respectively, thus potentially improving on the efficiency of lazy evaluation. 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SPEC-MV-LET.html">Spec-mv-let</a></span> is a modification of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> that supports 
 speculative and parallel execution.</p> 
 
 <p>Of the above five parallelism primitives, all but <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SPEC-MV-LET.html">spec-mv-let</a></span> allow 
 for limiting parallel execution (spawning of so-called ``threads'') depending 
 on resource availability.  Specifically, the primitives allow specification of 
 a size condition to control the <a href="ACL2____GRANULARITY.html">granularity</a> under which threads are 
 allowed to spawn.  You can use such <a href="ACL2____GRANULARITY.html">granularity</a> declarations in 
 recursively-defined functions to implement data-dependent parallelism in their 
 execution.</p> 
 
 <p>We recommend that in order to learn to use the parallelism primitives, you 
 begin by reading examples: see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM-TUTORIAL.html">parallelism-tutorial</a>.  That section will 
 direct you to further documentation topics.</p> 
 
 <p>In addition to providing parallel programming primitives, ACL2(p) also 
 provides the ability to execute the main ACL2 proof process in parallel.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a> for further details.</p> 
 
 <p>Disclaimer.  The parallelism primitives have been designed for 
 executing purely functional code, but some ACL2 functions do interesting 
 things ``under the hood'' in order to achieve their effects.  For example, 
 <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a> primitives such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-WASH.html">hons-wash</a></span> may not have the intended 
 effect when executed under the parallelism primitives.</p>
