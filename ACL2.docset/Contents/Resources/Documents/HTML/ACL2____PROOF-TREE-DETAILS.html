<p>Proof tree details not covered elsewhere</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> for an introduction to proof trees, and for a 
 list of related topics.  Here we present some details not covered 
 elsewhere.</p> 
 
 <p>1.  When proof tree display is enabled (because the command <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOP-PROOF-TREE.html">stop-proof-tree</a></span> has not been executed, or has been superseded by a later 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____START-PROOF-TREE.html">start-proof-tree</a></span> command), then time summaries will include the 
 time for proof tree display.  This time includes the time spent computing with 
 proof trees, such as the pruning process described briefly above.  Even when 
 proof trees are not displayed, such as when their display is turned off in the 
 middle of a proof, this time will be printed if it is not 0.</p> 
 
 <p>2.  When a goal is given a <span class="v">:bye</span> in a proof (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>), it is 
 treated for the purpose of proof tree display just as though it had been 
 proved.</p> 
 
 <p>3.  Several <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global variables affect proof tree display.  <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>
 proof-tree-indent)</span> is initially the string <span class="v">"| "</span>: it is the string 
 that is laid down the appropriate number of times to effect indentation. 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> proof-tree-buffer-width)</span> is initially the value of 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FMT-SOFT-RIGHT-MARGIN.html">fmt-soft-right-margin</a> state)</span>, and is used to prevent printing of the 
 annotation ``(<a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>d ...)'' in any greater column than this value. 
 However, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> proof-tree-buffer-width nil)</span> to avoid any such 
 suppression.  Finally, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> checkpoint-processors)</span> is a list of processors 
 from the constant list <span class="v">*preprocess-clause-ledge*</span>, together with 
 <span class="v">:induct</span>.  You may remove elements of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> checkpoint-processors)</span> to 
 limit which processes are considered checkpoints, but note that this can 
 affect what is printed by gag-mode (see <a href="ACL2____SET-GAG-MODE.html">set-gag-mode</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>4.  When <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></span> is not set to <span class="v">t</span> in a proof, and the 
 prover then decides to revert to the original goal and prove it by induction, 
 the proof tree display will reflect this fact as shown here:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH (reverting)</pre> 
 
 <p>5. The usual <a href="ACL2____FAILURE.html">failure</a> message is printed as part of the prooftree 
 display when a proof has failed.</p>
