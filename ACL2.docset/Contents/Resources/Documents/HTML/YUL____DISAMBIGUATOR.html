<p>The <span class="v">Disambiguator</span> transformation.</p><p>The <span class="v">Disambiguator</span> transformation described in 
     [Solidity: Internals: The Optimizer: Yul-Based Optimizer Module: 
      Preprocessing: Disambiguator], 
     makes all the variable and function names globally unique 
     by renaming them.</p><p>Conceptually, this transformation could be split into two: 
     one that disambiguates variables, and one that disambiguates functions; 
     the two are independent, and can be applied in any order. 
     We follow this approach, 
     by formalizing the disambiguation of variables and functions separately, 
     and by defining <span class="v">Disambiguator</span> as their combination.</p><p>There are many possible ways 
     to rename variables or functions so that they are globally unique. 
     To avoid committing to a specific renaming approach, 
     we characterize these transformations relationally instead of functionally: 
     instead of defining a function 
     that turns the original code into the transformed code, 
     we define a predicate over original and transformed code 
     that holds when the two have the same structure 
     except for possibly the variable or function names.</p><p>This relational formulation of 
     the disambiguation of variables and functions 
     opens the door to defining each as the combination of 
     a renaming relation that may or may not yield globally unique names, 
     and an additional uniqueness requirement on the transformed code. 
     Thus, the <span class="v">Disambiguator</span> transformation 
     is characterized relationally as the combination of <a href="YUL____RENAMING-VARIABLES.html">variable renaming</a>, <a href="YUL____RENAMING-FUNCTIONS.html">function renaming</a>, <a href="YUL____UNIQUE-VARIABLES.html">variable uniqueness</a>, and <a href="YUL____UNIQUE-FUNCTIONS.html">function uniqueness</a>.</p>
