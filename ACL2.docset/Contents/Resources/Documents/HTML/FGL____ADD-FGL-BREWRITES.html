<p>Enable some binder rewrite rules for use in FGL</p><p>Adds the given binder rewrite rule runes to the 
<span class="v">fgl-binder-rules</span> table so that each such rule will be attempted when terms 
with its LHS's leading function symbol is encountered.  The exact form of the 
rule that is used depends on the invocation: if the name given is simply a 
symbol, then the formula of that theorem or function name is used.  If the name 
is instead a <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rune, then the corresponding lemma is used.  A 
<span class="v">:formula</span> rune (which is not a valid ACL2 rune but is a valid FGL rune) is 
treated the same as a bare symbol.</p> 
 
<p>The literal runes stored in the table are slightly different than the ones 
accepted as input: a formula rune is stored as <span class="v">(:bformula name)</span> whereas a 
rewrite rune is stored as <span class="v">(:brewrite name)</span>.</p>
