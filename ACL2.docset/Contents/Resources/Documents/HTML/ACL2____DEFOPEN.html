<p>A simple event generator that creates a theorem by finding out what a 
term simplifies to under some hyp and with some hint.</p><p>In contrast to <span class="v">misc/defopener</span> (see <a href="ACL2____DEFOPENER.html">defopener</a>), the 
reductions carried out by <span class="v">defopen</span> may be less powerful because we only do 
simplification (no clausify).  However, this seems to produce more compact 
expressions than <span class="v">defopener</span>, where the result is formed by combining 
several clauses produced from the original term.</p> 
 
<p>General form:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(defopen name term &amp;key (hyp 't)
         hint (rule-classes ':rewrite))</pre>
