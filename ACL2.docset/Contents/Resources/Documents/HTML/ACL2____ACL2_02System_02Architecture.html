 <p>The user interacts with the theorem prover by giving it definitions, 
 theorems and advice.  Most often the advice is about how to store each proved 
 theorem as a rule.  Sometimes the advice is about how to prove a specific 
 theorem.</p> 
 
 <p>The database consists of all the rules ACL2 ``knows.''  It is possible to 
 include in the database all of the rules in some certified file of other 
 events.  Such certified files are called <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a> <a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Interesting proofs are usually built on top of many books, some of which 
 are written especially for that problem domain and others of which are about 
 oft-used domains, like arithmetic or list processing.  ACL2's distribution 
 includes many books written by users.  See the ``books'' link under the
