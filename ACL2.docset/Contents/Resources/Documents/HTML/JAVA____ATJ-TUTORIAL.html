<p>ATJ tutorial.</p><p>This is the top page of the ATJ tutorial.</p><h5>Scope of the Tutorial</h5><p>This tutorial is work in progress, 
    but it may be already useful in its current incomplete form. 
    This tutorial's goal is to provide user-level information 
    on how ATJ works and how to use ATJ effectively. 
    See <a href="JAVA____ATJ.html">the ATJ manual page</a> for the ATJ reference documentation, 
    which currently contains some additional information 
    that will likely be moved to this tutorial.</p><h5>Structure of the Tutorial</h5><p>This tutorial consists of this top-level page 
    plus a number of hyperlinked pages, 
    all of which are subtopics of this top-level page, 
    listed below alphabetically for easy reference. 
    Starting from this top-level page, we provide <i>Next</i> links 
    to navigate sequentially through all the tutorial pages 
    (and we also provide <i>Previous</i> links going the opposite direction). 
    It is recommended to follow this order 
    when reading this tutorial for the first time. 
    Each page starts with a short description of the contents of the page, 
    and also says whether the page may be perhaps skipped at first reading, 
    because it contains additional information 
    that may not be necessary for a user to know in order to use ATJ. 
    However, it is recommended to read all the tutorial pages, eventually.</p><h5>Relationship with the ACL2-2018 Workshop Paper</h5><p><a href="https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/paper.cgi?ACL22018.1" target="_blank"><nobr>This ACL2-2018 Workshop paper<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~eptcs/paper.cgi?ACL22018.1"></nobr></a> provides an overview of ATJ, 
    but ATJ has been significantly extended since then. 
    Some of the contents of the paper are being copied to this tutorial, 
    and updated as appropriate; 
    it is possible that the paper will be completely subsumed by this tutorial 
    once the latter is completed.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Start:</b> <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-MOTIVATION.html">Motivation for Generating Java Code from ACL2</a></p>
