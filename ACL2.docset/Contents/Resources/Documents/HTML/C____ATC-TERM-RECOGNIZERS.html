<p>Recognizers of ACL2 terms for ATC.</p><p>The user documentation of ATC 
     defines various kinds of ACL2 terms 
     that represent various C constructs. 
     ATC checks these various kinds of terms 
     as part of translating them to C.</p><p>Here we provide utilities to recognize these terms. 
     While these utilities are not needed, and are not part of, 
     ATC's C code generation code, 
     they may be useful for external tools, 
     such as APT transformations that work in synergy with ATC.</p><p>For now we provide shallow recognizers, 
     which do not thoroughly check the terms and their subterms, 
     but that suffice to distinguish the various kinds of terms. 
     We only provide these recognizers for some kinds of terms for now.</p>
