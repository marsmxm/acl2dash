<p>Warnings about comments like <span class="v">// synopsys translate_off</span>.</p><p>Designs may occasionally contain special comments that certain 
synthesis tools not to process a particular region.</p> 
 
<p>These special comments are not part of the SystemVerilog standard and we 
regard them as bad form.  VL does not give such comments any special treatment 
and will act as though they are regular comments that have no effect on 
semantics.</p> 
 
<p>As a special measure, VL looks for suspicious comments to try to at least 
warn you about them.  It should generally be straightforward to replace these 
with appropriate <span class="v">`ifdef</span>s.</p>
