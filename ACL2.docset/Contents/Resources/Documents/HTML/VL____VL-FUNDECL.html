<p>Representation of a single Verilog function.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>name — <a href="COMMON-LISP____STRINGP.html">stringp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Name of this function, e.g., <span class="v">lower_bits</span> below.</dd> 
 
<dt>rettype — <a href="VL____VL-DATATYPE.html">vl-datatype</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Return type of the function, e.g., a function might return an 
                ordinary unsigned or signed result of some width, or might 
                return a <span class="v">real</span> value, etc.  For instance, the return type 
                of <span class="v">lower_bits</span> below is <span class="v">:vl-unsigned</span>.</dd> 
 
<dt>body — <a href="VL____VL-STMT.html">vl-stmt</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The body of the function.  We represent this as an ordinary statement, 
                but it must follow certain rules as outlined in 10.4.4, e.g., 
                it cannot have any time controls, cannot enable tasks, cannot 
                have non-blocking assignments, etc.</dd> 
 
<dt>loc — <a href="VL____VL-LOCATION.html">vl-location</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Where this declaration was found in the source code.</dd> 
 
<dt>portdecls — <a href="VL____VL-PORTDECLLIST.html">vl-portdecllist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The arguments to the function, e.g., <span class="v">input [7:0] a</span> below. 
                Functions must have at least one input.  We check this in our 
                parser, but we don't syntactically enforce this requirement in 
                the <span class="v">vl-fundecl-p</span> structure.  In Verilog-2005, functions 
                may only have inputs (i.e., they can't have outputs or inouts), 
                but our <a href="VL____VL-PORTDECL-P.html">vl-portdecl-p</a> structures have a direction, so in 
                the context of a function declaration this direction should 
                always be <span class="v">:vl-input</span>.  In SystemVerilog functions can have 
                other kinds of ports, but functions with output/inout ports 
                have restrictions and can't be used in expressions like normal 
                functions.</dd> 
 
<dt>function — <a href="SV____MAYBE-SVEX.html">sv::maybe-svex</a>
</dt> 
<dd>The svex expression for the value of the function, if it has been 
                computed, which happens during elaboration</dd> 
 
<dt>constraints — <a href="SV____CONSTRAINTLIST.html">sv::constraintlist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Constraints that must hold of the function inputs, or the result 
                 may be undefined; computed during elaboration</dd> 
 
<dt>lifetime — <a href="VL____VL-LIFETIME-P.html">vl-lifetime-p</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Indicates whether an explicit <span class="v">automatic</span> or <span class="v">static</span> 
                lifetime was provided.  An automatic function is supposed to be 
                reentrant and have its local parameters dynamically allocated 
                for each function call, with various consequences.</dd> 
 
<dt>vardecls — <a href="VL____VL-VARDECLLIST.html">vl-vardecllist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Local variable declarations, including ones for the ports and 
                 return value (see below).</dd> 
 
<dt>paramdecls — <a href="VL____VL-PARAMDECLLIST.html">vl-paramdecllist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Local parameter declarations</dd> 
 
<dt>typedefs — <a href="VL____VL-TYPEDEFLIST.html">vl-typedeflist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Local type declarations.</dd> 
 
<dt>imports — <a href="VL____VL-IMPORTLIST.html">vl-importlist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Local package imports</dd> 
 
<dt>atts — <a href="VL____VL-ATTS.html">vl-atts</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Any attributes associated with this function declaration.</dd> 
 
<dt>loaditems — <a href="VL____VL-PORTDECL-OR-BLOCKITEM-LIST.html">vl-portdecl-or-blockitem-list</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Owned by <a href="VL____SHADOWCHECK.html">shadowcheck</a>; do not use elsewhere. 
                 Declarations within the function, in parse order, before 
                 sorting out into imports, vardecls, paramdecls, and 
                 typedefs.</dd> 
 
</dl><p>Functions are described in Section 10.4 of the Verilog-2005 
standard.  An example of a function is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">function [3:0] lower_bits;
  input [7:0] a;
  reg [1:0] lowest_pair;
  reg [1:0] next_lowest_pair;
  begin
    lowest_pair = a[1:0];
    next_lowest_pair = a[3:2];
    lower_bits = {next_lowest_pair, lowest_pair};
  end
endfunction</pre> 
 
<p>Note that functions don't have any inout or output ports.  Instead, you 
assign to a function's name to indicate its return value.</p> 
 
<p>To simplify scoping issues, we put "hidden" variables declarations for the 
ports and return value of the function into its <span class="v">decls</span>.  These ports are 
marked with the <span class="v">VL_HIDDEN_DECL_FOR_TASKPORT</span> attribute.  The pretty printer 
and other code rely on this attribute to produce the correct output.  These 
extra declarations are created automatically by the loader.</p>
