<p>The Instantiation of the Induction Scheme</p><p>The induction scheme just shown is just an abbreviation for our 
 real goal.</p> 
 
 <p>To obtain our actual goals we have to replace the schema <span class="v">:P</span> by the 
 associativity conjecture (instantiated as shown in the scheme).</p> 
 
 <p>This produces two actual goals, the induction step and the base case.</p>
