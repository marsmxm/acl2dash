<p>Proof tree example</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____PROOF-TREE.html">proof-tree</a> for an introduction to proof trees, and for a 
 list of related topics.  Here we present a detailed example followed by a 
 shorter example that illustrates proof by induction.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> proof for the definition of a function 
 <span class="v">cancel_equal_plus</span>; the body of this definition is of no importance here. 
 The first proof tree display is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
     |  &lt;18 subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>This is to be read as follows.</p> 
 
 <blockquote><p>At this stage of the proof we have encountered the top-level 
  goal, named "Goal", which generated 18 subgoals using the ``preprocess'' 
  process.  We have not yet begun to work on those subgoals.</p></blockquote> 
 
 <p>The corresponding message from the ordinary prover output is:</p> 
 
 <blockquote><p>By case analysis we reduce the conjecture to the following 18 
  conjectures.</p></blockquote> 
 
 <p>Note that the field just before the name of the goal (<span class="v">"Goal"</span>), which 
 here contains the number 18, indicates the number of cases (children) created 
 by the goal using the indicated process.  This number will remain unchanged as 
 long as this goal is displayed.</p> 
 
 <p>The next proof tree display is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
   1 |  Subgoal 18 simp
     |  |  &lt;1 subgoal&gt;
     |  &lt;17 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>which indicates that at this point, the prover has used the simplification 
 (``simp'') process on Subgoal 18 to create one subgoal (``&lt;1 
 subgoal&gt;'').  The vertical bar (``|'') below ``Subgoal 18'', accompanied by 
 the line below it, signifies that there are 17 siblings of Subgoal 18 that 
 remain to be processed.</p> 
 
 <p>The next proof tree displayed is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
   1 |  Subgoal 18 simp
c  2 |  |  Subgoal 18' ELIM
     |  |  |  &lt;2 subgoals&gt;
     |  &lt;17 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Let us focus on the fourth line of this display:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">c  2 |  |  Subgoal 18' ELIM</pre> 
 
 <p>The ``c'' field marks this goal as a ``checkpoint'', i.e., a goal worthy of 
 careful scrutiny.  In fact, any goal that creates children by a process other 
 than ``preprocess'' or ``simp'' is marked as a checkpoint.  In this case, the 
 destructor-elimination (``<a href="ACL2____ELIM.html">elim</a>'') process has been used to create 
 subgoals of this goal.  The indentation shows that this goal, Subgoal 18', is 
 a child of Subgoal 18.  The number ``2'' indicates that 2 subgoals have been 
 created (by <a href="ACL2____ELIM.html">elim</a>).  Note that this information is consistent with the 
 line just below it, which says ``&lt;2 subgoals&gt;''.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, the last line of this proof tree display,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">|  &lt;17 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>is connected by vertical bars (``|'') up to the string <span class="v">"Subgoal 18"</span>, 
 which suggests that there are 17 immediate subgoals of Goal remaining to 
 process after Subgoal 18.  Note that this line is indented one level from the 
 second line, which is the line for the goal named <span class="v">"Goal"</span>.  The display 
 is intended to suggest that the subgoals of Goal that remain to be proved 
 consist of Subgoal 18 together with 17 more subgoals.</p> 
 
 <p>The next proof tree display differs from the previous one only in that now, 
 Subgoal 18' has only one more subgoal to be processed.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
   1 |  Subgoal 18 simp
c  2 |  |  Subgoal 18' ELIM
     |  |  |  &lt;1 more subgoal&gt;
     |  &lt;17 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that the word ``more'' in ``&lt;1 more subgoal&gt;'' tells us that 
 there was originally more than one subgoal of Subgoal 18.  In fact that 
 information already follows from the line above, which (as previously 
 explained) says that Subgoal 18' originally created 2 subgoals.</p> 
 
 <p>The next proof tree display occurs when the prover completes the proof of 
 that ``1 more subgoal'' referred to above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
     |  &lt;17 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Then, Subgoal 17 is processed and creates one subgoal, by 
 simplification:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
   1 |  Subgoal 17 simp
     |  |  &lt;1 subgoal&gt;
     |  &lt;16 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>... and so on.</p> 
 
 <p>Later in the proof one might find the following successive proof tree 
 displays.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
     |  &lt;9 more subgoals&gt;

( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)

  18 Goal preprocess
   0 |  Subgoal 9 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a>)
     |  &lt;8 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>These displays tell us that Subgoal 9 simplified to <span class="v">t</span> (note that the 
 ``0'' shows clearly that no subgoals were created), but that some rule's 
 hypotheses were <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>d.  Although this goal is not checkpointed (i.e., 
 no ``c'' appears on the left margin), one can cause such goals to be 
 checkpointed; see <a href="ACL2____CHECKPOINT-FORCED-GOALS.html">checkpoint-forced-goals</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>In fact, the proof tree displayed at the end of the ``main proof''(the 0-th 
 forcing round) is as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
   0 |  Subgoal 9 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a>)
   0 |  Subgoal 8 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a>)
   0 |  Subgoal 7 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a>)
   0 |  Subgoal 6 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a>)
   0 |  Subgoal 4 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a>)
   0 |  Subgoal 3 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>This is followed by the following proof tree display at the start of the 
 forcing round.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">  18 Goal preprocess
   0 |  Subgoal 9 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 4)
   0 |  Subgoal 8 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 6)
   0 |  Subgoal 7 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 1)
   0 |  Subgoal 6 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 3)
   0 |  Subgoal 4 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 5)
   0 |  Subgoal 3 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 2)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   6 [1]Goal FORCING-ROUND
   2 |  [1]Subgoal 6 preprocess
     |  |  &lt;2 subgoals&gt;
     |  &lt;5 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>This display shows which goals to ``blame'' for the existence of each goal 
 in the forcing round.  For example, Subgoal 9 is to blame for the creation of 
 [1]Subgoal 4.</p> 
 
 <p>Actually, there is no real goal named <span class="v">"[1]Goal"</span>.  However, the 
 line</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">6 [1]Goal FORCING-ROUND</pre> 
 
 <p>appears in the proof tree display to suggest a ``parent'' of the six 
 top-level goals in that forcing round.  As usual, the numeric field before the 
 goal name contains the original number of children of that (virtual, in this 
 case) goal â€” in this case, 6.</p> 
 
 <p>In our example proof, Subgoal 6 eventually gets proved, without doing any 
 further forcing.  At that point, the proof tree display looks as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
   0 |  Subgoal 9 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 4)
   0 |  Subgoal 7 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 1)
   0 |  Subgoal 6 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 3)
   0 |  Subgoal 4 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 5)
   0 |  Subgoal 3 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 2)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   6 [1]Goal FORCING-ROUND
     |  &lt;5 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>Notice that the line for Subgoal 8,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">0 |  Subgoal 8 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 6)</pre> 
 
 <p>no longer appears.  That is because the goal [1]Subgoal 6 has been proved, 
 along with all its children; and hence, the proof of Subgoal 8 no longer 
 depends on any further reasoning.</p> 
 
 <p>The final two proof tree displays in our example are as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
  18 Goal preprocess
   0 |  Subgoal 7 simp (<a href="ACL2____FORCED.html">FORCED</a> [1]Subgoal 1)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
   6 [1]Goal FORCING-ROUND
   2 |  [1]Subgoal 1 preprocess
   1 |  |  [1]Subgoal 1.1 preprocess
   1 |  |  |  [1]Subgoal 1.1' simp
c  3 |  |  |  |  [1]Subgoal 1.1'' ELIM
     |  |  |  |  |  &lt;1 more subgoal&gt;

( DEFUN CANCEL_EQUAL_PLUS ...)
&lt;&lt;PROOF TREE IS EMPTY&gt;&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>The explanation for the empty proof tree is simple: once [1]Subgoal 1.1.1 
 was proved, nothing further remained to be proved.  In fact, the much 
 sought-after ``Q.E.D.'' appeared shortly after the final proof tree was 
 displayed.</p> 
 
 <p>Let us conclude with a final, brief example that illustrates proof by 
 induction.  Partway through the proof one might come across the following 
 proof tree display.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)
   1 Goal preprocess
   2 |  Goal' simp
c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1
     |  |  &lt;1 more subgoal&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>This display says that in the attempt to prove a theorem called 
 <span class="v">plus-tree-del</span>, preprocessing created the only child Goal' from Goal, and 
 Goal' simplified to two subgoals.  Subgoal 2 is immediately pushed for proof 
 by induction, under the name ``*1''.  In fact if Subgoal 1 simplifies to 
 <span class="v">t</span>, then we see the following successive proof tree displays after the one 
 shown above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)
   1 Goal preprocess
   2 |  Goal' simp
c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1

( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)
   1 Goal preprocess
   2 |  Goal' simp
c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
c  6 *1 INDUCT
     |  &lt;5 more subgoals&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>The separator ``+++++...'' says that we are beginning another trip through 
 the waterfall.  In fact this trip is for a proof by induction (as opposed to a 
 forcing round), as indicated by the word ``INDUCT''.  Apparently *1.6 was 
 proved immediately, because it was not even displayed; a goal is only 
 displayed when there is some work left to do either on it or on some goal that 
 it brought (perhaps indirectly) into existence.</p> 
 
 <p>Once a proof by induction is completed, the ``PUSH'' line that refers to 
 that proof is eliminated (``pruned'').  So for example, when the present proof 
 by induction is completed, the line</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">c  0 |  |  Subgoal 2 PUSH *1</pre> 
 
 <p>is eliminated, which in fact causes the lines above it to be eliminated 
 (since they no longer refer to unproved children).  Hence, at that point one 
 might expect to see:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">( DEFTHM PLUS-TREE-DEL ...)
&lt;&lt;PROOF TREE IS EMPTY&gt;&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>However, if the proof by induction of *1 necessitates further proofs by 
 induction or a forcing round, then this ``pruning'' will not yet be 
 done.</p>
