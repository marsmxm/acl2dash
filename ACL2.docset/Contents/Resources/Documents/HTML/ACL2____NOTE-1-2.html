<p>Acl2 Version 1.2 Notes</p><p>Hacker mode has been eliminated and <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING.html">programming</a> mode has 
 been added.  <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING.html">Programming</a> mode is unsound but does syntax checking and 
 permits redefinitions of names.  See <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> <span class="v">load-mode</span> and 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> <span class="v">g-mode</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The arguments to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> have changed.  <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">Ld</a></span> is now much more 
 sophisticated.  See <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>For those occasions on which you wish to look at a large list structure 
 that you are afraid to print, try <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WALKABOUT.html">walkabout</a> x state)</span>, where <span class="v">x</span> is an 
 Acl2 expression that evaluates to the structure in question.  I am afraid 
 there is no <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> yet, but it is similar in spirit to the 
 Interlisp structure editor.  You are standing on an object and commands move 
 you around in it.  E.g., 1 moves you to its first element, 2 to its second, 
 etc.; 0 moves you up to its parent; <span class="v">nx</span> and <span class="v">bk</span> move you to its next 
 sibling and previous sibling; <span class="v">pp</span> prettyprints it; <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____Q.html">q</a></span> exits 
 returning <span class="v">nil</span>; <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a></span> exits returning the thing you're standing on; 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a> symb)</span> assigns the thing you're standing on to the <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global 
 variable <span class="v">symb</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Several new <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> have been implemented, including <span class="v">:by</span> and 
 <span class="v">:do-not</span>.  The old <span class="v">:do-not-generalize</span> has been scrapped in favor of 
 such new <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> as <span class="v">:do-not</span> <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____GENERALIZE.html">generalize</a> elim)</span>.  <span class="v">:By</span> lets 
 you say ``this goal is subsumed by'' a given lemma instance.  The <span class="v">:by</span> 
 hint also lets you say ``this goal can't be proved yet but skip it and see how 
 the rest of the proof goes.'' See <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.</p>
