<p>Shallow embedding of C in ACL2 for ATC.</p><p>The ACL2 representation of C constructs, 
     which ATC recognizes and translates to C, 
     constitutes a shallow embedding of C in ACL2. 
     In contrast, the <a href="C____ATC-ABSTRACT-SYNTAX.html">abstract syntax</a>, <a href="C____ATC-STATIC-SEMANTICS.html">static semantics</a>, and <a href="C____ATC-DYNAMIC-SEMANTICS.html">dynamic semantics</a> constitute a deep embedding of C in ACL2. 
     The two are not separate: 
     the deep embedding, specifically the dynamic semantics, 
     includes the shallow embedding.</p><p>The file where this XDOC topic appears 
     can be included by tools, such as APT transformations, 
     that need to operate on the ACL2 representations of the C constructs, 
     without having to include all of ATC.</p>
