<p>Internal representations of symbolic bit vectors.</p><p>GL's core symbolic arithmetic functions operate on lists of <a href="GL____BFR.html">bfr</a>s, which may be interpreted either as signed or unsigned symbolic 
integers.</p> 
 
<p>For unsigned bit vectors this is entirely straightforward.  We use an 
LSB-first encoding of the bits, so the <a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> of a BFR list represents the 
least significant bit of the natural number, a la <a href="ACL2____LOGCAR.html">logcar</a>, whereas the 
<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> of the BFR represents its more significant bits, a la <a href="ACL2____LOGCDR.html">logcdr</a>.</p> 
 
<p>For signed bit vectors, we use a similar encoding except that we interpret 
the final bit of the number as the sign bit.  So, when working on a signed bit 
vector, we generally use <a href="GL____SCDR.html">scdr</a> instead of just <a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a>.</p>
