<p>Prove that <a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-FIX.html">pseudo-term-fix</a> is transparent to an evaluator and 
          that the evaluator thus has a <span class="v">pseudo-term-equiv</span> congruence on its 
          first argument.</p><p>See also <a href="ACL2____DEF-EV-PSEUDO-TERM-FTY-SUPPORT.html">def-ev-pseudo-term-fty-support</a>, which you may which 
to use instead since this macro only provides a subset of the theorems 
introduced by it.</p>
