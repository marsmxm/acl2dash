<p>ACL2 Version  6.5 (August, 2014) Notes</p><p>NOTE!  New users can ignore these release notes, because the <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a> has been updated to reflect all changes that are recorded 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>Below we roughly organize the changes to ACL2 since Version 6.4 into the 
 following categories of changes: existing features, new features, heuristic 
 improvements, bug fixes, changes at the system level, Emacs support, and 
 experimental versions.  Each change is described in just one category, though 
 of course many changes could be placed in more than one category.</p> 
 
 <p>See also <a href="ACL2____NOTE-6-5-BOOKS.html">note-6-5-books</a> for a summary of changes made to the ACL2 
 Community Books since ACL2 6.4, including the build system.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes to Existing Features</h3> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR_04.html">brr@</a></span> command now supports inputs <span class="v">:initial-ttree</span> and 
 <span class="v">:final-ttree</span>.  Thanks to David Rager for a request leading to these 
 enhancements.  See <a href="ACL2____TTREE.html">ttree</a> for a discussion of the tag-tree structures 
 returned for these inputs.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) A restriction for structure-sharing (as described in a remark, 
 ``Remark on print-circle-files''; see <a href="ACL2____PRINT-CONTROL.html">print-control</a>) involving GCL has 
 been removed, since this is no longer required for the latest GCL 
 versions (2.6.8 and 2.6.10).  Thanks to Jared Davis and Camm Maguire for 
 useful discussions and this GCL improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>The keyword commands <span class="v">:exit</span> and <span class="v">:quit</span> are disabled inside <a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a>, in order to avoid accidental exits from ACL2.  Thanks to David Rager for 
 suggesting such a change.</p> 
 
 <p>For calls of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> made during the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> phase 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, keyword <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> no longer causes 
 evaluation of the first argument of <span class="v">make-event</span>; rather, the value of 
 <span class="v">:check-expansion</span> is simply used as the expansion.  Thanks to Sol Swords 
 for suggesting this change, which made it reasonable to ignore such 
 <span class="v">make-event</span> forms when determining the ``rolling back'' before that 
 <span class="v">include-book</span> phase, as described in the next section.</p> 
 
 <p>The form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____RESET-PREHISTORY.html">reset-prehistory</a> nil)</span> now is a no-op if <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global 
 <span class="tt">'</span><span class="v">skip-reset-prehistory</span> has a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value.  Thanks to Sol 
 Swords for requesting this feature (in support of infrastructure for 
 certifying the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>The output from <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR_12.html">pr!</a></span>, <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span>, and 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SHOW-BODIES.html">show-bodies</a></span> has been tweaked.  Thanks to a suggestion from Ben 
 Selfridge, such output now shows the hypotheses (the <span class="v">Hyps</span> field) above 
 the left-hand side and right-hand side of a <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule (<span class="v">Lhs</span> and 
 <span class="v">Rhs</span>, respectively).  The <span class="v">Equiv</span> field has also been moved up before 
 the <span class="v">Lhs</span> field in such output for rewrite rules, and this field has been 
 added for <a href="ACL2____ELIM.html">elim</a> rules.  Finally, the <span class="v">Hyps</span> field now appears above 
 the <span class="v">Term</span> field in such output for <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a> rules.</p> 
 
 <p>Rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> may now be <a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a>ed.  Thanks to 
 David Rager for requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>When forcing (see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span>) is applied, we now always see the 
 appropriate <a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>, <span class="v">(:executable-counterpart force)</span>, in 
 the proof output and summary; this hadn't previously been the case.  Thanks to 
 Robert Krug for bringing this issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>The default value for the <span class="v">:write-port</span> keyword argument of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> is now <span class="v">t</span>, as was already claimed by the documentation. 
 Thus, a <span class="v">.port</span> file will be written when a book is certified, making it 
 more likely that a subsequent <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> will complete without error 
 even if the book has been modified without recertification.  Note that a 
 change by Sol Swords to the build system for the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> now 
 sets an environment variable to guarantee that <span class="v">write-port</span> is true, 
 independent of this change.  On a related note: the unadvertised environment 
 variable <span class="v">ACL2_WRITE_PORT</span> is now handled more appropriately, by interning 
 its upcased argument into the ACL2 package.</p> 
 
 <p>The following changes can make it easier to include books that are 
 uncertified or have corrupted compiled files.  Thanks to Sol Swords for 
 sending helpful, relevant examples and for subsequent discussions helping to 
 lead to these changes.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>It is no longer illegal to call <span class="v">set-compiler-enabled</span> within <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.  See <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a>, which shows how to do this in order to avoid 
 loading the compiled file not only for a book specified by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> but also for all books included under that book.  Also see <a href="ACL2____COMPILATION.html">compilation</a> for an analogous utility, <span class="v">(set-port-file-enabled nil state)</span>, 
 to avoid loading <span class="v">.port</span> files.  (For background on <span class="v">.port</span> files, see 
 <a href="ACL2____UNCERTIFIED-BOOKS.html">uncertified-books</a>).</li> 
 
 <li>In situations where it is legal to include an uncertified book (typically, 
 any time other than during <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, ACL2 nonetheless could fail 
 to do so when an error occurred while reading a <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> file.  ACL2 
 can now instead include the book successfully as an uncertified book.</li> 
 
 <li>When hard raw Lisp errors occur during loading of compiled files on behalf 
 of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event, that event can now complete successfully 
 much as though the compiled file were simply missing.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>(SBCL only) The function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SETENV_42.html">setenv$</a></span> is now supported in SBCL, which 
 had been the one supported host Lisp for which <span class="v">setenv$</span> had not been 
 supported.  Thanks to Jared Davis for pointing the way to this 
 improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>Built-in <a href="ACL2____EQUALITY-VARIANTS.html">equality-variants</a> have been modified in order to support 
 suitable guard-checking.  For example, evaluation of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQ.html">member-eq</a> 3
 '(4 5))</span>, or equivalently, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> 3 '(4 5) :test 'eq)</span>, had produced a 
 value of <span class="v">nil</span>, but now we get what one should have expected: a guard 
 violation (since <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMBER-EQ.html">member-eq</a></span> is intended to compare symbols).  Thanks to 
 Yan Peng for raising a question on the acl2-help mailing list that led us to 
 make this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>When the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> command is supplied the macro alias for a 
 function symbol (see <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>), the system will now print 
 <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> not only for the macro symbol but also for the corresponding 
 function symbol.  Thanks to Cuong Chau, Jared Davis, Shilpi Goel, Sol Swords, 
 and Warren Hunt for requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <p>Some evaluations of forms <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a> :logic L :exec E)</span> are more efficient or 
 avoid guard violations, by evaluation of the <span class="v">:exec</span> form (<span class="v">E</span>) instead 
 of the <span class="v">:logic</span> form (<span class="v">L</span>).  If the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span> call is in a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode function definition, the <span class="v">:exec</span> code will be 
 evaluated, where unlike before, this is true even when guard-checking is 
 <span class="v">:all</span> or <span class="v">:none</span> (see <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>).  If the <span class="v">mbe</span> call 
 is in a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode function definition, the change is that the 
 <span class="v">:exec</span> code will be evaluated when there is a superior call of a 
 <span class="v">:program</span> mode function, except when guard-checking is <span class="v">:all</span> or 
 <span class="v">:none</span> or in a couple of technical cases (see a comment in the source code 
 for constant <span class="v">**1*-as-raw*</span> [formerly <span class="v">*mbe-as-exec*</span>] for details). 
 This use of <span class="v">:exec</span> code had been defeated when the superior <span class="v">:program</span> 
 mode function had an ``invariant-risk'' of making ill-guarded stobj updates. 
 However, there is no change in the case of safe-mode, which is used during 
 evaluation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VALUE-TRIPLE.html">value-triple</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> 
 forms, and during macroexpansion: the <span class="v">:logic</span> and <span class="v">:exec</span> forms are 
 still both evaluated and checked for equality.  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 reporting this issue and for helpful chats about it.  For more information, 
 see the comment about ``mbe and invariant-risk'' in the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a>
 note-6-5 ...)</span> in <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> file 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SAVE-EXEC.html">save-exec</a></span> has a new (optional) keyword argument, 
 <span class="v">:init-forms</span>, which specifies a list of forms to evaluate when first 
 entering the ACL2 read-eval-print loop, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a></span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for 
 requesting this enhancement.</p> 
 
 <h3>New Features</h3> 
 
 <p>A <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> event may now include the keyword argument 
 <span class="v">:non-memoizable</span>.  When its value if <span class="v">t</span>, then for ACL2(h) builds (see 
 <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>), code will run somewhat faster.  In a little test 
 doing just reads and writes to a stobj array in ACL2(h), it took 26% less time 
 when the stobj to be written was introduced by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a></span> using 
 <span class="v">:non-memoizable t</span>.  Thanks to Warren Hunt for requesting this 
 feature and helping to develop the test.</p> 
 
 <p>See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-BASE-RADIX.html">set-print-base-radix</a></span> for a utility that may be preferable to 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-BASE.html">set-print-base</a></span>, since it essentially calls <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-RADIX.html">set-print-radix</a></span> 
 automatically.  Thanks to David Rager, Shilpi Goel, and David Hardin for 
 participating in an acl2-help mailing list discussion that motivated this 
 feature.</p> 
 
 <h3>Heuristic Improvements</h3> 
 
 <p>One of the steps performed by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> has traditionally been 
 to check for local incompatibilities (see <a href="ACL2____LOCAL-INCOMPATIBILITY.html">local-incompatibility</a>) after 
 admitting all the events in the book.  This step involved rolling back the 
 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> to what it was at the start of certification, and then 
 including the book (see <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>).  As an optimization, we now 
 avoid rolling back the world more than necessary; see <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span>, 
 specifically the discussion of Step 3.  We thank Sol Swords for requesting 
 this optimization and for making a suggestion that improved it, pertaining to 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> (described above).  We also thank Jared Davis for alerting 
 us to an issue that turned out to be caused by a bug in our initial 
 implementation.  Sol has reported a nearly 20% reduction in time for 
 certifying a certain large collection of books.</p> 
 
 <p>The test for redundancy of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> has been made 
 more efficient.  Also, while the criterion itself remains unchanged, the 
 documentation has been made more accurate; see <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-ENCAPSULATE.html">redundant-encapsulate</a>. 
 We observed more than a 2% reduction in time for the ``everything'' regression 
 target, but we observed more than 23% of the time eliminated for the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a> (<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "doc/top" :dir :system))</span> after building the 
 documentation.  Thanks to David Rager for bringing that particular book to our 
 attention, as one that took a long time to include.</p> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PAIRLIS_42.html">pairlis$</a></span> is now tail-recursive, hence potentially more 
 efficient.  More precisely, its definition for the logic remains unchanged, 
 but using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a></span>, for execution it calls a new tail-recursive function, 
 <span class="v">pairlis$-tailrec</span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for requesting this 
 improvement.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">Linear</a> arithmetic has been strengthened slightly so that immediately 
 after simplification has ``settled down'' (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS-AND-THE-WATERFALL.html">hints-and-the-waterfall</a>), the unrewritten conclusion of a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LINEAR.html">linear</a></span> rule may be used when normally this would not be the case.  Thanks to 
 Robert Krug for reminding us of examples we had encountered that could benefit 
 from some such a change, and for pointing us to some relevant source code. 
 This improvement generally causes an extra pass through the simplifier; hence 
 we have observed approximately a 2% slowdown in the regression suite.  Note 
 that machinery is now in place for installing additional ``desperation 
 heuristics''; perhaps the ACL2 community will have some to suggest.</p> 
 
 <h3>Bug Fixes</h3> 
 
 <p>We fixed a soundness bug in how the <a href="ACL2____TAU-SYSTEM.html">tau-system</a> processed calls of 
 <span class="v">if</span>.  Thanks to Dmitry Nadezhin for reporting this bug by sending a simple 
 example that exploited it to prove <span class="v">nil</span>.  To see that example, see the 
 comment about ``tau soundness bug'' in the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> note-6-5 ...)</span> in 
 <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> file <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>We fixed a soundness bug for nested <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>s (see <a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a>). 
 In the case of a stobj producer variable that is not a child stobj, it had 
 been possible to update that stobj without returning it.  Thanks to Sol Swords 
 for reporting this bug and providing a corresponding proof of <span class="v">nil</span>, which 
 is included in a comment in the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> note-6-5 ...)</span> in <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> file <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>We fixed a soundness bug in the case of a <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> with a field that is 
 a resizable array of stobjs.  Thanks to Sol Swords for sending a proof of 
 <span class="v">nil</span> exploiting this bug, together with some helpful analysis attributing 
 the bug to a mistake in the generated logical definition of the corresponding 
 resize function.  (His example is included in a comment in the form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> note-6-5 ...)</span> in <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> file 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>(ACL2(h) only) We fixed a soundness bug involving the interaction of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a></span>, which thus is only a bug in ACL2(h) (see <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>), not in ACL2.  The fix was to add code to 
 <span class="v">stobj-let</span> that clears the memoization table for the parent stobj if any 
 child stobj is updated.  An example proof of <span class="v">nil</span> before this fix may be 
 found in the ACL2 source file <span class="v">translate.lisp</span>, in a comment in the 
 function <span class="v">stobj-let-fn-raw</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>(Allegro CL and CMUCL only) We fixed bugs in function <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PRINC_42.html">princ$</a></span> when 
 invoked in an ACL2 image with Allegro CL or CMUCL as the host Lisp 
 implementation.  In Allegro CL, when printing a complex number in base 16, 
 lower case characters were produced, for example printing <span class="v">#C(c d)</span> instead 
 of the characters predicted by the axioms, namely <span class="v">#C(C D)</span>.  In some 
 recent versions of CMUCL, after executing the forms <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-BASE.html">set-print-base</a> 16
 state)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-CASE.html">set-print-case</a> :downcase state)</span>, hex digits were printed in 
 lower case, unlike other host Lisps and contrary to the ACL2 axioms: for 
 example, 1000 base 10 was printed as <span class="v">3e8</span> rather than as predicted by the 
 ACL2 axioms, <span class="v">3E8</span>.  Thanks to Jared Davis for bringing these bugs to our 
 attention, and also for pointing out excessive printing of a big note about 
 such printing in Allegro CL.  We now avoid that note altogether, which had 
 warned that printing numbers in base 16 can be slow for Allegro CL.  In fact, 
 that performance issue has been eliminated: for example, after evaluating 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a> *c* (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 200000))</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-PRINT-BASE.html">set-print-base</a> 16 state)</span>, the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TIME_42.html">time$</a> (<a href="ACL2____PPROGN.html">pprogn</a> (<a href="ACL2____PRINC_42.html">princ$</a> *c* *standard-co* state) state))</span> reports 
 taking about 3 seconds before the change but about 1/100 seconds after the 
 change.  Thanks to David Margolies of Franz Inc. for passing along a remark 
 from a colleague that showed how to make this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL_B2.html">sys-call+</a></span> can now only be called if there is an active 
 <a href="ACL2____TRUST-TAG.html">trust-tag</a>, which is the restriction that was already in place for 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYS-CALL.html">sys-call</a></span>.  This plugs a potential soundness hole.</p> 
 
 <p>We have made several system functions untouchable (see <a href="ACL2____REMOVE-UNTOUCHABLE.html">remove-untouchable</a>), in order to prevent soundness bugs.  We thank Jared 
 Davis and Sol Swords for sending us an example that used a call of one of 
 these functions to prove <span class="v">nil</span>.  We have placed that example into a comment 
 in Community Books file <span class="tt">system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>, form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a>
 note-6-5 ...)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">brr</span> command, <span class="v">:wonp</span>, had not been installed for use after 
 <span class="v">:eval</span> even though this was claimed in the documentation (see <a href="ACL2____BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a>).  This has been fixed.  Thanks to David Rager for bringing this 
 issue to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> that could cause <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> to 
 fail with a bogus message about ``the set of ttags permitted 
 in the current context.''  Thanks to Sol Swords and Anna Slobodova for 
 reporting this bug, and to Sol for sending a small example that illustrated 
 the problem.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug that was wrongly disallowing certain calls of exported 
 functions for abstract stobjs (see <a href="ACL2____DEFABSSTOBJ.html">defabsstobj</a>).  Thanks to Sol Swords 
 for reporting this bug, supplying an example illustrating the bug, and 
 suggesting a nice fix.  A slight variant of his example is included in a 
 comment in Community Books file <span class="tt">system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>, form 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> note-6-5 ...)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>When a macro symbol <span class="v">mac</span> was a macro-alias for a function symbol 
 <span class="v">f</span> (see <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>), then the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS_B2.html">verify-guards+</a>
 mac)</span> caused an error when encountered while including an uncertified book. 
 This problem has been fixed.  Thanks to Jared Davis for pointing out the 
 problem and sending a simple example to illustrate it.  Technical Note: the 
 actual problem was that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS_B2.html">verify-guards+</a></span> generates a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a></span> with an <span class="v">:expansion?</span> argument, and that argument needed to be 
 ignored (as it now is, after the fix) when including an uncertified book.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WALKABOUT.html">walkabout</a></span> utility could cause hard Lisp errors when the current 
 package is other than <span class="v">"ACL2"</span>.  This has been fixed.  Thanks to Sol 
 Swords for bringing this bug to our attention and suggesting a fix.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes at the System Level</h3> 
 
 <p>(SBCL only) Fixed the executable script generated for SBCL so that 
 <span class="v">SBCL_HOME</span> is set to the SBCL <span class="v">obj/sbcl-home/</span> directory if it exists, 
 since that fix seems needed for some recent versions of SBCL (1.1.14 in 
 particular).</p> 
 
 <p>File <span class="v">GNUmakefile</span> in the ACL2 sources directory wasn't passing the 
 value of shell variable <span class="v">ACL2</span> from target <span class="v">certify-books-fresh</span> to 
 target <span class="v">certify-books</span>, and similarly for target 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/render-doc.cert</span> (invoked by target <span class="v">DOC</span>).  This has 
 been fixed.  We thank Jared Davis and Camm Maguire for helpful 
 discussions.</p> 
 
 <p>The "make DOC" command was not completing correctly when variable 
 <span class="v">ACL2</span> was not set.  Also, for host Lisp CMUCL at least, it stalled at the 
 terminal unless a quit command was issued twice (as ACL2 was stuck without 
 exiting).  Those problems have been resolved.  Thanks to Jim Ward for bringing 
 these issues to our attention</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the error message when encountering an illegal comma while reading 
 input (i.e., for a comma not within a suitable nesting of backquotes).  Thanks 
 to Jared Davis for bringing this issue to our attention and for a helpful 
 discussion.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) Arranged for state global <span class="v">'tmp-dir</span> to be set to GCL's 
 <span class="v">si::*tmp-dir*</span>, even on Windows; this may be important for compilation on 
 Windows.  Thanks to Camm Maguire for pointing out the need to set 
 <span class="v">'tmp-dir</span> for ACL2 built on GCL on mingw.</p> 
 
 <p>(GCL only) Now, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GC_42.html">gc$</a></span> may be called with no arguments, in which case 
 the missing argument for <span class="v">system::gc</span> is <span class="v">t</span>.</p> 
 
 <h3>EMACS Support</h3> 
 
 <p>Improvements to the <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-Doc</a> browser include the following.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>A new `<span class="v">w</span>' command displays the topic name in the minibuffer, together 
 with the manual name (ACL2+Books Manual or ACL2 User's Manual).</li> 
 
 <li>Improved the `<span class="v">control-t .</span>' command so that the default topic is 
 selected just as in acl2-doc mode.  (Technically: the same syntax table is 
 used for `<span class="v">control-t .</span>' as is used in the <span class="v">acl2-doc</span> buffer for that 
 command and the `<span class="v">g</span>' command.)</li> 
 
 <li>Improved the search commands so that the display doesn't move when the 
 next occurrence is already displayed on the screen.</li> 
 
 <li>Eliminated the deprecated commands `<span class="v">Control-x a A</span>', 
 `<span class="v">Control-x a a</span>', and `<span class="v">Control-t G</span>'.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h3>Experimental/Alternate Versions</h3> 
 
 <p>For ACL2(r), Ruben Gamboa found a bug in constraints for functions 
 introduced with <span class="v">defun-std</span>, and also kindly provided a fix, which has been 
 incorporated.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified ACL2(hp) so that two system functions that had been <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNMEMOIZE.html">unmemoize</a></span>d when turning on <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">waterfall-parallelism</a> — 
 <span class="v">fchecksum-obj</span> and <span class="v">expansion-alist-pkg-names-memoize</span> — now 
 remain memoized.  This can greatly improve performance when using ACL2(hp) 
 with <a href="ACL2____WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">waterfall-parallelism</a> on, in particular community book 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/render-doc-combined.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Made miscellaneous small improvements to ACL2(h).</p> 
 
 <p>The utilities <span class="v">hons-shrink-alist</span> and <span class="v">hons-shrink-alist!</span> have 
 essentially been renamed to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-FORK.html">fast-alist-fork</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-FORK_12.html">fast-alist-fork!</a></span>, respectively.  The old names are deprecated but remain as 
 macros that are macro-aliases for the respective new names (see <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>).  New utilities, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-CLEAN.html">fast-alist-clean</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-CLEAN_12.html">fast-alist-clean!</a></span> are similar to the above but take just one argument and, if 
 it is a fast alist, associates the result with the hash table link of that 
 argument.  Thanks to Jared Davis for providing a concrete proposal, together 
 with the new names, for what had been only a concept.</p>
