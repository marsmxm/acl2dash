<p>Disassemble a function</p><p>The macro <span class="v">disassemble$</span> provides a convenient interface to the 
 underlying <span class="v">disassemble</span> utility of the host Common Lisp implementation, 
 which prints assembly code for a given function symbol at the terminal.  If 
 the argument is instead a macro alias for a function symbol (see <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>), then it prints assembly code for that function symbol 
 instead.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Disassemble$</span> works by including the community book 
 <span class="v">books/misc/disassemble.lisp</span>, which defines the supporting function 
 <span class="v">disassemble$-fn</span>, and then by calling that function.  Note that the 
 arguments to <span class="v">disassemble$</span> are evaluated.  Also note that 
 <span class="v">disassemble$</span> is intended as a top-level utility for the ACL2 loop, not to 
 be called in code; for such a purpose, include the above book and call 
 <span class="v">disassemble$-fn</span> directly.</p>

 <p>where <span class="v">form</span> evaluates to a function symbol or a macro alias for a 
 function symbol and <span class="v">flg</span> evaluates to any value.  If <span class="v">flg</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, 
 then the existing definition of that function symbol is disassembled.  But if 
 <span class="v">flg</span> is supplied and has a value other than <span class="v">nil</span> or <span class="v">:default</span>, and 
 if that function symbol is defined in the ACL2 loop (not merely in raw Lisp; 
 for example, see <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a>), then the disassembly will be based on a 
 recompilation of that ACL2 definition.  Normally this recompilation is not 
 necessary, but for some host Lisps, it may be useful; in particular, for CCL 
 the above book arranges that source code information is saved, so that the 
 output is annotated with such information.  When recompilation takes place, 
 the previous definition is restored after disassembly is complete.  Finally, 
 if <span class="v">flg</span> is omitted or has the value <span class="v">:default</span>  i.e., in the 
 default case  then recompilation may take place or not, depending on 
 the host Lisp.  The values of <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> host-lisp)</span> for which recompilation takes 
 place by default may be found by looking at the above book, or by including it 
 and evaluating the constant <span class="v">*host-lisps-that-recompile-by-default*</span>.  As 
 of this writing, CCL is the only such Lisp (because that is the one for which 
 we can obtain source annotation in the output by recompiling).</p>
