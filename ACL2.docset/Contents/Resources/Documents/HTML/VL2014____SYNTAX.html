<p>Representation of Verilog structures.</p><p>We now describe our representation of Verilog's syntactic 
structures.  For each kind of Verilog construct (expressions, statements, 
declarations, instances, etc.) we introduce recognizer, constructor, and 
accessor functions that enforce certain basic well-formedness criteria.</p> 
 
<p>These structures correspond fairly closely to parse trees in the Verilog 
grammar, although we make many simplifcations and generally present a much more 
regular view of the source code.</p>
