<p>Evaluate a form and print subsequent error trace</p><p>The acronym ``wet'' stands for ``with-error-trace''.  <span class="v">Wet</span> 
 provides a convenient way to obtain a backtrace when evaluation causes a guard 
 violation or other error.</p> 
 
 <h3>Summary Documentation</h3> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____WET.html">wet</a> form           ; an arbitrary form
     :book bk-form  ; optional, not evaluated; specify different wet book
     ;;; the rest are optional and evaluated:
     :compile c     ; :same, t, or nil; default :same (nil if :fns supplied)
     :fullp h       ; nil by default, else handle some raw Lisp errors
     :evisc-tuple e ; an evisc-tuple
     :fns fns       ; :all, or a list of functions to show in a backtrace</pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Form</span> is evaluated.  If there is an error, a backtrace stack is printed 
 to the standard output (<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2STANDARD-CO_A2.html">*standard-co*</a></span>), containing (by default) the 
 user-defined function calls made before the error.  Such printing is 
 controlled by the <span class="v">:evisc-tuple</span> if supplied; otherwise, hiding of large 
 structures will occur.</p> 
 
 <h3>Discussion</h3> 
 
 <p>The basic idea is that <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____WET.html">wet</a> form)</span> evaluates <span class="v">form</span> and, if there is 
 an error, shows a backtrace of calls that led to that error.  Note however 
 that by default only calls of user-defined (not built-in) functions 
 ``supporting'' <span class="v">form</span> in the following sense will show up in the backtrace: 
 those that occur in the macroexpansion of <span class="v">form</span> or (recursively) support 
 any of those functions.  So for example, since <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a> form)</span> 
 macroexpands to <span class="v">(make-event-fn (<a href="COMMON-LISP____QUOTE.html">quote</a> form) ...)</span>, calls of functions 
 occurring in <span class="v">form</span> will likely not show up in the backtrace by default. 
 The option <span class="v">:fns all</span> overrides this default, with potential loss of speed; 
 more on this below.</p> 
 
 <p>The following example explains the use of <span class="v">wet</span>.  First, submit the 
 following three definitions:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x))) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> bar (x) (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (x) (bar (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now imagine you have obtained the following guard violation:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> '(3 4))

ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function call (FOO X),
which is (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X), is violated by the arguments in the call (FOO NIL).

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>With <span class="v">wet</span>, you can get a backtrace of user-defined functions.  The 
 package prefixes shown below, <span class="v">ACL2_*1*_</span>, indicate that the 
 executable-counterparts of the corresponding submitted functions are being 
 called; see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a>.  Don't forget to start with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a>
 "misc/wet" :dir :system)</span>.</p>

 <p>By default, large structures are hidden during the printing of the 
 backtrace stack.  (Technical detail: by default the global abbrev-evisc-tuple 
 is used, if bound; see <a href="ACL2____SET-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-evisc-tuple</a>.  But you can supply a value for 
 keyword argument <span class="v">:evisc-tuple</span> to modify the printing: <span class="v">nil</span> to avoid 
 hiding, else a suitable evisc-tuple, as shown below (see <a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a>).</p>

The message above might explain the error.  If not, and
if you didn't cause an explicit interrupt (Control-C),
then the root cause may be call of a :program mode
function that has the wrong guard specified, or even no
guard specified (i.e., an implicit guard of t).
See :DOC raw-lisp-error and see :DOC guards.

ACL2 Error in WET:  The guard for the :program function call (FOO X),
which is (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X), is violated by the arguments in the call (FOO 5).

Backtrace stack:
----------------
1. (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::FOO 5)
2. (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::BAR (4 . 5))
3. (ACL2_*1*_ACL2::G (3 4 . 5))

 <p>Why doesn't <span class="v">wet</span> always do things this way?  The answer pertains to 
 performance.  When <span class="v">:fullp</span> is non-nil, <span class="v">wet</span> sets guard-checking to 
 <span class="v">:all</span> before evaluating the given form; see <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>. 
 This may slow down evaluation substantially, which is why it is not the 
 default behavior.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:fns</span> option.  As mentioned above, by default the <span class="v">wet</span> 
 backtrace shows user-defined functions that syntactically ``support'' the form 
 being evaluated.  This default can be overridden by supplying an explicit 
 list, <span class="v">fns</span>, of functions, using option <span class="v">:fns fns</span>; these will then be 
 the functions whose calls are eligible for inclusion in the backtrace.  The 
 special value <span class="v">:fns :all</span> will allow all user-defined function calls in the 
 backtrace.  This value can be useful when using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAGIC-EV-FNCALL.html">magic-ev-fncall</a></span>, for 
 example, since the function being applied isn't typically included as a 
 syntactic supporter of the form being evaluated.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:compile</span> option.  <span class="v">Wet</span> uses the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span> utility to 
 modify the definitions of affected functions so that they can record 
 information for the backtrace.  As described above, these affected functions 
 are those that syntactically ``support'' the form unless specified by the 
 <span class="v">:fns</span> option.  As is the case for <span class="v">trace$</span> â€” see <a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a> 
 â€” the new definitions of these affected functions may or may not be 
 compiled.  For <span class="v">trace$</span> and for <span class="v">wet</span>, the default is to compile the new 
 definition if and only if the original definition was compiled, except: For 
 <span class="v">wet</span>, if option <span class="v">:fns :all</span> is provided, then the default is not to 
 compile the affected definitions.  And for <span class="v">trace$</span> and <span class="v">wet</span>, the 
 <span class="v">:compile</span> option overrides the default, to specify what will be compiled: 
 value <span class="v">:same</span> to compile each affected function if and only if its original 
 definition was compiled, value <span class="v">t</span> to compile all affected functions, and 
 value <span class="v">nil</span> to skip compilation.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:book</span> option.  <span class="v">Wet</span> actually works by temporarily including a 
 community book,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "misc/wet" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
 <p>and then passing its arguments to macro <span class="v">wet!</span>, defined in that book. 
 The keyword argument <span class="v">:book</span> allows you to specify a different book that 
 defines a macro <span class="v">wet!</span> to which to pass its arguments.  If the value of 
 <span class="v">:book</span> is a string, then the book named by that string is temporarily 
 included using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "bk")</span>.  Otherwise 
 <span class="v">:book</span> should be a list of arguments, to be provided (unevaluated) to 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>, for example <span class="v">("my-wet" :dir :my-utils)</span>.  Thus you 
 can experiment by copying community book <span class="v">books/misc/wet.lisp</span> to your own 
 directory and making modifications to the copy.  If you make changes, we 
 invite you to share them with the ACL2 community (see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>).  Note 
 that you can also supply <span class="v">:book nil</span>, in which case the definition of 
 <span class="v">wet!</span> in your current session will be used without including a book.</p> 
 
 <h3>Concluding Remark</h3> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a> for a general tracing utility.  As mentioned above, 
 <span class="v">wet</span> is implemented using <span class="v">trace$</span>.  <span class="v">Wet</span> actually first applies 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNTRACE_42.html">untrace$</a></span>; upon completion, <span class="v">wet</span> then applies <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span> to 
 re-trace any functions that it had untraced, using their original trace 
 specs.</p>
