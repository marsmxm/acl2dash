</dl><p>These are the proof obligations that arise from expressions.</p><p>A proof obligation consists of 
     a list of typed variables, 
     a list of hypotheses, 
     and a conclusion. 
     One can form a formula from it, 
     universally quantified over the variables, 
     where each hypothesis becomes 
     an implication antecedent (when it is an expression) 
     or a let binding (when it is a binding),, 
     and where the conclusion becomes the final 
     implication consequent or let binding body. 
     This formula construction will be defined later.</p>
