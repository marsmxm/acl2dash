<p>The prompt printed by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span></p><p>The prompt printed by ACL2 conveys information about various 
 ``modes.''  See <a href="ACL2____DEFAULT-PRINT-PROMPT.html">default-print-prompt</a> and see <a href="ACL2____LD-PROMPT.html">ld-prompt</a> for 
 details.</p> 
 
 <p>The prompt during raw Lisp breaks is, with most Common Lisp 
 implementations, adjusted by ACL2 to include the string <span class="v">"[RAW LISP</span>"], 
 in order to reminder users not to submit ACL2 forms there; see <a href="ACL2____BREAKS.html">breaks</a>. 
 For Lisps that seem to use the same code for printing prompts at the top-level 
 as in <a href="ACL2____BREAKS.html">breaks</a>, the top-level prompt is similarly adjusted.  For Lisps 
 with the above prompt adjustment, The following forms may be executed in raw 
 Lisp (i.e., after typing <span class="v">:q</span>).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(install-new-raw-prompt) ; install prompt with [RAW LISP] as described above
(install-old-raw-prompt) ; revert to original prompt from host Common Lisp</pre>
