<p>Theorem about no points with abscissa -1 on a Montgomery curve.</p><p>If (A - 2) / B is not a square, 
     then the Montgomery curve has no pont with x = -1. 
     The proof is obtained by substituting  x = -1 in the curve equation, 
     obtaining an equality of y^2 to (A - 2) / B, 
     and thus concluding the impossibility of x = -1. 
     But we need to disable some distributivity rules 
     because otherwise they take things in the wrong direction.</p><p>This theorem has some significance, in particular, for the <a href="ECURVE____BIRATIONAL-MONTGOMERY-TWISTED-EDWARDS.html">birational equivalence between 
                     Montgomery and twisted Edwards curves</a>: points with x = -1 on a Montgomery curve 
     are not amenable to the rational mapping, 
     because they make a denominator zero. 
     This theorem, under the aforementioned condition on A and B, 
     tells us that there is no such point.</p><p>Note that (A - 2) / B is the d coefficient 
     of the birationally equivalent twisted Edwards curve. 
     In particular, if the Montgomery curve is birationally equivalent 
     to a complete twisted Edwards curve, which is characterized by 
     a being a square and d not being a square, 
     then the hypothesis of this theorem is satisfied. 
     Since complete twisted Edwards curves are often used 
     because of their completeness, 
     this theorem tells us that 
     the birationally equivalent Montgomery curve 
     has no exceptional point for x = -1.</p>
