<p>Dynamically monitor rewrites and other prover activity</p><p>In addition to utilities that allow you to set breakpoints or print 
 rewriting information to the screen — see <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> — 
 ACL2 provides a utility for watching the activity of the rewriter and some 
 other proof processes, in real time.  This utility is called ``dmr'', which is 
 an acronym for ``dynamically monitor rewrites''.  The utility comes in two 
 parts: an ACL2 component that frequently updates a file (the ``dmr file'') 
 containing the relevant information, and an Emacs component that frequently 
 updates an Emacs buffer (the ``dmr buffer'') with the contents of that 
 file.  Other editors could, in principle, be programmed to display that file; 
 anyone developing such a capability is invited to contribute it to the ACL2 
 community.</p> 
 
 <p>The dmr utility can be extremely helpful for expensive proofs, especially 
 when ACL2 is not providing any output to the terminal.  The <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a></span> utilities may be a bit 
 easier to use, so you might want to try those first.  But the dmr utility can 
 be a very helpful debugging aide, as it can visually give you a sense of where 
 ACL2 is spending its time.</p> 
 
 <p>The Emacs portion of this utility is already loaded if you load the 
 distributed Emacs file <span class="v">emacs-acl2.el</span> from a suitable directory; see <a href="ACL2____EMACS.html">emacs</a>.  Otherwise, load into Emacs the file <span class="v">monitor.el</span> from that same 
 directory.  (You only need to do that once in your Emacs session.)  Then each 
 time you want to observe the rewriter in action, invoke the following to see 
 it displayed in a buffer, which we call the ``dmr buffer'':</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Control-t 1</pre> 
 
 <p>But first you will need to enable monitoring at the ACL2 level:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(dmr-start)</pre> 
 
 <p>Monitoring has some cost.  So if you have started it, then at some point 
 you may want to turn it off when not using it.  Any time the dmr buffer 
 (generally called <span class="v">"acl2-dmr-&lt;user_name&gt;"</span>) is not visible, Emacs 
 monitoring is turned off.  You can also turn off Emacs monitoring explicitly, 
 with:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Control-t 2</pre> 
 
 <p>At the ACL2 level you can disable monitoring as follows:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(dmr-stop)</pre> 
 
 <p><i>Interpreting the dmr buffer display.</i></p> 
 
 <p>We explain the dmr buffer display by way of the following example.  It is a 
 snapshot of a dmr buffer taken from one of the community books, 
 <span class="v">books/workshops/2004/legato/support/proof-by-generalization-mult.lisp</span>.</p>

 <p>Each line indicates an ACL2 activity that leads to the activity shown on 
 the line just below it.  Moreover, lines are sometimes collapsed to make the 
 display more compact.  Consider for example the first few lines.  Above, we 
 are proving a theorem named <span class="v">WP-ZCOEF-G-MULTIPLIES</span>.  Lines 1 and 2 show 
 the clause simplification process invokes the rewriter on the 18th literal. 
 (Recall that a clause is a disjunction of literals; for example the clause 
 <span class="v">{(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> A), (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> B), C}</span> would be displayed as <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">AND</a> A B) C)</span>.) 
 This 18th literal mentioned on line 2 is a function call <span class="v">(f arg1 ...)</span>, 
 and ``<span class="v">argument(<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a>) 1</span>'' indicates that the rewriter, which works 
 inside-out, is considering the first argument (``<span class="v">arg1</span>'').  Thus the 
 display could instead have shown the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">2. Rewriting (to simplify) the atom of literal 18
3. Rewriting (to simplify) the first argument
4. Rewriting (to simplify) the expansion; argument(<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a>) 3|2</pre> 
 
 <p>But it saved space to combine lines 2 and 3.  Line 4 suggests that the 
 above <span class="v">arg1</span> is a function call that has been opened up because of an 
 <span class="v">:expand</span> hint or, perhaps, an expansion directed explicitly by the prover 
 (as can happen during induction).  The annotation ``<span class="v">argument(<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a>) 3|2</span>'' 
 then indicates that the rewriter is diving into the third argument of the 
 expansion, and then into the second argument of that.  Let us call the result 
 <span class="v">term7</span> (since it is the one to be considered on line 7).</p> 
 
 <p>Now consider the next two lines:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">   7. Applying (:DEFINITION WP-ZCOEF-G)
*  8. Rewriting (to simplify) the rewritten body; argument(<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a>) 2|1|2|2</pre> 
 
 <p>Line 7 is saying that <span class="v">term7</span> (defined above) is modified by applying 
 the definition of <span class="v">WP-ZCOEF-G</span> to it.  Line 8 then says that the body of 
 this definition has been rewritten (with its formals bound to the actuals from 
 <span class="v">term7</span>) and the rewriter is diving into the subterms of that rewritten 
 body, as indicated.  Notice also that line 8 is the first line marked with an 
 asterisk (``<span class="v">*</span>'') in the margin.  This line is the first that is different 
 from what was shown the previous time the display was updated (about 1/10 
 second earlier, by default).  When a line is marked with an asterisk, so are 
 all the lines below it; so the lines without an asterisk are those that have 
 been stable since the last display.  In this example we may see line 7 marked 
 without an asterisk for a while, which suggests that the rule <span class="v">(:DEFINITION
 WP-ZCOEF-G)</span> is expensive.  (Also see <a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a>.)  In 
 general, a line that persists for awhile without a leading asterisk can 
 suggest why the proof is taking a long time.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally let us consider line 13 and the two lines below it.  The phrase 
 <span class="v">"'Applying (:REWRITE MOD-ZERO . 2)"</span> says that the indicated rewrite 
 rule is being considered for application to the current term.  There are very 
 weak criteria for ``Applying'' to be printed: the rule must be enabled, and 
 top-level function symbols much suitably match for the term and the rule.  In 
 particular, the ``Applying'' line does not imply that the rule actually 
 matches the term.  That said: in the case of line 13, matching clearly was 
 successful, since line 14 indicates an attempt to establish the rule's fourth 
 hypothesis.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, note the indentation of line 14 relative to line 13.  Extra 
 indentation occurs when an attempt is being made to relieve a hypothesis 
 (i.e., rewrite it to <span class="v">t</span>).  In particular, rewrites that will be 
 incorporated directly into a (top-level) literal are all indented just two 
 spaces, starting with the first rewrite directly under a process such as 
 <span class="v">SIMPLIFY-CLAUSE</span> (shown line 1 above).  If the indentation is at least the 
 value of raw Lisp variable <span class="v">*dmr-indent-max*</span> (by default, 20), then the 
 indentation is restricted to that column, but ACL2 prints <span class="v">{n}</span> where n is 
 the column that would have been used for indentation if there were no 
 maximum.</p> 
 
 <p>You can move the cursor around in the dmr buffer even while it is being 
 updated.  But emacs will attempt to keep the cursor no later than the first 
 asterisk (``<span class="v">*</span>'') in the margin.  Thus, you can move the cursor around in 
 the stable part of the display, and emacs will keep the cursor in that stable 
 part.</p> 
 
 <p>WARNING: Things could go terribly wrong if the same user runs two different 
 ACL2 sessions with dmr active, because the same file will be written by two 
 different ACL2 processes.</p> 
 
 <p>WARNING: For dmr to work, emacs and ACL2 need to be run on the same machine 
 because the file used to communicate between ACL2 and emacs is under 
 <span class="v">/tmp</span>.  Except, you can probably hack around that restriction by changing 
 <span class="v">*dmr-file-name*</span> in ACL2 (in raw Lisp) and correspondingly in Emacs file 
 <span class="v">monitor.el</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>More generally, advanced users are welcome to search for the string</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">User-settable dmr variables</pre> 
 
 <p>in ACL2 files <span class="v">interface-raw.lisp</span> and <span class="v">emacs/monitor.el</span> in order to 
 customize their dmr environments.</p> 
 
 <p>In order to update the dmr file with the latest stack information, 
 interrupt ACL2 and then evaluate: <span class="v">(dmr-flush)</span>.  In order to support 
 resumption of the interrupted proof (assuming your host Common Lisp supports 
 resumption), evaluation of <span class="v">(dmr-start)</span> will automatically enable the 
 debugger if it is not already enabled and not fully disabled with value 
 <span class="v">:never</span> (see <a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a>).  If such automatic enabling 
 takes place, then <span class="v">(dmr-stop)</span> will restore the old setting of the debugger 
 unless, after <span class="v">(dmr-start)</span> enables the debugger but before <span class="v">(dmr-stop)</span> 
 is called, you call <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a></span> (or more precisely: function 
 <span class="v">set-debugger-enable-fn</span> is called).</p> 
 
 <p>Note for users of the experimental extension ACL2(p) (see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>): when waterfall-parallelism has been set to a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value 
 (see <a href="ACL2____SET-WATERFALL-PARALLELISM.html">set-waterfall-parallelism</a>), statistics about parallel execution 
 are printed instead of the usual information.</p>
