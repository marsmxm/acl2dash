<p>Pretty-printing of expressions.</p><p>The tree structure of the abstract syntax of C expressions 
     describes the grouping of nested subexpressions. 
     For instance, the tree</p><pre class="code">(<a href="C____EXPR-BINARY.html">expr-binary</a> (<a href="C____BINOP-MUL.html">binop-mul</a>)
             (<a href="C____EXPR-BINARY.html">expr-binary</a> (<a href="C____BINOP-ADD.html">binop-add</a>)
                          (<a href="C____EXPR-IDENT.html">expr-ident</a> (<a href="C____MAKE-IDENT.html">make-ident</a> :name "x"))

     Note that, when this expression is written in concrete syntax as just done, 
     parentheses must be added, 
     because <span class="v">*</span> binds tighter (i.e. has a higher priority) than <span class="v">+</span> 
     in C.</p><p>The relative priorities of C operators are implicitly defined 
     by the C grammar of expressions, 
     which also defines the left vs. right associativity 
     of binary operators. 
     For instance, the rules in [C:6.5.5] and [C:6.5.6] tell us that 
     (i) <span class="v">+</span> binds tighter than <span class="v">*</span> and 
     (ii) <span class="v">+</span> is left-associative:</p><ul>
<li>Consider an expression <span class="v">x + y * z</span>. 
      In order to parse this as a <i>multiplicative-expression</i>, 
      <span class="v">x + y</span> would have to be a <i>multiplicative-expression</i>), 
      which is not. 
      Thus, the original expression can only be parsed 
      as an <i>additive-expression</i>.</li>
<li>Consider an expression <span class="v">x * y + z</span>. 
      In order to parse this as a <i>multiplicative-expression</i>, 
      <span class="v">y + z</span> would have to be a <i>cast-expression</i>, 
      which is not. 
      Thus, the original expression can only be parsed 
      as an <i>additive-expression</i>.</li>
<li>Consider an expression <span class="v">x + y + z</span>. 
      In order to right-associate it (i.e. <span class="v">x + (y + z)</span>), 
      <span class="v">y + z</span> would have to be a <i>multiplicative-expression</i>, 
      which is not. 
      Thus, the original expression can only be left-associated 
      (i.e. <span class="v">(x + y) + z</span>).</li>
</ul><p>Our pretty-printer adds parentheses 
     based on the relative priorities of the C operators 
     and the left or right associativity of the C binary operators, 
     following the grammar. 
     The approach is explained in the following paragraphs.</p><p>We define `grades' of expressions 
     that correspond to certain nonterminals of the C grammar, 
     such as a the grade of additive expressions 
     corresponding to the nonterminal <i>additive-expression</i>. 
     We define a mapping from the expressions of our abstract syntax 
     to their grades, 
     e.g. <span class="v">(<a href="C____EXPR-BINARY.html">expr-binary</a> (<a href="C____BINOP-ADD.html">binop-add</a>) ... ...)</span> 
     and <span class="v">(<a href="C____EXPR-BINARY.html">expr-binary</a> (<a href="C____BINOP-SUB.html">binop-sub</a>) ... ...)</span> 
     are mapped to the grade of additive expressions.</p><p>We define a total order on expression grades that is 
     the reflexive and transitive closure of the binary relation 
     that consists of the pairs <span class="v">grade1 &lt; grade2</span> such that 
     there is a grammar (sub)rule <i>nonterm2: nonterm1</i> 
     saying that the nonterminal <i>nonterm2</i> corresponding to <span class="v">grade2</span> 
     may expand to the nonterminal <i>nonterm1</i> corresponding to <span class="v">grade1</span>. 
     For instance, <span class="v">grade1</span> is the grade of multiplicative expressions 
     and <span class="v">grade2</span> is the grade of additive expressions, 
     because there is a (sub)rule 
     <i>additive-expression: multiplicative-expression</i> in the grammar. 
     (Here by 'subrule' we mean a rule not necessarily in the grammar 
     but obtainable by selecting just some of the alternatives in the definiens 
     that are on different lines in [C].) 
     The nonterminal <i>additive-expression</i> also has other alternatives, 
     but those are not single nonterminals; 
     here we are only concerned with single nonterminals as rule definientia. 
     The reason is explained below.</p><p>Besides the abstract syntactic expression to pretty-print, 
     the pretty-printer for expression has an argument 
     that is the grade of expression that must be pretty-printed 
     at that point. 
     At the top level, this second argument is 
     the grade of top-level expressions, 
     i.e. the grade that corresponds to 
     the nonterminal <i>expression</i> [C:6.5.17]. 
     As the pretty-printer descends into subexpressions, 
     the second argument is changed according to 
     the grammar rule corresponding to the super-expressions. 
     For instance, when pretty-printing the left and right subexpressions 
     of a super-expression <span class="v">(binary-expr (<a href="C____BINOP-ADD.html">binop-add</a>) left right)</span>, 
     we recursively call the pretty-printer twice, 
     once on <span class="v">left</span> and once on <span class="v">right</span>. 
     Because of the grammar rule 
     <i>additive-expression: 
        additive-expression <span class="tt">+</span> multiplicative-expression</i> 
     that corresponds to the super-expression, 
     the recursive call on <span class="v">left</span> will have as second argument 
     the grade of <i>additive-expression</i>, 
     while the recursive call on <span class="v">right</span> will have as second argument 
     the grade of <i>multiplicative-expression</i>. 
     The second argument of the pretty-printer is used as follows: 
     the pretty-printer compares the second argument 
     (i.e. the expected grade of expression) 
     with the grade of the expression passed as first argument 
     (i.e. the actual grade of expression), 
     according to the total order on expression grades described above; 
     if the actual grade is less than or equal to the expected grade, 
     the expression is pretty-printed without parentheses, 
     otherwise parentheses are added. 
     The reason why no parentheses are needed in the first case is that 
     the nonterminal for the expected grade can be expanded, 
     possibly in multiple steps, 
     into the nonterminal for the actual grade: 
     or conversely, the actual expression can be parsed 
     into an expression of the expected grade. 
     On the other hand, if the actual grade is greater than the expected grade, 
     there is no such possibility; 
     by adding parentheses, we change the grade of the actual expression 
     into the one at the bottom of the total order, 
     i.e. the grade corresponding to <i>primary-expression</i>, 
     which again lets the parenthesized expression be parsed 
     into an expression of the expected grade.</p><p>For instance, consider the abstract syntax tree for <span class="v">(x + y) * z</span>, 
     shown earlier as motivating example. 
     Assume that it is pretty-printed as a top-level expression, 
     i.e. that the second argument is the grade of <i>expression</i> 
     (the expected grade). 
     Since the actual grade of the expression is 
     the one for <i>multiplicative-expression</i>, 
     which is less than or equal to the one for <i>expression</i> 
     (via 
     <i>assignment-expression</i>, 
     <i>conditional-expression</i>, 
     <i>logical-OR-expression</i>, 
     <i>logical-AND-expression</i>, 
     <i>inclusive-OR-expression</i>, 
     <i>exclusive-OR-expression</i>, 
     <i>AND-expression</i>, 
     <i>equality-expression</i>, 
     <i>relational-expression</i>, 
     <i>shift-expression</i>, and 
     <i>additive-expression</i>), 
     no parentheses are printed at the top level. 
     When pretty-printing the left subexpression <span class="v">x + y</span>, 
     the expected grade is <i>multiplicative-expression</i>: 
     since the actual grade of <span class="v">x + y</span> is <i>additive-expression</i>, 
     which is greater than the expected grade, 
     parentheses must be added, 
     as mentioned when the example was first presented. 
     On the other hand, when pretty-printing the right subexpression <span class="v">z</span>, 
     the expected grade is <i>cast-expression</i>: 
     since the actual grade of <span class="v">z</span> is <i>primary-expression</i>, 
     which is less than the expected grade, 
     no parentheses are printed.</p><p>The total order on expression grades only considers, as mentioned, 
     (sub)rules of the form <i>nonterm2: nonterm1</i> 
     where <i>nonterm1</i> is a single nonterminal. 
     Rule definientia that are not single terminals 
     are captured as tree structures in our abstract syntax, 
     and thus have their own explicit grade. 
     On the other hand, single-nonterminal definientia 
     do not correspond to any tree structure, 
     but rather allow the same expression to have, in effect, 
     different grades (a form of subtyping).</p>
