<p>Java identifiers [JLS:3.8].</p><p>Java identifiers are sequences of characters that, among other things, 
     must differ from Java keywords. 
     Since, as discussed in the <a href="JAVA____KEYWORDS.html">topic on keywords</a>, there are non-restricted and restricted Java keywords, 
     correspondingly there are two kinds of Java identifiers. 
     One kind excludes only non-restricted keywords: 
     these identifiers are usable in most contexts. 
     The other kind excludes restricted keywords as well 
     (with a slight exception; see <span class="tt"><a href="JAVA____MIDENTIFIER.html">midentifier</a></span>): 
     these identifiers are usable in certain module-related contexts.</p><p>Here we also formalize Java type identifiers [JLS:3.8], 
     which are slightly more restricted identifiers.</p>
