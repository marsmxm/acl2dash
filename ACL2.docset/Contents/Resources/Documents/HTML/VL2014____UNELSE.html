<p>Convert <span class="v">if/else</span> statements into blocks of independent 
<span class="v">if</span>-statements.</p><p>This is a preprocessing step in synthesizing always blocks.</p> 
 
<p>The idea is to eliminate any else statements by turning an <span class="v">if/else</span> 
statement into a pair of <span class="v">if</span> statements with inverted conditions.  That 
is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">if (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a>)   --&gt;   begin
   body1            if (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a>) body1
else                if (!cond) body2
   body2          end</pre> 
 
<p>This transform used to be important, but now VL has smarter edge-triggered 
block handling, so it is probably not at all useful.  We don't even run this 
until after combinational and flop-like always blocks have already been 
transformed, and even then, it seems unlikely that this could actually help 
with latch synthesis.</p> 
 
<p>We expect it to be run only after expressions are sized.</p>
