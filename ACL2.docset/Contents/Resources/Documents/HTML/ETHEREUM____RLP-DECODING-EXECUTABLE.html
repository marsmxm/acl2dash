<p>Executable definitions of RLP decoding.</p><p>We provide executable definitions of RLP decoding for 
     trees, byte arrays, and scalars. 
     We prove the correctness of these executable definitions with respect to 
     the <a href="ETHEREUM____RLP-DECODING-DECLARATIVE.html">declarative 
     definitions</a>.</p><p>We start with an executable RLP parser for trees 
     that accepts extra bytes after the encoding 
     and that returns those extra bytes as additional result; 
     this is a natural approach for this kind of recursive parsing. 
     We prove that this parser is both left and right inverse, 
     modulo the extra bytes, 
     of the RLP tree encoder.</p><p>Then we define executable RLP decoders for trees, bytes, and scalars 
     based on the parser. 
     These decoders return an error 
     if there are extra bytes after the encodings. 
     We prove these decoders equivalent to the 
     <a href="ETHEREUM____RLP-DECODING-DECLARATIVE.html">declaratively defined 
     ones</a>, 
     using the left and right inverse properties of the parser.</p><p>While the declaratively defined decoders return a boolean error result, 
     which therefore conveys a single kind of error, 
     the executable parser and decoders return more detailed error information. 
     Thus, the equivalence relation for the error result 
     of the declaratively defined decoders and of the executable ones 
     is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a></span> instead of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>; see the theorems.</p>
