<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____STD_F2STRINGS">Click for Std/strings in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A library with many useful functions for working with strings, and 
for reasoning about ACL2's built-in string operations and these new 
operations.</p><p>The <span class="v">std/strings</span> library is a rudimentary string library for 
ACL2.  The functions here are all in logic mode, with verified guards.  In many 
cases, some effort has been spent to make them both efficient and relatively 
straightforward to reason about.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Loading the library</h3> 
 
<p><b>Note:</b> All of the library's functions are found in the <span class="v">STR</span> 
package.</p> 
 
<p>Ordinarily, to use the library one should run</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "std/strings/top" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>To keep the top book more lightweight, certain functionality is excluded by 
default.  Here are additional books you may want to include:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">std/strings/base64</span> — support for <a href="STR____BASE64.html">base64</a> encoding/decoding</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">std/strings/pretty</span> — support for <a href="STR____PRETTY-PRINTING.html">pretty-printing</a> ACL2 expressions</li> 
</ul> 
 
<h5>Advanced Options</h5> 
 
<p>If you are willing to accept a trust tag, you may also include the 
<span class="v">fast-cat</span> book for faster string-concatenation; see <a href="STR____CAT.html">cat</a> for 
details.</p> 
 
<p>If you only need some subset of the available functions, it's generally 
reasonable to just include individual books instead of the <span class="v">top</span> book. 
However, book names and dependencies do sometimes change, so in general we 
recommend just loading the <span class="v">top</span> book.</p> 
 
<p>If you want to be able to use the string operations but don't have any need 
to reason about them, e.g., because you are writing code for macros, then you 
might instead want to load either:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">std/strings/defs</span> — logic mode definitions, minimal theorems</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">std/strings/defs-program</span> — program mode definitions, no theorems</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>These books may load slightly faster than the <span class="v">top</span> book and may help to 
minimize the effects of loading the library on your theory.</p>
