<p>Functions that extend the logic</p><p>Any extension of the syntax of ACL2 (i.e., the definition of a new 
 constant or macro), the axioms (i.e., the definition of a function), or the 
 rule database (i.e., the proof of a theorem), constitutes a logical ``event.'' 
 Events change the ACL2 logical world (see <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>).  Indeed, the only way 
 to change the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> is via the successful evaluation of an event 
 function.  Every time the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> is changed by an event, a landmark is 
 left on the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and it is thus possible to identify the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> 
 ``as of'' the evaluation of a given event.  An event may introduce new logical 
 names.  Some events introduce no new names (e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span>), some 
 introduce exactly one (e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>), and some 
 may introduce many (e.g., <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> ).</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 typically completes processing of an event by printing a <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>.  Unless proofs are skipped (see <a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a>) or summary 
 output is inhibited (see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a>), information about the 
 proof attempt (if any) is printed that includes a list of rules used, a 
 summary of warnings, and the number of ``prover steps'' (if any; see <a href="ACL2____WITH-PROVER-STEP-LIMIT.html">with-prover-step-limit</a>).  A breakdown of the time used is also printed, which 
 by default is runtime (cpu time), but can be changed to realtime (wall clock 
 time); see <a href="ACL2____GET-INTERNAL-TIME.html">get-internal-time</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____EMBEDDED-EVENT-FORM.html">embedded-event-form</a> for a discussion of events permitted in 
 <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>.</p>
