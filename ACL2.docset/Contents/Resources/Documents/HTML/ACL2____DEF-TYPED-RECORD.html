<p>Introduce a typed record for use with <a href="ACL2____DEFRSTOBJ.html">defrstobj</a>.</p><p>A <b>typed record</b> is a record-like structure: it associates 
keys with values, has a <span class="v">get</span> function to look up the value of some key, and 
has a <span class="v">set</span> function to install some new value for some key.</p> 
 
<p>Unlike an ordinary <span class="v">misc/record</span>, a typed record is homogeneous, i.e., we 
unconditionally know: <pre class="code">(foop (get a r))</pre>  Meanwhile, the <span class="v">get</span> and 
<span class="v">set</span> functions for a typed record are <b>almost</b> the same as for 
ordinary records.  The only difference is that the <span class="v">g-same-s</span> theorem 
becomes:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(get a (set a v r)) = (foo-fix v)   ; instead of just being v</pre> 
 
<p>The macro <span class="v">def-typed-record</span> can be used to introduce a new typed record 
structure for use in <a href="ACL2____DEFRSTOBJ.html">defrstobj</a> array fields.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Usage</h3> 
 
<p>You can use <span class="v">def-typed-record</span> to introduce the <span class="v">get-</span> and <span class="v">set-</span> 
functions, the ordinary <span class="v">get-of-set</span> style theorems about them, and some 
additional definitions such as a badguy for identifying differences between 
typed records (which can be useful for pick-a-point style reasoning.)</p> 
 
<h5>Example: typed record for naturals</h5> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-TYPED-RECORD.html">def-typed-record</a> nat
  :elem-p (<a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a> x)
  :elem-list-p (<a href="ACL2____NAT-LISTP.html">nat-listp</a> x)
  :elem-default 0
  :elem-fix (<a href="ACL2____NFIX.html">nfix</a> x))</pre> 
 
<p>This introduces the recognizer function <span class="v">nat-tr-p</span>, the getter function 
<span class="v">nat-tr-get</span>, the setter function <span class="v">nat-tr-set</span>, and related theorems.</p> 
 
<h5>Example: typed-record for (8-bit) bytes</h5> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> ubp-listp (n x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> x)
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> x)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> n (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))
         (ubp-listp n (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)))))

(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> ubp-fix (n x)            ;; other fixing functions
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))    ;; are also possible
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> n x)
      x
    0))

(<a href="ACL2____DEF-TYPED-RECORD.html">def-typed-record</a> ubp8
  :elem-p       (<a href="ACL2____UNSIGNED-BYTE-P.html">unsigned-byte-p</a> 8 x)
  :elem-list-p  (ubp-listp 8 x)
  :elem-default 0
  :elem-fix     (ubp-fix 8 x))</pre> 
 
<p>This produce <span class="v">ubp8-tr-p</span>, <span class="v">ubp8-tr-get</span>, <span class="v">ubp8-tr-set</span>, and related 
theorems.</p> 
 
 
<h5>General Form</h5> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-TYPED-RECORD.html">def-typed-record</a> name
  :elem-p        [element recognizer, foop]
  :elem-list-p   [list recognizer, foo-listp]
  :elem-default  [default value, e.g., 0, nil, ...]
  :elem-fix      [fixing function, foo-fix]
  :in-package-of [symbol to use for new names])</pre> 
 
<p>Note that the terms you use for <span class="v">elem-p</span> and so forth need to refer to 
exactly the variable <span class="v">acl2::x</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Related Work and History</h3> 
 
<p>This version of typed records is very similar in spirit to the 
<span class="v">coi/records/defrecord.lisp</span> book; see:</p> 
 
<div class="box"><p>David Greve and Matthew Wilding.  <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2003/contrib/greve-wilding_defrecord/defrecord.ps" target="_blank"><nobr>Typed 
ACL2 Records<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/workshop-2003/contrib/greve-wilding_defrecord/defrecord.ps"></nobr></a>. ACL2 Workshop 2003.</p></div> 
 
<p>Greve and Wilding implemented typed records by starting with an ordinary 
record, but instead of just storing values or fixed values into its slots, they 
instead store ENTRIES of the form <span class="v">(FOO . NON-ENTRY)</span>, where the FOO must be 
a foop that is not the default foop.</p> 
 
<p>When developing rstobjs, I (Jared) started with Greve and Wilding's 
approach; see <a href="ACL2____LEGACY-DEFRSTOBJ.html">legacy-defrstobj</a>.  But when I tried to extend their work 
to be able to view a STOBJ array as a typed record, I ran into trouble.  I 
didn't see a good way to prove something akin to <span class="v">equal-by-g</span>, and without 
that it didn't seem easy to adapt the basic approach I'd developed for untyped 
records to also deal with typed records.</p> 
 
<p>I went to Sol's office to gripe about this, and we started to try to more 
precisely understand what was problematic.  In a short time, we had come up 
with a different way to implement typed records that seems to be much more 
suitable.</p> 
 
<p>In short, instead of using a <span class="v">misc/record</span> with some kind of special 
entries, we directly develop a new kind of typed record where the well-formed 
records are only allowed to have values of the proper type.  This lets us 
nicely separate the bad part of the record (if any) from the good part, and 
obtain a theorem in the spirit of <span class="v">EQUAL-BY-G</span>.</p>
