 <h5>Contributors to the x86 ISA Model</h5> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Rob Sumners for adding support for detecting decode-time 
 exceptions.</p> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Alessandro Coglio (Kestrel Institute and Kestrel Technology LLC) 
 for adding support for 32-bit mode and for improving the documentation of 
 these books.</p> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Cuong Kim Chau for implementing the floating point 
 instructions and for performing many experiments (along with Keshav 
 Kini) to figure out an efficient configuration for the concrete 
 memory model.</p> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Soumava Ghosh for his work on supporting the execution of 
 system calls and the ELF loader functions.</p> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Keshav Kini for answering all sorts of git-related 
 questions and for performing many experiments (along with Cuong Kim 
 Chau) to figure out an efficient configuration for the concrete 
 memory model.</p> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Robert Krug for carrying out countless arithmetic proofs, 
 and for the initial specification of the paging mechanism and proofs 
 about properties of paging data structures.</p> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Ben Selfridge for putting in type declarations and 
 resolving the resulting guard proof obligations about the paging 
 specification functions.</p>
