<p>The condition in which function definitions are elsewhere, 
          applied to entities in the dynamic semntics.</p><p>We extend the <span class="v">...-nofunp</span> predicates 
     defined in <a href="YUL____NO-FUNCTION-DEFINITIONS.html">no-function-definitions</a> 
     to some of the dynamic semantics entities. 
     This extension serves to take advantage of this condition 
     in proofs of dynamic correctness of transformations 
     that assume that the code satisfies the condition. 
     In fact, we prove theorems that are used in such proofs.</p>
