<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____SNEAKY">Click for Sneaky in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>A debugging tool for ACL2 programs.  The sneaky functions allow you 
to save and mutate global variables, even without access to <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>.</p><h3>Introductory example</h3> 
 
<pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt; (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> my-function (x y)           ;; note: no state
          (<a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> ((sum     (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x y))
               (product (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> x y)))
            (<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-SAVE.html">sneaky-save</a> :sum sum)         ; save the latest sum
            (<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-SAVE.html">sneaky-save</a> :product product) ; save the latest product
            (<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-INCF.html">sneaky-incf</a> :calls 1)         ; count how many calls there were
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> sum product)))

ACL2 !&gt; (my-function 1 2)
(3 2)

ACL2 !&gt; (my-function 3 4)
(7 12)

ACL2 !&gt; (<a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a> (*sum* state)           ;; *sum* is 7
          (<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-LOAD.html">sneaky-load</a> :sum state))        ;; (its most recent value)

ACL2 !&gt; (<a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a> (*product* state)       ;; *product* is 7
          (<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-LOAD.html">sneaky-load</a> :product state))    ;; (its most recent value)

ACL2 !&gt; (<a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a> (*calls* state)         ;; *calls* is 2
          (<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-LOAD.html">sneaky-load</a> :product state))    ;; (we called my-function twice)</pre> 
 
<h3>Motivation</h3> 
 
<p>When you are debugging a large program, you may want to get a hold of 
internal values from some function that is somehow "deep" inside your 
computation.  Here are some ways you might do this:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Printing.  You could, perhaps via <a href="ACL2____REDEF.html">redef</a>, add <a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> statements to 
print out the desired values. This is easy and works well when your values are 
small enough to print, and your function is called infrequently enough that the 
printing is not unmanageable.</li> 
 
<li>Tracing.  If the values you want to see are inputs or outputs of a 
function, you could perhaps use <a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a>.  This may avoid needing to 
rebuild or use <a href="ACL2____REDEF.html">redef</a>.  Like printing, this is likely to work well for 
inspecting small values and infrequently called functions.</li> 
 
<li>Globals.  If your functions involves <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, you might be able to 
just <a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> the values of interest to some new state globals.  You could 
then extract and inspect them using <a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>.  This approach may work well even 
for large values or frequently called functions, but requires access to 
state.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>Unfortunately, if your program is made up of ordinary, pure ACL2 functions 
that do not involve <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>, then using globals might require adding state 
all throughout the call tree.  This could be really difficult, especially for a 
one-off investigation.</p> 
 
<p>The <b>sneaky</b> mechanism allows you to work around this limitation: it is 
very similar to using globals, but allows you to avoid state.</p> 
 
<h3>Implementation</h3> 
 
<p>The sneaky book requires a trust tag.  In raw Lisp, we add a Common Lisp 
variable, the <span class="v">*sneaky-state*</span>, which is a hash table associating names with 
values.</p> 
 
<p>The main sneaky operations, like <a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-SAVE.html">sneaky-save</a>, <a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-PUSH.html">sneaky-push</a>, and 
<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-INCF.html">sneaky-incf</a>, allow you to manipulate the values in this hash table, but 
only indirectly.  This keeps the <span class="v">*sneaky-state*</span> as a purely Common Lisp 
variable that exists outside of ACL2, so the effects of manipulating this state 
is logically invisible.  That is, in the logic, all of these functions just 
return <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
<p>Meanwhile, to be able to retrieve values, the special operations <a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-LOAD.html">sneaky-load</a> and <a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-ALIST.html">sneaky-alist</a> allow you to access the 
<span class="v">*sneaky-state*</span>.  However, in the logic these functions just read from the 
ACL2 oracle.  So, even though a sequence like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-SAVE.html">sneaky-save</a> :foo 5)
(<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-LOAD.html">sneaky-load</a> :foo state)   ;; should always return (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> '5 state)</pre> 
 
<p>There is no logical connection between the sneaky save/load, so you should 
never be able to prove theorems such as</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> unprovable
  (<a href="ACL2____PROGN_42.html">progn$</a> (<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-SAVE.html">sneaky-save</a> :foo 5)
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 0 (<a href="ACL2____SNEAKY-LOAD.html">sneaky-load</a> :foo state)) 5)))</pre>
