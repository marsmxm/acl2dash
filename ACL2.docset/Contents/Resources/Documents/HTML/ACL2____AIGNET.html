<p>An efficient, <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>-based And-Inverter Graph (AIG) 
representation for Boolean functions and finite-state machines.</p><h3>Background</h3> 
 
<p>At its most basic, an AIG is a DAG whose nodes are either AND/XOR gates, 
outputs, inputs, or the unique constant node.  Outputs have 1 
descendant (fanin), ANDs/XORs have 2, and inputs have none.  An edge may point 
to gate, input, or constant, but not an output; we call gates, inputs, and 
constants collectively "fanin nodes".  Each edge has a Boolean attribute 
signifying whether it is negated or not--thus we need only one constant node instead of one true and one false. 
Such an AIG is <b>combinational</b>: 
it represents a stateless circuit that produces outputs that are Boolean 
functions of its inputs.</p> 
 
<p>A <b>sequential</b> AIG extends this to directly model circuits with 
internal state that responds to inputs that are changing over time.  Here the 
combinational input and outputs to the AIG are divided into two categories:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<font color="#0000ff">Combinational inputs</font> = primary inputs + registers</li> 
<li>
<font color="#ff0000">Combinational outputs</font> = primary outputs + register next-states</li> 
</ul>

<p>The sequential semantics for an AIG depend on an initial 
state and a series of inputs:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Initially, assign initial values to the register next-states.</li> 
 
<li>Every cycle: 
 
   <ul> 
    <li>copy values from next-states to corresponding registers</li> 
    <li>assign values to the primary inputs</li> 
    <li>compute values of gates in topological order</li> 
    <li>compute values of primary outputs and next states.</li> 
   </ul>
</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h3>The Aignet Library</h3> 
 
<p>The Aignet library, found in <span class="v">centaur/aignet</span>, is intended to provide an 
<b>efficient</b> implementation of sequential AIGs.</p> 
 
<p>We represent an AIG network as an <a href="ACL2____ABSTRACT-STOBJ.html">abstract-stobj</a>.  This means that 
the Common Lisp implementation and its logical story are substantially 
different.  This is true of concrete stobjs as well, where access/update 
functions are logically defined in terms of <a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> and <a href="ACL2____UPDATE-NTH.html">update-nth</a> 
but implemented as array accesses.  But it is especially true for Aignet!</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Logically—for reasoning about the AIG network and proving AIG 
algorithms are correct—the AIG network is viewed as just a list of 
<i>nodes</i>.  Understanding these definitions is a first step toward 
successfully using Aignet; see <a href="AIGNET____REPRESENTATION.html">representation</a>.</li> 
 
<li>For execution, the AIG is actually represented with various <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> 
arrays, largely styled after the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/" target="_blank"><nobr>ABC<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/"></nobr></a> package.  Since the 
implementation is kept hidden, most users can feel free to skim or entirely 
skip the details in <a href="AIGNET____AIGNET-IMPL.html">aignet-impl</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>The low-level <a href="AIGNET____BASE-API.html">base-api</a> connects these logical and executable 
definitions together, and provides the most basic operations for initializing 
the network, adding nodes to it, inspecting the contents of the nodes, and so 
on.  The rest of Aignet is built on top of this API.  Generally speaking, 
accesses are implemented as constant-time, and updates as amortized 
constant-time (since there may be array resizes).</p>

<h3>Comparison with Hons-AIGs</h3> 
 
<p>Our focus on efficiency makes Aignet more difficult to work with and reason 
about than the simpler <a href="ACL2____AIG.html">Hons-AIG library</a>. 
On the other hand, Aignet can sometimes be much faster than Hons-AIGs.  For a 
good introduction with a more detailed comparison of Hons-AIGs and Aignet,
