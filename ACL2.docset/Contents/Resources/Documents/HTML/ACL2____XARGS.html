<p>Extra arguments, for example to give <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span></p><p>Common Lisp's <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> function does not easily allow one to 
 pass extra arguments such as ``<a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>''.  ACL2 therefore supports a 
 peculiar new declaration (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>) designed explicitly for passing 
 additional arguments to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> via a keyword-like syntax.  This 
 declaration can also be used with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a></span>, but only for <span class="v">xargs</span> 
 keyword <span class="v">:guard</span>; so we restrict attention below to use of <span class="v">xargs</span> in 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The following declaration is nonsensical but does illustrate all of the 
 <span class="v">xargs</span> keywords for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> (which are the members of the list 
 <span class="v">*xargs-keywords*</span>).</p>

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :key1 val1 ... :keyn valn)</pre> 
 
 <p>where the keywords and their respective values are as shown below.  Note 
 that once ``inside'' the xargs form, the ``extra arguments'' to <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> 
 are passed exactly as though they were keyword arguments.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:guard</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is a term involving only the formals of the function being defined. 
 The actual <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> used for the definition is the conjunction of all the 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s and types declared, in the order lexically given, preceded by 
 conjuncts corresponding to the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span> declarations (if any, and 
 including <span class="v">(state-p state)</span> if <span class="v">state</span> is a formal).  Also see <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>.<br>Note that if no <span class="v">:guard</span> is specified explicitly, then a 
 guard of <span class="v">t</span> is assumed, as though one had declared <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard
 t)</span>.  (Note that <span class="v">t</span> is indeed a term involving only the formals; it 
 specifies that the guard requirement is always met.)  However, by default, a 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode function definition will not attempt to verify guards 
 unless an explicit <span class="v">xargs</span> <span class="v">:guard</span> declaration is provided.  For 
 details on this point, as well as how to change that default behavior, see 
 <a href="ACL2____SET-VERIFY-GUARDS-EAGERNESS.html">set-verify-guards-eagerness</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:guard-debug</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span>: <span class="v">nil</span> by default, else directs ACL2 to decorate each guard 
 proof obligation with hypotheses indicating its sources.  See <a href="ACL2____GUARD-DEBUG.html">guard-debug</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:guard-hints</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span>: hints (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>), to be used during the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> 
 verification proofs as opposed to the termination proofs of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:guard-simplify</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span>: <span class="v">t</span> by default, which supports simplification performed while 
 generating the guard proof obligation.  The value can also be <span class="v">:limited</span>, 
 which directs ACL2 to skip such simplification that depends on which rules are 
 currently <a href="ACL2____ENABLE.html">enable</a>d.  This has the same effect as the corresponding 
 keyword argument to <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span>.  Also see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-SIMPLIFICATION.html">guard-simplification</a> and <a href="ACL2____GUARD-FORMULA-UTILITIES.html">guard-formula-utilities</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a></span><br> 
 
 Value: hints (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>), to be used during the termination proofs as 
 opposed to the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> verification proofs of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42-RECURSION.html">loop$-recursion</a></span><br> 
 
 Value: this flag must be set to <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>; <span class="v">nil</span> is the default. 
 The flag must be <span class="v">t</span> if and only if the function being defined calls itself 
 recursively from within a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP_42.html">loop$</a></span> body or within a <span class="v">when</span> or 
 <span class="v">until</span> clause.  See <a href="ACL2____LOOP_42-RECURSION.html">loop$-recursion</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:measure</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is a term involving only the formals of the function being defined. 
 This term indicates what is getting smaller in the recursion.  The 
 well-founded relation with which successive measures are compared is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O_C3.html">o&lt;</a></span> by default, but can be changed using the <span class="v">:well-founded-relation</span> 
 keyword or with the <a href="ACL2____SET-WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION.html">set-well-founded-relation</a> event.  Also allowed is a 
 special case, <span class="v">(:? v1 ... vk)</span>, where <span class="v">(v1 ... vk)</span> enumerates a subset 
 of the formal parameters such that some valid measure involves only those 
 formal parameters.  However, this special case is only allowed for definitions 
 that are redundant (see <a href="ACL2____REDUNDANT-EVENTS.html">redundant-events</a>) or are executed when skipping 
 proofs (see <a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a>).  Another special case is <span class="v">:measure nil</span>, 
 which is treated the same as if <span class="v">:measure</span> is omitted.  Note that a 
 <span class="v">:measure</span> is not allowed for a non-recursive definition (other than the 
 ``measure'' <span class="v">nil</span>) unless the definition is part of a <a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a>; 
 moreover, if a <span class="v">:measure</span> is supplied, then it must be a legal term. Apart 
 from these restrictions, the <span class="v">:measure</span> is ignored in <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> mode; see 
 <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:measure-debug</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span>: <span class="v">nil</span> by default, else directs ACL2 to decorate each 
 termination proof obligation with hypotheses indicating its sources.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____MEASURE-DEBUG.html">measure-debug</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:mode</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> or <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>, indicating the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> mode of the function introduced.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-MODE.html">defun-mode</a>.  If 
 unspecified, the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> mode defaults to the default <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> mode 
 of the current <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>.  To convert a function from <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> 
 mode to <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode, see <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-TERMINATION.html">verify-termination</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:non-executable</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is normally <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span> (the default).  Rather than stating 
 <span class="v">:non-executable t</span> directly, which requires <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode and 
 that the definitional body has a certain form, we suggest using the macro 
 <span class="v">defun-nx</span> or <span class="v">defund-nx</span>; see <a href="ACL2____DEFUN-NX.html">defun-nx</a>.  A third value of 
 <span class="v">:non-executable</span> for advanced users is <span class="v">:program</span>, which is generated 
 by expansion of <span class="v">defproxy</span> forms; see <a href="ACL2____DEFPROXY.html">defproxy</a>.  For another way to 
 deal with non-executability, see <a href="ACL2____NON-EXEC.html">non-exec</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:normalize</span><br> 
 
 Value is a flag telling <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> whether to perform certain 
 simplification before storing the body of the function; see <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZE.html">normalize</a>. 
 Since the default is to do such <a href="ACL2____NORMALIZATION.html">normalization</a>, the value supplied is 
 only of interest when it is <span class="v">nil</span>.  (See <a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a>).</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a></span><br> 
 
 Value is a flag indicating ``onward through the fog'' 
 (see <a href="ACL2____OTF-FLG.html">otf-flg</a>).  It applies to the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> verification, as it is 
 effectively <span class="v">t</span> during the termination proof.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:ruler-extenders</span><br> 
 
 For recursive definitions (possibly mutually recursive), <span class="v">value</span> controls 
 termination analysis and the resulting stored induction scheme.  See <a href="ACL2____RULERS.html">rulers</a> for a discussion of legal values and their effects.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="v">split-types</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>, indicating whether or not <a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">type</a>s are 
 to be proved from the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s.  The default is <span class="v">nil</span>, indicating that 
 type declarations (see <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a>) contribute to the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s.  If 
 the value is <span class="v">t</span>, then instead, the expressions corresponding to the type 
 declarations (see <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SPEC.html">type-spec</a>) are conjoined into a ``split-type 
 expression,'' and guard verification insists that this term is implied by the 
 specified <span class="v">:guard</span>.  Suppose for example that a definition has the 
 following <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a></span> form.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (p x y) :split-types t)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">type</a> integer x)
         (<a href="COMMON-LISP____TYPE.html">type</a> (satisfies good-bar-p) y))</pre> 
 
 <p>Then for guard verification, <span class="v">(p x y)</span> is assumed, and in addition to 
 the usual proof obligations derived from the body of the definition, guard 
 verification requires a proof that <span class="v">(p x y)</span> implies both <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGERP.html">integerp</a> x)</span> 
 and <span class="v">(good-bar-p y)</span>.  See community book 
 <span class="v">demos/split-types-examples.lisp</span> for small examples.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:stobjs</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is either a single <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a></span> name or a true list of stobj names 
 (see <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DEFSTOBJ.html">defstobj</a>, and perhaps see <a href="ACL2____DEFABSSTOBJ.html">defabsstobj</a>).  Every stobj name among the formals of the function must be 
 listed, if the corresponding actual is to be treated as a stobj.  That is, if 
 a function uses a stobj name as a formal parameter but the name is not 
 declared among the <span class="v">:stobjs</span> then the corresponding argument is treated as 
 ordinary.  The only exception to this rule is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>: whether you 
 include it or not, <span class="v">state</span> is always treated as a single-threaded object. 
 This declaration has two effects.  One is to enforce the syntactic 
 restrictions on single-threaded objects.  The other is to strengthen the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a></span> of the function being defined so that it includes conjuncts 
 specifying that each declared single-threaded object argument satisfies the 
 recognizer for the corresponding single-threaded object.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:type-prescription</span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is either <span class="v">nil</span> (the default) or a formula that is suitable for 
 a hypothesis-free <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a></span> rule.  That rule must be 
 appropriate for the <span class="v">:typed-term</span> that is the application of the defined 
 function symbol to its formal parameters.  For example, a legal value for 
 <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> in <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x y) ...)</span> could be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (f
 x y)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f x y) y))</span>, but not <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____OR.html">or</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (f u v)) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (f u v)
 v))</span>.  The specified formula must provide a type that is implied by the 
 built-in type that is computed for the defined function.  Normally these will 
 be equal, but if the value of <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> specifies a strictly 
 weaker type than the computed built-in type then a warning will be printed 
 (unless of course such warnings have been suppressed; see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a> and <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a>).  It is an error to 
 supply a non-<span class="v">nil</span> value for <span class="v">:type-prescription</span> if there is no 
 built-in type computed for the function.  See also <a href="ACL2____TYPE-PRESCRIPTION.html">type-prescription</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is <span class="v">t</span> or <span class="v">nil</span>, indicating whether or not <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s are 
 to be verified upon completion of the termination proof.  This flag should 
 only be <span class="v">t</span> if the <span class="v">:mode</span> is unspecified but the default <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> 
 mode is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>, or else the <span class="v">:mode</span> is <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION.html">well-founded-relation</a></span><br> 
 
 <span class="v">Value</span> is a function symbol that is known to be a well-founded relation in 
 the sense that a rule of class <span class="v">:well-founded-relation</span> has been proved 
 about it.  The effect is to replace the default well-founded relation, which 
 is typically <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____O_C3.html">o&lt;</a></span>, by the specified value.  See <a href="ACL2____WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION-RULE.html">well-founded-relation-rule</a> and see <a href="ACL2____SET-WELL-FOUNDED-RELATION.html">set-well-founded-relation</a> for 
 further discussion, including how to change the default 
 well-founded-relation.</p>
