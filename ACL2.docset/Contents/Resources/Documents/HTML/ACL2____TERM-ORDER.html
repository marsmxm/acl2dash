<p>The ordering relation on terms used by ACL2</p><p>ACL2 must occasionally choose which of two terms is syntactically 
 smaller.  The need for such a choice arises, for example, when using equality 
 hypotheses in conjectures (the smaller term is substituted for the larger 
 elsewhere in the formula), in stopping loops in permutative rewrite rules 
 (see <a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a>), and in choosing the order in which to try to cancel 
 the addends in linear arithmetic inequalities.  When this notion of syntactic 
 size is needed, ACL2 uses ``term order.''  Popularly speaking, term order is 
 just a lexicographic ordering on terms.  But the situation is actually more 
 complicated.</p> 
 
 <p>We define term order only with respect to terms in translated form.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____TRANS.html">trans</a>.  Constants are viewed as built up by <i>pseudo-function</i> 
 applications, as described at the end of this documentation.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Term1</span> comes before <span class="v">term2</span> in the term order iff</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>(a) the number of variable occurrences in <span class="v">term1</span> is less than that in 
 <span class="v">term2</span>, or</p> 
 
 <p>(b) the numbers of variable occurrences in the two terms are equal but the 
 number of function applications in <span class="v">term1</span> is less than that in <span class="v">term2</span>, 
 or</p> 
 
 <p>(c) the numbers of variable occurrences in the two terms are equal, the 
 numbers of functions applications in the two terms are equal, but 
 pseudo-function application count for <span class="v">term1</span> is less than that for 
 <span class="v">term2</span>, or</p> 
 
 <p>(d) the numbers of variable occurrences in the two terms are equal, the 
 numbers of functions applications in the two terms are equal, the 
 pseudo-function application counts for the two terms are equal, and <span class="v">term1</span> 
 comes before <span class="v">term2</span> in a lexicographic ordering, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LEXORDER.html">lexorder</a></span>, based 
 their structure as Lisp objects: see <a href="ACL2____LEXORDER.html">lexorder</a>.</p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>The function <span class="v">term-order</span>, when applied to the translations of two ACL2 
 terms, returns <span class="v">t</span> iff the first is ``less than or equal'' to the second in 
 the term order.</p> 
 
 <p>By ``number of variable occurrences'' we do not mean ``number of distinct 
 variables'' but ``number of times a variable symbol is mentioned.''  <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">Cons</a>
 x x)</span> has two variable occurrences, not one.  Thus, perhaps 
 counterintuitively, a large term that contains only one variable occurrence, 
 e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____STANDARD-CHAR-P.html">standard-char-p</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> x)))</span> comes before <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x x)</span> in 
 the term order.</p> 
 
 <p>Since constants contain no variable occurrences and non-constant 
 expressions must contain at least one variable occurrence, constants come 
 before non-constants in the term order, no matter how large the constants. 
 For example, the list constant</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">'(monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday)</pre> 
 
 <p>comes before <span class="v">x</span> in the term order.  Because term order is involved in 
 the control of permutative rewrite rules and used to shift smaller terms to 
 the left, a set of permutative rules designed to allow the permutation of any 
 two tips in a tree representing the nested application of some function will 
 always move the constants into the left-most tips.  Thus,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> x 3 (dx i j) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> klst))) ,</pre> 
 
 <p>which in translated form is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a> x
          (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a> '3
                    (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a> (dx i j)
                              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> klst))))),</pre> 
 
 <p>will be permuted under the built-in commutativity rules to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a> '3
          (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a> x
                    (<a href="ACL2____BINARY-_B2.html">binary-+</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> klst))
                              (dx i j))))</pre> 
 
 <p>or</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 3 x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> klst)) (dx i j)).</pre> 
 
 <p>Two terms with the same numbers of variable occurrences and function 
 applications and the same pseudo-function application count are ordered by 
 lexicographic means, based on their structures.  See <a href="ACL2____LEXORDER.html">lexorder</a>.  Thus, 
 if two terms <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> ...)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a> ...)</span> contain the same numbers 
 of variable occurrences and function applications, and no quoted constants, 
 then the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a></span> term is first in the term order because <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a></span> 
 comes before <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____REVERSE.html">reverse</a></span> in the term order (which is here reduced to 
 alphabetic ordering).</p> 
 
 <p>It remains to discuss the notion of <i>pseudo-function application 
 count</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>Clearly, two constants are ordered using cases (c) and (d) of term order, 
 since they each contain 0 variable occurrences and no function calls.  This 
 raises the question ``How many function applications are in a constant?'' 
 Because we regard the number of function applications as a more fundamental 
 measure of the size of a constant than lexicographic considerations, we 
 decided that for the purposes of term order, constants would be seen as being 
 built by primitive constructor functions.  These constructor functions are not 
 actually defined in ACL2 but merely imagined for the purposes of term order. 
 We here use suggestive names for these imagined functions, ignoring entirely 
 the prior use of these names within ACL2.  The imagined applications of these 
 functions are what we refer to as <i>pseudo-function</i> applications.</p> 
 
 <p>The constant function <span class="v">z</span> constructs <span class="v">0</span>.  Positive integers are 
 constructed from <span class="v">(z)</span> by the successor function, <span class="v">s</span>.  Thus <span class="v">2</span> is 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> (<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> (z)))</span> and contains three function applications.  <span class="v">100</span> contains 
 one hundred and one applications.  Negative integers are constructed from 
 their positive counterparts by <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a></span>.  Thus, <span class="v">-2</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> (<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> (<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a>
 (z))))</span> and has four applications.  Ratios are constructed by the dyadic 
 function <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____F2.html">/</a></span>.  Thus, <span class="v">-1/2</span> is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____F2.html">/</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____-.html">-</a> (<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> (z))) (<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> (<a href="ACL2____S.html">s</a> (z))))</pre> 
 
 <p>and contains seven applications.  Complex rationals are similarly 
 constructed from rationals.  All character objects are considered primitive 
 and are constructed by constant functions of the same name.  Thus <span class="v">#\a</span> 
 and <span class="v">#\b</span> both contain one application.  Strings are built from the empty 
 string, <span class="v">(o)</span> by the ``string-cons'' function written <span class="v">cs</span>.  Thus 
 <span class="v">"AB"</span> is <span class="v">(cs (#\a) (cs (#\b) (o)))</span> and contains five 
 applications.  Symbols are obtained from strings by ``packing'' the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> with the unary function <span class="v">p</span>.  Thus <span class="v">'ab</span> is</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(p (cs (#\a) (cs (#\b) (o))))</pre> 
 
 <p>and has six applications.  Note that packages are here ignored and thus 
 <span class="v">'acl2::ab</span> and <span class="v">'my-package::ab</span> each contain just six applications. 
 Finally, <a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a>es are built with <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a></span>, as usual.  So <span class="v">'(1
 . 2)</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> '1 '2)</span> and contains six applications, since <span class="v">'1</span> 
 contains two and <span class="v">'2</span> contains three.  This, for better or worse, answers 
 the question ``How many function applications are in a constant?''</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, when we refer to the ``pseudo-function application count'', we 
 mean the number of pseudo-function applications as described above, except 
 that we bound this number by the constant <span class="v">(fn-count-evg-max-val)</span>.  (This 
 bound is important for efficiency, so that constants that are very large 
 <span class="v">cons</span> structures do not cause significant slowdown as ACL2 attempts to 
 walk through them while computing their pseudo-function application 
 count.)</p>
