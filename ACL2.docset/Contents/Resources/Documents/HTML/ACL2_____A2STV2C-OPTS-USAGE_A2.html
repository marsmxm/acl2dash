<p>Automatically generated usage message.</p><pre class="code">    -h,--help             Show a brief usage message and exit. 
-r,--readme           Show a more elaborate README message and 
                      exit. 
--stv=FILE            The symbolic test vector that will be used to 
                      run the module. 
-s,--search=DIR       Search path for finding modules.  You can 
                      give this switch multiple times, to set up 
                      multiple search paths in priority order. 
--searchext=EXT       Control the search extensions for finding 
                      modules.  You can give this switch multiple 
                      times.  By default we just look for files 
                      named "foo.v" in the --search directories. 
                      But if you have Verilog files with different 
                      extensions, this won't work, so you can add 
                      these extensions here.  EXT should not 
                      include the period, e.g., use "--searchext 
                      vv" to consider files like "foo.vv", etc. 
-D,--define=VAR       Set up definitions to use before parsing 
                      begins.  Equivalent to putting `define VAR 1 
                      at the top of your Verilog file.  You can 
                      give this option multiple times. 
--edition=EDITION     Which edition of the Verilog standard to 
                      implement?  Default: "SystemVerilog" (IEEE 
                      1800-2012).  You can alternately use 
                      "Verilog" for IEEE 1364-2005, i.e., 
                      Verilog-2005. 
--strict              Disable VL extensions to Verilog. 
-m,--mem=GB           How much memory to try to use.  Default: 4 
                      GB.  Raising this may improve performance by 
                      avoiding garbage collection.  To avoid 
                      swapping, keep this below (physical_memory - 
                      2 GB).
