<p>Hide a term from the rewriter</p><p><span class="v">Hide</span> is actually the <a href="COMMON-LISP____IDENTITY.html">identity</a> function: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> x) =
 x</span> for all <span class="v">x</span>.  However, terms of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> x)</span> are ignored by 
 the ACL2 rewriter, except when explicit <span class="v">:expand</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a> are given 
 for such terms (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>) or when rewrite rules explicitly about 
 <span class="v">hide</span> are available.  An <span class="v">:expand</span> hint that removes all calls of 
 <span class="v">hide</span> is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:expand ((:free (x) (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The above hint can be particularly useful when ACL2's equality heuristics 
 apply <span class="v">hide</span> to an equality after substituting it into the rest of the 
 goal, if that goal (or a subgoal of it) fails to be proved.</p> 
 
 <p>Another common case, described below, is when <span class="v">hide</span> is added by the 
 simplifier because an attempted execution of the term failed.  In this case, 
 an <span class="v">:expand</span> hint as described above will have no effect because the 
 execution will just fail again; the <span class="v">hide</span> will be re-inserted; and the 
 hapless user will find themselves questioning their own sanity.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Hide</span> terms are generally ignored not only by the rewriter but by other 
 ACL2 procedures, including the induction heuristics and (by default) removal 
 of <a href="ACL2____GUARD-HOLDERS.html">guard-holders</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Sometimes the ACL2 simplifier inserts <span class="v">hide</span> terms into a proof attempt 
 out of the blue, as it were.  Why and what can you do about it?  Suppose you 
 have a constrained function, say <span class="v">constrained-fn</span>, and you define another 
 function, say <span class="v">another-fn</span>, in terms of it, as in:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> another-fn (x y z)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (big-hairy-test x y z)
      (constrained-fn x y z)
      t))</pre> 
 
 <p>Suppose the term <span class="v">(another-fn 1 2 3)</span> arises in a proof.  Since the 
 arguments are all constants, ACL2 may try to reduce such a term to a constant 
 by executing the definition of <span class="v">another-fn</span>.  However, after a possibly 
 extensive computation (because of <span class="v">big-hairy-test</span>) the execution fails 
 because of the unevaluable call of <span class="v">constrained-fn</span>.  To avoid subsequent 
 attempts to evaluate the term, ACL2 embeds it in a <span class="v">hide</span> expression. 
 Often that expression will use a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a></span>, where <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> x
 y)</span> is logically just <span class="v">y</span>, to tell you the problematic constrained 
 function, in this case by rewriting the original expression to the following; 
 see <a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a>.  (Near the end of this topic we discuss how to avoid the 
 call of <span class="v">comment</span>.)</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> "Failed attempt to call constrained function CONSTRAINED-FN"
               (another-fn 1 2 3)))</pre> 
 
 <p>You might think this rarely occurs since all the arguments of 
 <span class="v">another-fn</span> must be constants.  You would be right except for one special 
 case: if <span class="v">another-fn</span> takes no arguments, i.e., is a constant function, 
 then every call of it fits this case.  Thus, if you define a function <span class="v">f</span> 
 of no arguments in terms of a constrained function <span class="v">g</span>, you may 
 often see <span class="v">(f)</span> rewrite to:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> "Failed attempt to call constrained function G"
               (f))).</pre> 
 
 <p>We do not hide the term if the <a href="ACL2____EXECUTABLE-COUNTERPART.html">executable-counterpart</a> of the 
 function is <a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a>d â€” because we do not try to evaluate it in 
 the first place.  Thus, to prevent the insertion of a <span class="v">hide</span> term into the 
 proof attempt, you can globally disable the executable-counterpart of the 
 offending defined function, e.g.,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> (:executable-counterpart another-fn))).</pre> 
 
 <p>It is conceivable that you cannot afford to do this: perhaps some calls of 
 the offending function must be computed while others cannot be.  One way to 
 handle this situation is to leave the executable-counterpart enabled, so that 
 <span class="v">hide</span> terms are introduced on the calls that cannot be computed, but prove 
 explicit <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules for each of those <span class="v">hide</span> terms.  For 
 example, suppose that in the proof of some theorem, thm, it is necessary to 
 leave the executable-counterpart of <span class="v">another-fn</span> enabled but that the call 
 <span class="v">(another-fn 1 2 3)</span> arises in the proof and cannot be computed.  Thus the 
 proof attempt will introduce the term <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> ".." (another-fn 1 2
 3)))</span> mentioned above.  Suppose that you can show that <span class="v">(another-fn 1 2
 3)</span> is <span class="v">(constrained-fn 1 2 3)</span> and that such a step is necessary to the 
 proof.  Unfortunately, proving the rewrite rule</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> thm-helper
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (another-fn 1 2 3) (constrained-fn 1 2 3)))</pre> 
 
 <p>would not help the proof of thm because the target term is hidden inside 
 the <span class="v">hide</span>.  However,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> thm-helper
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> "Failed attempt to call constrained function CONSTRAINED-FN"
                        (another-fn 1 2 3)))
         (constrained-fn 1 2 3)))</pre> 
 
 <p>would be applied in the proof of thm and is the rule you should prove.</p> 
 
 <p>Now to prove <span class="v">thm-helper</span> you need to use the two ``tricks'' which have 
 already been discussed.  First, to eliminate the <span class="v">hide</span> term in the proof 
 of <span class="v">thm-helper</span> you should include a hint to <span class="v">:expand</span> that term. 
 Second, to prevent the <span class="v">hide</span> term from being reintroduced when the system 
 tries and fails to evaluate <span class="v">(another-fn 1 2 3)</span> you should include the 
 hint <span class="v">:in-theory</span> <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> (:executable-counterpart another-fn))</span>. 
 Thus, <span class="v">thm-helper</span> will actually be:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> thm-helper
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> "Failed attempt to call constrained function CONSTRAINED-FN"
                        (another-fn 1 2 3)))
         (constrained-fn 1 2 3))
  :hints
  (("Goal" :expand
           (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> "Failed attempt to call constrained function CONSTRAINED-FN"
                          (another-fn 1 2 3)))
           :in-theory (<a href="ACL2____DISABLE.html">disable</a> (:executable-counterpart another-fn)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____EVISCERATE-HIDE-TERMS.html">eviscerate-hide-terms</a> for how to affect the printing of 
 <span class="v">hide</span> terms.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, note that you can avoid the generation of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a></span> calls 
 inside the generated call of <span class="v">hide</span>, as was the case through ACL2 Version 
 8.2, as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH-SYSTEM.html">defattach-system</a> ; generates (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a> ...))
  hide-with-comment-p
  constant-nil-function-arity-0)</pre> 
 
 <p>After evaluation of this event, our running example <span class="v">(another-fn 1 2 3)</span> 
 would generate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (another-fn 1 2 3))</span> rather than a term of the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> (<a href="ACL2____COMMENT.html">comment</a> "..." (another-fn 1 2 3)))</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>In some cases such backward compatibility might also be achieved as 
 follows; also see <a href="ACL2____GUARD-HOLDERS.html">guard-holders</a>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH-SYSTEM.html">defattach-system</a> ; generates (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a> ...))
