<p>Release notes for the ACL2 Community Books for ACL2 8.0</p><p>The following is a brief summary of changes made to the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> between the releases of ACL2 7.4 and 8.0.</p> 
 
 <p>See also <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-0.html">note-8-0</a> for the changes made to ACL2 itself.  For 
 additional details, you may also see the raw <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master" target="_blank"><nobr>commit log<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2/commits/master"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>New Libraries</h3> 
 
 <h4>Supporting materials for the 2017 ACL2 Workshop</h4> 
 
 <p>See the new directory, <span class="v">workshops/2017/</span> — specifically, its 
 <span class="v">README</span> file.</p> 
 
 <h4>SAT proof-checker for cube-and-conquer</h4> 
 
 <p>The new directory is <span class="v">projects/sat/lrat/cube/</span>.  See file <span class="v">README</span> in 
 that directory.</p> 
 
 <h4>SAT proof-checker from 2011</h4> 
 
 <p>An early SAT proof-checker based on resolution may be found in directory 
 <span class="v">books/projects/sat/zz-resolution-checker/</span>; see the <span class="v">README</span> in that 
 directory.  It was sufficiently efficient to get limited use in industry, but 
 ultimately was superseded by much more efficient clause-based 
 proof-checking (see directory <span class="v">books/projects/sat/lrat/</span>).</p> 
 
 <h4>EDIF conversion</h4> 
 
 <p>See <span class="v">projects/async/tools/convert-edif.lisp</span> for tools to convert 
 between EDIF format and corresponding convenient s-expressions.</p> 
 
 <h4>try-gl-concls</h4> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____TRY-GL-CONCLS.html">try-gl-concls</a> for a small but convenient utility to 
 find all the true conclusions (if any) from a user-provided list of 
 possible conclusions using <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a>.</p> 
 
 <h4>GLMC</h4> 
 
 <p>GLMC (in directory <span class="v">centaur/glmc</span>) is a connection from ACL2 to 
 AIG-based hardware model checkers, via <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a>; this can be used to 
 prove safety properties without finding an inductive invariant.  See <a href="GL____GLMC.html">gl::glmc</a> for details.</p> 
 
 <h4>Truth</h4> 
 
 <p>Directory <span class="v">centaur/truth</span> contains a library for using integers as a 
 representation for Boolean functions with small (single-digit) numbers of 
 variables, expressing the functions as truth tables.  Truth tables for 5 or 
 fewer variables are especially efficient since the formulas are represented as 
 fixnums (at least in 64-bit lisps).</p> 
 
 <h4>Ipasir</h4> 
 
 <p>The <a href="IPASIR____IPASIR.html">ipasir::ipasir</a> library (in directory <span class="v">centaur/ipasir</span>) 
 contains an axiomatized interface for using incremental SAT solver libraries in 
 ACL2.  A solver object is represented as an abstract stobj, and actual solver 
 functions from a suitable shared library can be called as the implementation. 
 Integration with <a href="ACL2____AIGNET.html">aignet</a> is also provided in the book 
 <span class="v">centaur/aignet/ipasir</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4>ABNF</h4> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ABNF____ABNF.html">ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) 
 library</a> provides (1) a formalization of the syntax and semantics of the 
 ABNF notation, (2) a verified parser that turns ABNF grammar text (e.g. from 
 the HTTP RFC) into a formal representation suitable for formal 
 specification (e.g. for HTTP parsing), and (3) executable operations on ABNF 
 grammars, e.g.  to check their well-formedness and to compose them.</p> 
 
 <h4>APT</h4> 
 
 <p>The <a href="APT____APT.html">APT (Automated Program Transformations) 
 library</a> provides tools to transform programs and program specifications 
 with automated support.</p> 
 
 <h3>Changes to Existing Libraries</h3> 
 
 <h4><a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">std/io</a></h4> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____STD_F2IO.html">std/io</a> library now contains lemmas to help users prove 
 that opened input and output channels remain open until closed, to 
 aid guard theorem proofs.  See <a href="ACL2____OPEN-CHANNEL-LEMMAS.html">open-channel-lemmas</a>.</p> 
 
 <h4>Miscellaneous <a href="ACL2____STD.html">std</a> changes</h4> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">why</span> and <span class="v">why-explain</span> convenience macros in 
 <span class="v">std/std-customization.lsp</span> now support rule classes other than 
 <span class="v">:rewrite</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The rule <span class="v">sets-are-true-lists</span> has been split into three rules with the 
 same formula: a disabled <a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a> rule of that name, a <a href="ACL2____COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a> rule <span class="v">sets-are-true-lists-compound-recognizer</span>, and a 
 rewrite rule <span class="v">sets-are-true-lists-cheap</span> whose <a href="ACL2____BACKCHAIN-LIMIT.html">backchain-limit</a> is 
 1.</p> 
 
 <p>A new utility <span class="v">def-updater-independence-thm</span> for proving stobj (and 
 stobj-style) accessors independent of updaters has been added to 
 <span class="v">std/stobjs/updater-independence.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4>Kestrel Utilities</h4> 
 
 <p>The <a href="ACL2____KESTREL-UTILITIES.html">Kestrel Utilities</a> have 
 undergone several improvements and extensions.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved an error message for <span class="v">verify-guards-program</span> (thanks to Eric 
 Smith for feedback); see 
 <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/verify-guards-program.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added utilities <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS-EVAL-STATE.html">trans-eval-state</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS-EVAL-ERROR-TRIPLE.html">trans-eval-error-triple</a></span>, which provide convenient interfaces to the ACL2 
 evaluator, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRANS-EVAL.html">trans-eval</a></span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DIRECTED-UNTRANSLATE.html">directed-untranslate</a></span>, especially for handling 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> expressions (and <span class="v">lambda</span> expressions) and 
 towards ensuring executability of its results.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved the utility, <span class="v">copy-def</span>, to avoid failures for some functions 
 defined by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span>.  Thanks to Eric Smith for a helpful bug 
 report.</p> 
 
 <p>Added utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ER-SOFT_B2.html">er-soft+</a></span> for producing soft errors with <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a></span> mode code, returning a specified <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>.  The new utility 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ER-SOFT-LOGIC.html">er-soft-logic</a></span> is similar but a bit simpler, for use when the only 
 property needed of the returned <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a> is that its error 
 component is not <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Added utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MANAGE-SCREEN-OUTPUT.html">manage-screen-output</a></span> which is an improved version of 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CONTROL-SCREEN-OUTPUT.html">control-screen-output</a></span> (which may eventually be removed).  Added 
 utilities <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT-TERSE.html">make-event-terse</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RESTORE-OUTPUT.html">restore-output</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RESTORE-OUTPUT_F3.html">restore-output?</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FAIL-EVENT.html">fail-event</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRY-EVENT.html">try-event</a></span> to fine-tune 
 screen output in event-generating macros.  Moved obsolete utility 
 <span class="v">control-screen-output-and-maybe-replay</span> to Workshop supporting materials, 
 where the only remaining use of this utility was.</p> 
 
 <p>The new utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ORELSE.html">orelse</a></span> arranges to evaluate an event and, if that 
 fails, then to evaluate a second event.</p> 
 
 <p>The applicability condition utilities have been replaced with the <a href="ACL2____NAMED-FORMULAS.html">named formula utilities</a>, which are 
 slightly more general and include a few improvements.</p> 
 
 <p>New <a href="ACL2____PAIRED-NAMES.html">paired name utilities</a> have been 
 added, to construct names consisting of two names separated by a global 
 customizable separator.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-CONST-TO-UNTRANSLATE-PREPROCESS.html">add-const-to-untranslate-preprocess</a></span> utility has been added 
 that extend <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UNTRANSLATE-PREPROCESS.html">untranslate-preprocess</a></span> to keep a constant unexpanded in 
 output.</p> 
 
 <p>New <a href="ACL2____ERROR-CHECKING.html">error-checking</a> utilities have been added that check conditions 
 on data (e.g. user input) and provide informative and consistent error 
 messages. These utilities include a macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEF-ERROR-CHECKER.html">def-error-checker</a></span> to 
 concisely define error-checking functions.</p> 
 
 <p>A new macro <span class="v">defbyte</span> has been added that introduces <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">fixtypes</a> for signed or unsigned bytes of specified sizes. Several 
 instances of applications of this macro for common sizes of both signed and 
 unsigned bytes is also provided.</p> 
 
 <p>Utilities <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOUBLETS-TO-ALIST.html">doublets-to-alist</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____KEYWORD-VALUE-LIST-TO-ALIST.html">keyword-value-list-to-alist</a></span> 
 have been added that convert lists of doublets and keyword-value lists to 
 corresponding alists.</p> 
 
 <p>A utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSERT_F3.html">assert?</a></span> has been added that is a variant of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ASSERT_42.html">assert$</a></span> with customizable context and message.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INTEGERS-FROM-TO.html">integers-from-to</a></span> utility now has a logical definition that is 
 easier to reason about than its tail-recursive definition for execution (which 
 has not changed).</p> 
 
 <p>The Kestrel world query utilities, term utilities, <a href="ACL2____STRING-UTILITIES.html">string utilities</a>, and character utilities 
 (<span class="v">[books]/kestrel/utilities/characters.lisp</span>) have undergone several 
 improvements and extensions.</p> 
 
 <p>A few theorems about world-related functions and theorems about lists (in 
 <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/list-theorems.lisp</span>) have been added.</p> 
 
 <p>A new <a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a>-mode utility, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAGIC-MACROEXPAND.html">magic-macroexpand</a></span>, performs 
 macroexpansion when all macros to be expanded are in logic mode.</p> 
 
 <p>There is a new Kestrel symbol utilities book (initially with a single 
 function, <span class="v">symbol-package-name-safe</span>).</p> 
 
 <h4>The apply books</h4> 
 
 <p>Updated books pertaining to <span class="v">apply$</span>; see <span class="v">projects/apply-model/</span> and 
 <span class="v">projects/apply/</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4>SAT proof-checker</h4> 
 
 <p>Additions and improvements have been made to the SAT proof-checker 
 directories, under <span class="v">projects/sat/lrat/</span>.  In particular, the proof was 
 completed for the incremental checker (subdirectory <span class="v">incremental/</span> with an 
 improved soundness theorem; a new directory was addded (<span class="v">cube/</span>, as 
 mentioned above); and renamed subdirectory <span class="v">main/</span> to <span class="v">sorted/</span>.  The 
 key subdirectory is <span class="v">incremental/</span>; a new top-level book <span class="v">top.lisp</span> 
 includes the top-level book in that subdirectory.</p> 
 
 <h4>Aignet library</h4> 
 
 <p>A few new verified <a href="AIGNET____AIGNET-COMB-TRANSFORMS.html"> 
 combinational logic transforms</a> have been 
 added to aignet, most notably <a href="AIGNET____FRAIG.html">fraiging</a>, 
 DAG-aware <a href="AIGNET____REWRITE.html">rewriting</a>, and 
 DAG-aware and-tree <a href="AIGNET____BALANCE.html">balancing</a>. 
 These can be used as preprocessors for SAT solving with GL via <a href="GL____GL-SIMPLIFY-SATLINK-MODE.html">gl::gl-simplify-satlink-mode</a>.</p> 
 
 <h4>VL/SV libraries</h4> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>SystemVerilog <span class="v">unique case</span> and <span class="v">unique0 case</span> can now optionally be 
 treated differently from regular <span class="v">case</span> statements: either a constraint may 
 be generated off to the side expressing the one-hot constraint, or logic may be 
 added that assigns <span class="v">X</span> instead of the stated values when the one-hot constraint 
 is violated.</li> 
 
 <li>Somewhat similarly, <span class="v">enum</span> type variables may optionally either 
 generate constraints stating that they take proper enum values, or may generate 
 extra logic that forces them to <span class="v">X</span> when assigned an improper value.</li> 
 
 <li>When composing together 0-delay update functions, if bit-level 
 combinational loops are present, these are composed together to a fixpoint.</li> 
 
 <li>
<a href="VL____VL-LINT.html">vl::vl-lint</a> has yet another use-set check, <a href="VL____VL-DESIGN-SV-USE-SET.html">vl::vl-design-sv-use-set</a>, 
 which uses SV's interpretation of SystemVerilog semantics to more exactly 
 analyze the usage and updates of module variables.  The previous <a href="VL____LUCID.html">vl::lucid</a> 
 use-set check is still useful since sv-use-set only checks variables, not 
 parameters, functions, types, etc., and also does not analyze variables local 
 to procedural code blocks.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h4>SOFT</h4> 
 
 <p>The <a href="SOFT____SOFT.html">SOFT (Second-Order Functions and 
 Theorems) library</a> has been improved in several ways. The <span class="v">:thm-name</span> 
 option is now fully supported for second-order quantifier functions and their 
 instances.  The treatment of user inputs is more robust. The user interface is 
 more terse. The implementation is more streamlined. A more comprehensive test 
 suite now exists.</p> 
 
 <h4>X86ISA</h4> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The <a href="ACL2____X86ISA.html">X86ISA</a> has been slightly extended with 
 infrastructure to support 32-bit mode of operation; in particular, the 
 <span class="v">64-bit-modep</span> predicate is no longer always true. Some documentation 
 topics and some comments have been expanded and clarified. Some exceptions are 
 now being added to the fault field of the x86 state rather than the 
 model-specific field. A complete model of segment address translation has been 
 added.</li> 
 
 <li>Codewalker can now be used to reason about 64-bit user-level x86 
 programs --- see 
 <span class="v">books/projects/x86isa/proofs/codewalker-examples</span> for demos.</li> 
 
 <li>Memory functions do not traffic in lists anymore.  Instead of a 
 list of canonical addresses, a contiguous linear memory region is now 
 specified by: <span class="v">&lt;n, lin-addr&gt;</span>, where <span class="v">n</span> is the number of bytes 
 to be read or written and <span class="v">lin-addr</span> is the first address of the 
 memory region.</li> 
 
 <li>In the programmer-level mode, disjointness of memory regions can 
 be conveniently expressed using a function called <span class="v">separate</span>.  All 
 the proofs in the programmer-level mode have been updated to use this 
 paradigm.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h4>AVR ISA</h4> 
 <p>Julien Schmaltz and Peter Schwabes' AVR ISA model has been contributed in book 
 <span class="v">projects/avr-isa</span>.</p> 
 
 <h4>Miscellaneous Books</h4> 
 
 <p>The book <span class="v">clause-processors/use-by-hint</span> now contains an additional 
 utility, <a href="ACL2____USE-TERMHINT.html">use-termhint</a>, that helps structure hints in a way that 
 coincides with the structure of a proof and allows hints to contain terms that 
 have been simplified along with the goal.</p> 
 
 <p>A new book <span class="v">tools/symlet</span> introduces a macro <span class="v">let-syms</span> and <span class="v">b*</span> 
 binder <span class="v">symlet</span> that simply replace occurrences of some symbols with some 
 corresponding terms in the enclosed term.  Like Common Lisp's 
 <span class="v">symbol-macrolet</span> but much less smart.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed <span class="v">misc/profiling.lisp</span> for newer distributions of CCL (Clozure 
 Common Lisp), both from SVN and from GitHub.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONSTS.html">defconsts</a></span> now provides a better error message when given 
 a symbol that does not have the syntax of a constant.</p> 
 
 <p>The macro <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a></span> has a new keyword option, <span class="v">:expected</span>, to 
 indicate the kind of error that is expected.  New macros <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENSURE-SOFT-ERROR.html">ensure-soft-error</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENSURE-HARD-ERROR.html">ensure-hard-error</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENSURE-ERROR.html">ensure-error</a></span> 
 provide nice interfaces to <span class="v">must-fail</span> with the legal values of this new 
 option.  See <a href="ACL2____MUST-FAIL.html">must-fail</a>.  Thanks to Eric Smith for discussions leading 
 to these changes.</p> 
 
 <p>Modified <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVABLE-RUNES.html">removable-runes</a></span> to allow a multiplier greater than 1. 
 Modified output accordingly.  Also, the multiplier <span class="v">m</span> now provides 
 non-strict bounds <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____FLOOR.html">floor</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> m steps) 1)</span> rather than the previous 
 strict bound <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____1-.html">1-</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CEILING.html">ceiling</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____A2.html">*</a> m steps) 1))</span>.  Moreover, a related new utility, 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MINIMAL-RUNES.html">minimal-runes</a></span>, returns a list of runes to enable that is sufficient 
 for admitting the event.</p> 
 
 <h3>Licensing Changes</h3> 
 
 <h3>Build System Updates</h3> 
 
 <p>Improved books cleaning slightly, in <span class="v">books/GNUmakefile</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, the <span class="v">'make'</span> targets for certifying books now include the 
 books that depend on quicklisp, except when the host Lisp is GCL.  Specify 
 <span class="v">USE_QUICKLISP=0</span> if that is not what you want.</p> 
 
 <p>Improved <span class="v">books/GNUmakefile</span> so that by default, it reports an error 
 when the <span class="v">bash</span> shell is missing.  (Note that a version of <span class="v">sh</span> on a 
 FreeBSD machine caused an error.)</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-0.html">note-8-0</a>, specifically the section on ``Changes at the 
 System Level''.</p> 
 
 <h3>Testing</h3> 
 
 <p>The documentation topics for testing have been reorganized, with 
 introduction of a new topic, <span class="v">kestrel-testing-utilities</span>, as a parent of 
 the testing utilities that are part of the <a href="ACL2____KESTREL-BOOKS.html">kestrel-books</a>, so that now 
 the topic <a href="ACL2____TESTING-UTILITIES.html">testing-utilities</a> is the top-level topic for the testing 
 utilities.</p> 
 
 <p>The Kestrel Testing Utilities have been integrated with similar testing 
 utilities under <span class="v">[books]/misc</span>.  The utilities in 
 <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/testing.lisp</span> have been added to <span class="v">misc/eval.lisp</span> and 
 <span class="v">misc/assert.lisp</span>, and the tests in 
 <span class="v">kestrel/utilities/testing-tests.lisp</span> have been moved into two new files 
 <span class="v">misc/eval-test.lisp</span> and <span class="v">misc/assert-tests.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RUN-SCRIPT.html">run-script</a></span> supports testing of evaluation of the forms 
 in a given file, to check that the output is as expected.  So far, several 
 existing scripts have been adapted to take advantage of this utility:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">books/demos/mini-proveall-input.lsp</span> — a long-standing, small 
 basic test of ACL2</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">books/demos/marktoberdorf-08/</span> — based on material originally 
 presented by J Moore in 2008 at the Marktoberdorf Summer School; see the 
 <span class="v">README</span> file in that directory</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">books/demos/big-proof-talks/</span> — based on material about ACL2 
 presented by J Moore on July 6 and 7, 2017, at the <a href="https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/bpr" target="_blank"><nobr>Big Proof workshop<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.newton.ac.uk/event/bpr"></nobr></a>; see the 
 <span class="v">README</span> file in that directory</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">books/projects/paco/books/proveall-input.lsp</span>, formerly named 
 <span class="v">proveall.lsp</span>
</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <h3>Miscellaneous</h3> 
 
 <p>Added file <span class="v">system/to-do.txt</span> to list some potential developer 
 tasks.</p> 
 
 <p>Fixed a bug in the package redefinition utility in community book 
 <span class="v">books/misc/redef-pkg.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Defined a constant <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2ACL2-SYSTEM-EXPORTS_A2.html">*ACL2-system-exports*</a></span> that extends <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2_____A2ACL2-EXPORTS_A2.html">*ACL2-exports*</a></span> for system programmers.</p>
