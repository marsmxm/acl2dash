<p>Print the one-step macroexpansion of a form</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> for background on translated and untranslated terms, 
 including some discussion of macros.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">Examples:
:trans1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____LIST.html">list</a> a b c)
:trans1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CADDR.html">caddr</a> x)
:trans1 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a> (p q) (r))</pre> 
 
 <p>This utility takes one argument, an alleged untranslated term, and expands 
 the top-level macro in it for one step only.  Either an error is caused, which 
 happens when the form is not a call of a macro, or the result is printed. 
 Also see <a href="ACL2____TRANS.html">trans</a>, which translates the given form completely.</p> 
 
 <p>On very rare occasions, complete translation is not quite the same as 
 translating the output of <span class="v">:trans1</span>, though the two should still be 
 logically equivalent.  This can happen for a call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STOBJ-LET.html">stobj-let</a></span> in the 
 body of a function: its translation may include a check for duplicate indices 
 that is omitted in the single-step macroexpansion.</p>
