<p>Printing routines for displaying SystemVerilog constructs.</p><p>Using the VL <a href="VL____PRINTER.html">printer</a>, we implement pretty-printing routines 
to display our internal parse-tree representation (see <a href="VL____SYNTAX.html">syntax</a>) as 
SystemVerilog code.  These functions produce either plain text or html output, 
depending upon the <span class="v">htmlp</span> setting in the printer state, <a href="VL____PS.html">ps</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The pretty-printer is intended to be useful and convenient for humans to 
read, but it is <b>not necessarily trustworthy</b>.  For instance:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Internally, VL generally keeps constructs like wire declarations and port 
declarations separate from assignments and module instances.  When we print out 
a module with routines like <a href="VL____VL-PP-MODULE.html">vl-pp-module</a>, the result is often 
reasonable, but it is easy to imagine cases where it could not be given to 
another Verilog tool because the resulting module no longer corresponds to the 
original parse order.</li> 
 
<li>For certain constructs, such as post-elaborated generate blocks, there is 
no corresponding Verilog syntax that provides the same scoping and name 
resolution.  In this case we print out something that resembles Verilog and 
that is not hard for a human to understand, but that would not be accepted by 
any tool that expected to get well-formed Verilog as input.</li> 
 
</ul>
