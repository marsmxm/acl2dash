<p>Scopestacks deal with namespaces in SystemVerilog by tracking the 
bindings of names in scopes.  They provide a straightforward, correct way to 
look up identifiers.</p><h3>Namespaces in SystemVerilog</h3> 
 
<p>SystemVerilog has a complicated system of namespaces, but it mostly boils 
down to a few categories of names for things:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<b>items,</b> (our name), including nets/variables, parameters, 
instances (of modules, gates, UDPs, and interfaces), typedefs, functions, 
tasks, and named generate blocks;</li> 
 
<li>
<b>definitions,</b> including module, UDP, interface, and program 
declarations;</li> 
 
<li>
<b>ports</b>;</li> 
 
<li>and <b>packages</b>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>The items are the most complicated.  Packages occur only at the global 
scope.  Ports only occur in modules and interfaces.  In principle the 
SystemVerilog spec allows for nested modules and interfaces, but most 
implementations don't support this and neither do we, so definitions can only 
occur at the global scope.  In contrast, to look for an item, we first look in 
the most local scope; if it isn't found there, we search subsequent nested 
scopes until we get to the global scope.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Scopestacks</h3> 
 
<p>A scopestack is a structure that holds representations of nested scopes. 
Each scope may be one of several types, namely the types on the left-hand 
column of the table <a href="VL_____A2VL-SCOPES-_E3ITEMS_A2.html">*vl-scopes-&gt;items*</a>:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(interface module
           genblob blockscope design package)</pre> 
 
<p>Whenever we search a scope, we call a <a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a>d function that turns 
that scope representation into a fast alist, in which we look up the name. 
That way, subsequent lookups in the same scope will be constant-time.  This 
design means that you may occasionally need to free up memory associated with 
scopestacks; see <a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACKS-FREE.html">vl-scopestacks-free</a>.</p> 
 
 
<h5>Construction and Maintenance</h5> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">nil</span> is an empty scopestack (without even the global design scope).</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-INIT.html">vl-scopestack-init</a> design)</span> creates a scopestack with only the global 
scope of the design visible.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-PUSH.html">vl-scopestack-push</a> scope ss)</span> pushes a new nested scope onto the 
scopestack.  Typically you will need to call this function as you "enter" a 
new scope, e.g., as your analysis or transformation descends into a particular 
module, function, etc.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-POP.html">vl-scopestack-pop</a> ss)</span> removes the innermost scope from the 
scopestack, but this is <b>rarely needed</b> because scopestacks are 
applicative.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACKS-FREE.html">vl-scopestacks-free</a>)</span> clears the memoization tables associated with 
scopestacks, which in CCL also will allow their associated fast-alists to be 
garbage collected.  We don't currently have a mechanism free these fast alists 
otherwise.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h5>Accessing Items</h5> 
 
<p>The interface for accessing items is more complex than for definitions and 
packages because items may be found in multiple scopes.</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-FIND-ITEM.html">vl-scopestack-find-item</a> name ss)</span> searches the scopestack for the 
given name (a string).  The declaration of the item is returned as a <a href="VL____VL-SCOPEITEM.html">vl-scopeitem</a>.  The more specific type of the declaration, e.g., <a href="VL____VL-VARDECL.html">vl-vardecl</a>, <a href="VL____VL-MODINST.html">vl-modinst</a>, etc., can be determined by examining its 
tag.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-FIND-ITEM_F2SS.html">vl-scopestack-find-item/ss</a> name ss)</span> returns <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> item new-ss)</span>, 
where item is the same as returned by <span class="v">vl-scopestack-find-item</span> and 
<span class="v">new-ss</span> is the scopestack visible from that item's declaration.  For 
instance, if you are deep within a bunch of nested begin/end blocks, the 
<span class="v">new-ss</span> you get back might be for some superior block, the whole module, or 
the scopestack for some entirely different package where the <span class="v">item</span> is 
declared..</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-FIND-ITEM_F2CONTEXT.html">vl-scopestack-find-item/context</a> name ss)</span> returns <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> item ctx-ss
package)</span>.  Here <span class="v">item</span> is the same as above.  The <span class="v">ctx-ss</span> is similar 
to the <span class="v">new-ss</span> above <b>but</b> packages are handled differently.  In 
particular, <span class="v">ctx-ss</span> here is always the scopestack for some superior scope 
where the item was found.  If <span class="v">item</span> is imported from a package, then 
 <ul> 
    <li>
<span class="v">ctx-ss</span> refers to, e.g., the module where the item was imported into, whereas</li> 
    <li>
<span class="v">new-ss</span> refers to the package that the item was imported from</li> 
 </ul> 
The separate <span class="v">package</span> return value is a maybe-string that gives the name 
of the package where the item was imported from, if applicable.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
 
<h5>Accessing Non-Items</h5> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-FIND-DEFINITION.html">vl-scopestack-find-definition</a> name ss)</span> is similar to -find-item, but 
finds a definition instead of an item.  The <span class="v">definition/ss</span> and 
<span class="v">definition/context</span> versions also exist, but aren't as informative since 
the definition can (currently) only exist at the global scope.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPESTACK-FIND-PACKAGE.html">vl-scopestack-find-package</a> name ss)</span>, similar.</li> 
 
<li>
<span class="v">(<a href="VL____VL-SCOPE-FIND-PORTDECL-FAST.html">vl-scope-find-portdecl-fast</a> name scope)</span> is similar, but acts only on a 
scope, not a stack of them, since searching beyond the local module for a port 
doesn't make much sense.</li> 
 
</ul>
