<p>Abstract syntax of ABNF.</p><p>ABNF is a language to describe the concrete syntax of languages. 
    Being itself a language, 
    ABNF has its own concrete syntax, described in [RFC:4] using ABNF itself. 
    To break the self-description circularity, 
    we start by formalizing an abstract syntax of ABNF, 
    based on an inspection of the concrete syntax in [RFC:4]. 
    The ABNF abstract syntax abstracts away from the ABNF concrete syntax 
    things that are not relevant to the ABNF <a href="ABNF____SEMANTICS.html">semantics</a>, 
    such as blank space and comments, 
    as well as certain restrictions 
    that are not needed to define the semantics.</p>
