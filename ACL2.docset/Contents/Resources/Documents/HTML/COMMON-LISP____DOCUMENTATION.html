<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION">Click for Documentation in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Information about options for downloading and viewing the ACL2 
 documentation, contributing documentation, and the available tools for 
 documenting your own books.</p><h3>Available Documentation</h3> 
 
 <p>If you are new to ACL2, see the <a href="ACL2____ACL2-TUTORIAL.html">ACL2-tutorial</a> for introductory 
 tours, tutorials, and information about textbooks about ACL2.  The <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2 home page<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2"></nobr></a> also 
 provides many links to academic publications about ACL2, including the ACL2 
 Workshop series.</p> 
 
 <p>Beyond these resources, there is a vast <b>ACL2+Books Manual</b> with 
 reference material covering the ACL2 system itself and also many <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>.  There are a few ways to access the manual:</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<b>The online version (recommended).</b> If you expect to have an internet 
 connection while using the documentation, you may prefer to use the online 
 version of the <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-5/combined-manual/index.html" target="_blank"><nobr>ACL2+Books Manual<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/v8-5/combined-manual/index.html"></nobr></a>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<b>A local version.</b> If you sometimes work without an internet 
 connection, you can <a href="download/" target="_blank"><nobr>download<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to download/"></nobr></a> a local copy of any 
 web-based XDOC manual using the "down arrow" icon at the top of the page. 
 You can alternately build your own copy of the manual; see <i>Building 
 the manual</i> in <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION.html">books-certification</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<b>The ACL2-Doc Emacs version.</b> If you would like to view the 
 documentation using Emacs instead of a web browser, there is a feature-rich 
 Emacs-based documentation browser provided by the ACL2 system.  See <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DOC.html">ACL2-doc</a> for details.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>While you are using ACL2, you can get documentation at the terminal with 
 the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DOC.html">doc</a></span> command, e.g., by typing <span class="v">:doc rewrite</span>.  This is 
 often handy, but note that it won't show you any documentation for books that 
 you haven't loaded yet!</p> 
 
 <p>Separately from the ACL2+Books Manual, the <u>ACL2 User's Manual</u> is 
 distributed with ACL2.  This is much like the ACL2+Books Manual but it does 
 not include documentation from the books.  A web-based copy is included with 
 the ACL2 distribution in directory <span class="v">doc/manual/</span>, and you can easily get to 
 it by opening file <span class="v">doc/home-page.html</span> in your browser.</p> 
 
 
 <h3>Documenting Your Books</h3> 
 
 <p>Documentation is written using <a href="ACL2____XDOC.html">xdoc</a>, and may be found in the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>.  Everyone is welcome to edit and contribute to that 
 documentation.  In particular, you are welcome to edit the book that contains 
 ACL2 system documentation, <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>.  (Please do 
 not edit ACL2 source file <span class="v">doc.lisp</span>, which is generated from that book. 
 More generally, edit only files under the <span class="v">books/</span> directory.)</p> 
 
 <p>You can also use XDOC to document your own books and to build custom 
 manuals for your organization.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark for Experienced Users</b>.  Occasionally it might make sense to 
 add a link to your book's documentation from the ACL2 system documentation, 
 which is in <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOK.html">community-book</a> <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>. You are 
 welcome to do so, but in that case, also add to the constant 
 <span class="v">*acl2-broken-links-alist*</span> near the top of that file, as described in a 
 comment in that constant.  For example, that constant's value has the 
 following line.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">FTY::DEFPROD</a> "[books]/centaur/fty/top.lisp")</pre> 
 
 <p>That line may have been added because in the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____DEFXDOC.html">defxdoc</a> defrec ...)</span> 
 in <span class="v">acl2-doc.lisp</span>, we find a link to <span class="v">fty::defprod</span>.  You can do 
 similarly for your own added link.</p> 
 
 <p>If your topic is not in the <span class="v">"ACL2"</span> package, such as in the example 
 link <span class="v">fty::defprod</span> above, then add a suitable <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> form to 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/cert.acl2</span>.  For example, that file includes the line</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/fty/portcullis" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
 <p>in order to define the <span class="v">"FTY"</span> package.  End of Remark for 
 Experienced Users</p> 
 
 <h3>Other Resources</h3> 
 
 <p>If you want documentation on an ACL2 function or macro that is not 
 documented, there are still several alternatives.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:args fn</pre> 
 
 <p>will print the arguments and some other relevant information about the 
 named function or macro.  This information is all gleaned from the definition 
 and hence this is a definitive way to determine if <span class="v">fn</span> is defined as a 
 function or macro.</p> 
 
 <p>You might also want to type:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;:pc fn</pre> 
 
 <p>which will print the <a href="ACL2____COMMAND.html">command</a> that introduced <span class="v">fn</span>.  You should 
 see <a href="ACL2____COMMAND-DESCRIPTOR.html">command-descriptor</a> for details on the kinds of input you can give 
 the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PC.html">pc</a></span> command.</p>
