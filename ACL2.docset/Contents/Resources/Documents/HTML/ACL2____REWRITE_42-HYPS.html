<p>Rewrite a list of hypotheses</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____REWRITE_42.html">rewrite$</a> for relevant background.</p> 
 
 <p>Roughly speaking, <span class="v">rewrite$-hyps</span> applies rewriting to each term in a 
 given list.  However, it treats that input as a list of hypotheses: each term 
 in the list is rewritten under the assumption that the other terms in the list 
 are true.  Both <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> and <a href="ACL2____LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">linear-arithmetic</a> are 
 used.</p> 
 
 <h3>General Form</h3> 
 
 <p>All arguments of <span class="v">rewrite$-hyps</span> except the first are keyword arguments, 
 hence are optional, with appropriate defaults.  All are evaluated.</p>

 <p>This macro returns an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a> whose non-erroneous value is a 
 list of the form <span class="v">(rewritten-hyps rrec ttree . pairs)</span>.  Here, 
 <span class="v">rewritten-hyps</span> is (of course) the result of rewriting the input, 
 <span class="v">hyps</span>; <span class="v">rrec</span> is a so-called ``<span class="v">rewrite$-record</span>'' that can be 
 passed as the <span class="v">:rrec</span> input of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE_42.html">rewrite$</a></span>; <span class="v">ttree</span> is the <a href="ACL2____TAG-TREE.html">tag-tree</a> that records information from the rewriting, including the <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a>s used; and <span class="v">pairs</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> unless there are <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a>d 
 assumptions, which should never happen if input <span class="v">:prove-forced-assumptions</span> 
 has its default value of <span class="v">t</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Additional documentation may be provided here if desired.  It may suffice 
 to see community book <span class="v">books/kestrel/apt/simplify-defun-impl.lisp</span> for an 
 illustration of how <a href="ACL2____REWRITE_42-HYPS.html">rewrite$-hyps</a> may be used.  The key idea there is 
 for <span class="v">rewrite$-hyps</span> to produce the <span class="v">:rrec</span> input of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE_42.html">rewrite$</a></span> 
 when there are repeated calls of <span class="v">rewrite$</span> under the same <span class="v">:hyps</span>, and 
 especially when you want first to simplify those hypotheses (perhaps together 
 with subterm governors).</p>
