<p>A library for Zcash.</p><p><a href="https://z.cash" target="_blank"><nobr>Zcash<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://z.cash"></nobr></a> is a blockchain currency that provides confidentiality 
     via zero-knowledge proofs.</p><p>This library provides an ACL2 formalization of some aspects of Zcash. 
     The formalization is based on the <a href="https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>Zcash Protocol Specification<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/zcash/zips/blob/master/protocol/protocol.pdf"></nobr></a> (Version 2021.1.15 [NU5 proposal] of 2021-09-01, as of this writing), 
     referenced as `[ZPS]' in the documentation of this library. 
     Sections, appendices, theorems, etc. are referenced 
     by appending their designations separated by colo, 
     e.g. 
     `[ZPS:4.1.1]' references Section 4.1.1, 
     `[ZPS:A.2]' references Appendix A.2, and 
     `[ZPS:T.A.2.1]' references Theorem A.2.1 
     (that is, we use `T' to refer to theorems, including lemmas). 
     These square-bracketed references may be used 
     as nouns or parenthentically.</p>
