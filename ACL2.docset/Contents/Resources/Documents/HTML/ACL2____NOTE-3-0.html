 <p>A very few users have contributed books following the instructions on the 
 web.  We expect that when more contributions come in, we will give more 
 attention to the question of how to organize the distributed and workshop 
 books.  For now, we have simply added the new contributions according to the 
 old-style distribution methodology.</p>
