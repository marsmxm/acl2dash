<a href="ACL2____The_02WARNING_02about_02the_02Trivial_02Consequence.html">ACL2 Warning</a> [Subsume] in ( DEFTHM TRIVIAL-CONSEQUENCE ...):  The previously 
added rule ASSOCIATIVITY-OF-APP subsumes the newly proposed :REWRITE 
rule TRIVIAL-CONSEQUENCE, in the sense that the old rule rewrites a 
more general target.  Because the new rule will be tried first, it 
may nonetheless find application. 
 
By the simple :rewrite rule <a href="ACL2____The_02First_02Application_02of_02the_02Associativity_02Rule.html">ASSOCIATIVITY-OF-APP</a> we reduce the conjecture 
to 
 
Goal' 
(EQUAL (APP X1 
            (APP X2 
                 (APP X3 (APP X4 (APP X5 (APP X6 X7))))))

            (APP X2 
                 (APP X3 (APP X4 (APP X5 (APP X6 X7))))))). 
 
But we reduce the conjecture to T, by primitive type reasoning.
