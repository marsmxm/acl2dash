<p>ACL2 Version  2.7 Notes on Changes in Rules and Constants</p><p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONG.html">defcong</a></span> macro has been slightly changed.  The 
 difference is that the variable generated with suffix <span class="v">-EQUIV</span> will now be 
 in the same package as the name of the variable from which it is generated, 
 rather than always belonging to the ACL2 package.  Thanks to Hanbing Liu for 
 suggesting this change.  (Note that a couple of books have been modified to 
 accommodate this change, e.g., <span class="v">books/finite-set-theory/set-theory</span>.)</p> 
 
 <p>In Version_2.6, a change was made for rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> 
 whose conclusion is a term of the form <span class="v">(EQV lhs rhs)</span>, where <span class="v">EQV</span> is 
 <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span>: the rule was stored as though <span class="v">EQV</span> 
 were <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a></span>.  (See <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-6-RULES.html">note-2-6-rules</a>.)  This change has been 
 extended to rules of class <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a></span>.</p>
