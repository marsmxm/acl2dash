<p>Building ACL2 Executables</p><p>Building an ACL2 executable is easy: one simply submits `<span class="v">make</span>' 
 in the top-level ACL2 directory.  Here we say a few words about how that works 
 and comment on some variants.</p> 
 
 <h3>Building with `<span class="v">make</span>'</h3> 
 
 <p>The preceding chapter (see <a href="ACL2____DEVELOPERS-GUIDE-BACKGROUND.html">developers-guide-background</a>) notes five 
 or six different Lisps on which ACL2 may be built.  <font color="#c00000">There 
 have been occasions when an ACL2 bug only showed up with one of those Lisps; 
 so, it is a good idea to build ACL2 in each of them from time to time, when 
 feasible.</font> Just specify <span class="v">LISP</span> on the command line, typically with 
 <span class="v">PREFIX</span> specified as well, which is put on the front of <span class="v">saved_acl2</span>. 
 For example, to build ACL2 in SBCL, you might issue the following shell 
 command to create an SBCL-based ACL2 executable named 
 <span class="v">sbcl-saved_acl2</span>.</p> 
 
 <font color="#c00000"> 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____MAKE.html">make</a> PREFIX=sbcl- LISP=sbcl) &gt;&amp; make-sbcl.log&amp;</pre> 
 </font> 
 
 <font color="#800080"> 
 <p>DEMO: make-acl2 [alias].</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <p>Check the log to see if the build seems to have completed normally, in 
 particular with ``Initialization SUCCEEDED'' printed near the end of the log. 
 It is a good idea to do case-insensitive searches for the string, 
 "compiler", if the Lisp is CCL (you should find four occurrences, all of 
 them for SET-COMPILER-ENABLED) and for "warning:" for the other Lisp 
 implementations (you should find no occurrences except in GCL, pertaining to 
 ``trace'').</p> 
 
 <p>Let us now provide some analysis of what the invocation of `<span class="v">make</span>' is 
 doing.  If you inspect <span class="v">GNUmakefile</span>, you may see these two lines:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"># Top (<a href="ACL2____DEFAULT.html">default</a>) target:
all: large</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, ``<span class="v">make</span>'' is really ``<span class="v">make all</span>'', which is mostly ``<span class="v">make
 large</span>''.  (There was formerly a way to build smaller executables, but no 
 longer.)  That target, in turn, is defined as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">large: acl2r full init</pre> 
 
 <p>Let's briefly consider each of the three targets above.  For details, read 
 <span class="v">GNUmakefile</span>, which is intended to be comprehensible.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">acl2r</span> target just generates a file <span class="v">acl2r.lisp</span> that is loaded 
 in to Lisp at start up by the other two targets.  It defines features that 
 support readtime conditionals during the build process.  For example, by 
 default that file contains the form <span class="v">(push :hons *features*)</span>, so that 
 forms prefixed by <span class="v">#+hons</span> are read while those prefixed by <span class="v">#-hons</span> are 
 ignored.</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">full</span> target compiles source files when compilation is indicated. 
 Compilation is skipped for host Lisps CCL and SBCL because those Lisps compile 
 on-the-fly, hence there is no clear advantage to compiling the source 
 files.</li> 
 
 <li>The <span class="v">init</span> target generates a call of <span class="v">initialize-acl2</span>, which 
 constructs the initial <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> — the so-called ``boot-strap world'' 
 — by running <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> on ACL2 source files.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <p>Not surprisingly, there are many details that we omit here.  We expect ACL2 
 developers to be able to follow the source code and <span class="v">GNUmakefile</span> where 
 they lead when it is important to understand details.</p> 
 
 <h3>Debugging a failed build</h3> 
 
 <p>When a build fails using ``<span class="v">make</span>'', you can generally re-create the 
 failure in an interactive session as follows, so that you can use the Lisp 
 debugger to investigate.  First, look for a file ``<span class="v">workxxx</span>'' in the build 
 directory.  It should contain the forms that were executed in Lisp to get to 
 the error.  So, start Lisp, and then execute each of those forms until you get 
 to the error — it's as simple as that!  (Of course, the debugging that 
 ensues may be simple or complex.)</p> 
 
 <h3>Documentation</h3> 
 
 <font color="#800080"> 
 <p>DEMO: make-doc [alias] COVERS WHAT'S BELOW.</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <p>The generated file <span class="v">doc.lisp</span> can be built in the ACL2 sources directory 
 by invoking <span class="v">make DOC</span> or <span class="v">make update-doc.lisp</span>.  These each will build 
 that file in the ACL2 sources directory, which in turn supports the use of 
 <span class="v">:doc</span> at the terminal without the need to include books.  The way that 
 works is as follows: <span class="v">doc.lisp</span> is generated from 
 <span class="v">books/system/doc/acl2-doc.lisp</span>, and then <span class="v">doc.lisp</span> is processed with 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> as an ACL2 source file to populate the appropriate documentation 
 database.  That database consists of the alist, 
 <span class="v">*acl2-system-documentation*</span>, whose keys are the built-in documented 
 topics.</p> 
 
 <p>Warning: If there are functions, macros, or constants that are keys of 
 <span class="v">*acl2-system-documentation*</span> but do not belong to the constant 
 <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>, then the community book 
 <span class="v">books/misc/check-acl2-exports.lisp</span> will probably fail to certify.  So 
 whenever <span class="v">doc.lisp</span> is regenerated, it is a good idea to recertify that 
 book after deleting its <span class="v">.cert</span> file.</p> 
 
 <p>If you include links to <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a> topics in 
 <span class="v">acl2-doc.lisp</span>, follow the suggestions in the ``Remark for Experienced 
 Users'' in the documentation topic, <a href="COMMON-LISP____DOCUMENTATION.html">documentation</a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Untouchables etc.</h3> 
 
 <p>Note that during the build, ACL2 does not enforce its usual restrictions 
 against using <a href="ACL2____UNTOUCHABLE.html">untouchable</a>s or utilities in the list 
 <span class="v">*ttag-fns-and-macros*</span>.  Be careful!  Those restrictions are in place 
 because their use can destroy the integrity of an ACL2 session.  As 
 developers, we can't be hampered by such restrictions, but in return for this 
 freedom we take responsibility for wise usage.</p> 
 
 <h3>Build-time proofs</h3> 
 
 <p>ACL2 has the ability to ``prove its way through'' some of its source code. 
 Most proofs are skipped by default.  To do such proofs, run `<font color="#c00000"><span class="tt">make proofs</span></font>', which should be done only after 
 compiling the sources if that would normally be done for the host Lisp that is 
 being used.  To be safe it might be best to build ACL2 first the normal way, 
 even if CCL or SBCL is being used and hence sources aren't subjected to 
 <span class="v">compile-file</span>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Proving termination and guards in books: Making a ``devel'' build</h3> 
 
 <font color="#800080"><p>[JUST TOUCH ON THIS SECTION]</p></font> 
 
 <p>Just above, we talk about doing proofs during the build.  That is an 
 admirable thing to do, but it can be difficult to carry out certain proofs, 
 for at least two reasons: the build environment is not interactive, and there 
 is no way to include helpful books during the build.  Fortunately, there is a 
 procedure for deferring those proofs until after the build is complete.  The 
 documentation topic <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS-FOR-SYSTEM-FUNCTIONS.html">verify-guards-for-system-functions</a> provides 
 details.  <font color="#c00000">However, after you have some familiarity with 
 this procedure you might prefer to follow a script given as a comment in 
 <span class="v">*system-verify-guards-alist*</span>.</font></p>
