</dl><h5>Additional Requirements</h5><p>The following invariant is enforced on the fields:</p><pre class="code">(unsigned-byte-p origwidth value)</pre><h3>Detailed Explanation</h3> 
 
          <p>Constant integers are produced from source code constructs like 
          <span class="v">5</span>, <span class="v">4'b0010</span>, and <span class="v">3'h0</span>.</p> 
 
          <p>Note that the value of a constant integer is never negative.  In 
          Verilog there are no negative literals; instead, an expression like 
          <span class="v">-5</span> is basically parsed the same as <span class="v">-(5)</span>, so the negative 
          sign is not part of the literal.  See Section 3.5.1 of the 
          Verilog-2005 standard.</p> 
 
          <p>The <span class="v">origwidth</span> and <span class="v">origsign</span> fields are subtle and you 
          usually <b>should not</b> be looking at the <span class="v">origwidth</span> and 
          <span class="v">origsign</span> of an expression unless you have really studied how 
          sizing works in and you really know what you are doing.</p> 
 
          <p>These fields indicate the <i>original</i> width and signedness of 
          the literal as specified in the source code.  For instance, if the 
          source code contains <span class="v">8'sd 65</span>, then we will get a value whose 
          <span class="v">origwidth</span> is 8 and whose <span class="v">origsign</span> is <span class="v">:vl-signed.</span> 
          <b>However</b>, in general, the process for sizing Verilog 
          expressions can effectively ``change'' the widths and types of the 
          operands within that expression.  For instance, if <span class="v">a</span> and <span class="v">b</span> 
          are unsigned 10-bit wires and we have:</p> 
 
          <pre class="code">assign a = b + 3'sb1;</pre> 
 
          <p>Then even though <span class="v">3'sb1</span> looks like a signed 3-bit integer, the 
          sizing process will convert it into a 10-bit unsigned number!  The 
          takeaway: you can't really rely on the original size and signedness 
          to tell you the real story, so unless you're implementing the sizing 
          algorithm you should probably avoid them.</p> 
 
          <p>We insist that <span class="v">0 &lt;= value &lt;= 2^origwidth</span> for every constant 
          integer.  If our <a href="VL____LEXER.html">lexer</a> encounters something ill-formed like 
          <span class="v">3'b 1111</span>, it emits a warning and truncates the value to the 
          specified width as required by Section 3.5.1 (page 10) of the 
          Verilog-2005 standard and Section 5.7.1 (page 37) of the 
          SystemVerilog standard.</p> 
 
          <p>Note that in Verilog, unsized integer constants like <span class="v">5</span> or 
          <span class="v">'b101</span> have an implementation-dependent size of at least 32 bits. 
          Early versions of VL tried to treat such numbers in an abstract way, 
          saying they had "integer size".  But we eventually decided that 
          this was too error-prone and we now instead act like a 32-bit 
          implementation even at the level of our lexer.  This conveniently 
          makes the width of a constant integer just a positive number.</p> 
 
          <p>There is some risk to this.  Certain expressions may produce 
          different results on 32-bit versus, say, 64-bit implementations. 
          Because of this, we added the <span class="v">wasunsized</span> field so that we might, 
          some day, statically check for problematic uses of unsized 
          constants.</p> 
 
          <p>All constints are automatically created with <a href="ACL2____HONS.html">hons</a>.  This is 
          probably pretty trivial, but it seems nice.  For instance, the 
          constant integers from 0-32 are probably used thousands of times 
          throughout a design for bit-selects and wire ranges, so sharing their 
          memory may be useful.</p>
