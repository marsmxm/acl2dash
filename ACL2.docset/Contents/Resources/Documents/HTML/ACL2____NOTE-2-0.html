<p>ACL2 Version 2.0 (July, 1997) Notes</p><p>This is the first version of ACL2 released under the copyright of 
 the University of Texas (UT).  Future releases of ACL2 will be made from UT 
 rather than Computational Logic, Inc. (CLI).  Version 2.0 is just Version 1.9 
 as released by CLI, with a few bugs fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug causing an infinite loop was fixed in functional instantiation.  The 
 bug manifested itself when two conditions occurred simultaneously: First, the 
 functional substitution replaces a function symbol, e.g., <span class="v">FOO</span>, with a 
 <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> expression containing a free variable (a variable not among in the 
 <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> formals).  And, second, in one of the constraints being 
 instantiated there is a call of the function symbol <span class="v">FOO</span> within the scope 
 of another <span class="v">LAMBDA</span> expression.  Unless you used such a functional 
 substitution, this bug fix will not affect you.</p> 
 
 <p>Less important notes:</p> 
 
 <p>The implementation of <span class="v">PRINC$</span> was changed so that it was no longer 
 sensitive to the external setting of <span class="v">*print-base*</span> and other Common Lisp 
 special variables.</p> 
 
 <p>Typographical errors were fixed in the documentation.</p>
