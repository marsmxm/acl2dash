<p>The Java keywords [JLS:3.9].</p><p>Some character sequences are Java keywords in all contexts, 
     namely the ones listed in the grammar production in [JLS:3.9]. 
     Other character sequences are Java keywords 
     only in certain module-related contexts, 
     as described in [JLS:3.9] in prose (i.e. without grammar productions); 
     these are called `restricted keywords'.</p><p>To avoid conflict or confusion with ACL2 keywords, 
     we prefix <span class="v">keyword</span> with <span class="v">j</span> in ACL2 function and constant names 
     that pertain to Java keywords.</p>
