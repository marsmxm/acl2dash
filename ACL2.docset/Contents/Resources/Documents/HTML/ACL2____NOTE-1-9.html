<p>ACL2 Version 1.9 (Fall, 1996) Notes</p><p>By default, when the system is started it is illegal to use the 
 variable <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> as a formal parameter of a function definition.  The 
 aim is to prevent novice users from stumbling into the Byzantine syntactic 
 restrictions on that variable symbol.  Use</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:set-state-ok t</pre> 
 
 <p>or, equivalently,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SET-STATE-OK.html">set-state-ok</a> t)</pre> 
 
 <p>to switch back to the old default mode.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-STATE-OK.html">set-state-ok</a></p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Set-state-ok</span> is an event that affects the ACL2 defaults table (see 
 <a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a>).  Recall that when books are included, the 
 defaults table is restored to its pre-inclusion state.  Thus, while a 
 <span class="v">set-state-ok</span> form will permit the book to define a <span class="v">state</span>-using 
 function, it will not permit the user of the book to make such a definition. 
 We recommend putting <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-STATE-OK.html">set-state-ok</a> t)</span> in any book that defines a 
 <span class="v">state</span> using function.</p> 
 
 <p>Books certified under Version 1.8 must be recertified under Version 1.9. 
 See :DOC version.</p> 
 
 <p>The simplifier has been made to look out for built-in clauses, whereas in 
 past versions such clauses were only noticed by the ``preprocessor'' at the 
 top of the waterfall.  THIS CHANGE MAY PREVENT OLD SCRIPTS FROM REPLAYING! 
 The undesirable side-effect is caused by the fact that <span class="v">:HINTS</span> require you 
 to refer to clauses by their exact name (see <a href="ACL2____GOAL-SPEC.html">goal-spec</a>) and because the 
 new simplifier proves more clauses than before, the goals produced have 
 different names.  Thus, if a script uses <span class="v">:HINTS</span> that refer to clauses 
 other than "Goal", e.g., "Subgoal 1.3" then the hint may be applied to a 
 different subgoal than originally intended.</p> 
 
 <p>The use of built-in-clauses has been made more efficient.  If a set of 
 clauses arise often in a piece of work, it might be advantageous to build them 
 in even if that results in a large set (hundreds?) of built-in clauses.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____BUILT-IN-CLAUSE.html">built-in-clause</a></p> 
 
 <p>Wormholes can now be used in :logic mode functions. See <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE.html">wormhole</a></p> 
 
 <p>It is now possible to provide ``computed hints.''  For example, have you 
 ever wished to say ``in all goals with a name like this, :use that'' or ``if 
 this term is in the subgoal, then :use that''?  Well, see <a href="ACL2____COMPUTED-HINTS.html">computed-hints</a> and the extraordinarily long example in see <a href="ACL2____USING-COMPUTED-HINTS.html">using-computed-hints</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Hide</span> terms may be rewritten with :rewrite rules about <span class="v">hide</span>.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a>, where we also now explain why <span class="v">hide</span> terms are sometimes 
 introduced into your proof attempts.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug that sometimes caused the ``non-lazy IF'' hard error message was 
 fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug that sometimes caused a hard error in forward chaining was fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug in print-rules (:pr) was fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>We report the use of :executable-counterparts in the evaluation of SYNTAXP 
 forms.</p> 
 
 <p>Some documentation errors were fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug in parent-tree tracking in add-literal-and-pt was fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>A bug in ok$, go$ and eval$ was fixed.</p> 
 
 <p>Clausify now optimizes (mv-nth 'k (list x0 ... xk ... xn)) to xk.</p>
