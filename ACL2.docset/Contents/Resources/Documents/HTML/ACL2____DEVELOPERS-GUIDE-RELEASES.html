<p>Releases</p><p>For ACL2, there are two senses of the notion, ``release''.  This 
 word traditionally referred to numbered releases of ACL2 at the University of 
 Texas, such as Version 8.0, as documented in the <a href="ACL2____RELEASE-NOTES.html">release-notes</a>.  But 
 the ACL2 community increasingly obtains versions of ACL2 from GitHub, at <a href="https://github.com/acl2/acl2" target="_blank"><nobr>https://github.com/acl2/acl2<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://github.com/acl2/acl2"></nobr></a>. 
 These ``releases'' are typically well-tested, though not as thoroughly tested 
 as numbered releases, which (as of this writing) are always tested on Linux 
 using all of the supported Common Lisp implementations, and also tested on 
 Mac.  Even GitHub releases should generally be tested using the 
 ``<span class="v">regression-everything</span>'' target for `<span class="v">make</span>' in the top-level 
 directory, or equivalently, the ``<span class="v">everything</span>'' target in the <span class="v">books/</span> 
 directory.</p> 
 
 <p>There are extensive instructions for doing numbered releases, which as of 
 this writing have not been made public.  Anyone who cares to volunteer to make 
 numbered releases should talk with Matt Kaufmann about obtaining those 
 instructions, which perhaps would become public at that point.  (It could take 
 non-trivial effort to clarify those instructions for the ``public'', so let's 
 wait till there is such a volunteer.)</p>
