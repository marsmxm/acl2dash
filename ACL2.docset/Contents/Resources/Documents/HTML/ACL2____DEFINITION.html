General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> hyp (equiv (fn a1 ... an) body))</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">equiv</span> is an equivalence relation and <span class="v">fn</span> is a function 
 symbol other than <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a></span>.  Such rules allow ``alternative'' definitions of <span class="v">fn</span> to be 
 proved as theorems but used as definitions.  These rules are not true 
 ``definitions'' in the sense that they (a) cannot introduce new function 
 symbols and (b) do not have to be terminating recursion schemes.  They are 
 just conditional rewrite rules that are controlled the same way we control 
 recursive definitions.  We call these ``definition rules'' or ``generalized 
 definitions''.</p> 
 
 <p>Consider the general form above.  Generalized definitions are stored among 
 the <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rules for the function ``defined,'' <span class="v">fn</span> above, 
 but the procedure for applying them is a little different.  During rewriting, 
 instances of <span class="v">(fn a1 ... an)</span> are replaced by corresponding instances of 
 <span class="v">body</span> provided the <span class="v">hyp</span>s can be established as for a <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REWRITE.html">rewrite</a></span> rule and the result of rewriting <span class="v">body</span> satisfies the criteria for 
 function expansion.  There are two primary criteria, either of which permits 
 expansion.  The first is that the ``recursive'' calls of <span class="v">fn</span> in the 
 rewritten body have arguments that already occur in the goal conjecture.  The 
 second is that the ``controlling'' arguments to <span class="v">fn</span> are simpler in the 
 rewritten body.</p> 
 
 <p>The notions of ``recursive call'' and ``controllers'' are complicated by 
 the provisions for mutually recursive definitions.  Consider a ``clique'' of 
 mutually recursive definitions.  Then a ``recursive call'' is a call to any 
 function defined in the clique and an argument is a ``controller'' if it is 
 involved in the measure that decreases in all recursive calls.  These notions 
 are precisely defined by the definitional principle and do not necessarily 
 make sense in the context of generalized definitional equations as implemented 
 here.</p> 
 
 <p>But because the heuristics governing the use of generalized definitions 
 require these notions, it is generally up to the user to specify which calls 
 in body are to be considered recursive and what the controlling arguments are. 
 This information is specified in the <span class="v">:clique</span> and <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> 
 fields of the <span class="v">:definition</span> rule class.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:clique</span> field is the list of function symbols to be considered 
 recursive calls of <span class="v">fn</span>.  In the case of a non-recursive definition, the 
 <span class="v">:clique</span> field is empty; in a singly recursive definition, it should 
 consist of the singleton list containing <span class="v">fn</span>; otherwise it should be a 
 list of all of the functions in the mutually recursive clique with this 
 definition of <span class="v">fn</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If the <span class="v">:clique</span> field is not provided it defaults to <span class="v">nil</span> if 
 <span class="v">fn</span> does not occur as a function symbol in <span class="v">body</span> and it defaults to 
 the singleton list containing <span class="v">fn</span> otherwise.  Thus, <span class="v">:clique</span> must be 
 supplied by the user only when the generalized definition rule is to be 
 treated as one of several in a mutually recursive clique.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> is an alist that maps each function symbol in 
 the <span class="v">:clique</span> to a mask specifying which arguments are considered 
 controllers.  The mask for a given member of the clique, <span class="v">fn</span>, must be a 
 list of <span class="v">t</span>'s and <span class="v">nil</span>'s of length equal to the arity of <span class="v">fn</span>.  A 
 <span class="v">t</span> should be in each argument position that is considered a ``controller'' 
 of the recursion.  For a function admitted under the principle of definition, 
 an argument controls the recursion if it is one of the arguments measured in 
 the termination argument for the function.  But in generalized definition 
 rules, the user is free to designate any subset of the arguments as 
 controllers.  Failure to choose wisely may result in the ``infinite 
 expansion'' of definitional rules but cannot render ACL2 unsound since the 
 rule being misused is a theorem.</p> 
 
 <p>If the <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> is omitted it can sometimes be defaulted 
 automatically by the system.  If the <span class="v">:clique</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>, the 
 <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> defaults to <span class="v">nil</span>.  If the <span class="v">:clique</span> is a 
 singleton containing <span class="v">fn</span>, the <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> defaults to the 
 controller alist computed by <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> fn args body)</span>.  (The user can obtain 
 some control over this analysis by setting the default ruler-extenders; see 
 <a href="ACL2____RULERS.html">rulers</a>.)  If the <span class="v">:clique</span> contains more than one function, the user 
 must supply the <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> specifying the controllers for each 
 function in the clique.  This is necessary since the system cannot determine 
 and thus cannot analyze the other definitional equations to be included in the 
 clique.</p> 
 
 <p>For example, suppose <span class="v">fn1</span> and <span class="v">fn2</span> have been defined one way and it 
 is desired to make ``alternative'' mutually recursive definitions available to 
 the rewriter.  Then one would prove two theorems and store each as a 
 <span class="v">:definition</span> rule.  These two theorems would exhibit equations 
 ``defining'' <span class="v">fn1</span> and <span class="v">fn2</span> in terms of each other.  No provision is 
 here made for exhibiting these two equations as a system of equations.  One is 
 proved and then the other.  It just so happens that the user intends them to 
 be treated as mutually recursive definitions.  To achieve this end, both 
 <span class="v">:definition</span> rules should specify the <span class="v">:clique</span> <span class="v">(fn1 fn2)</span> and 
 should specify a suitable <span class="v">:controller-alist</span>.  If, for example, the new 
 definition of <span class="v">fn1</span> is controlled by its first argument and the new 
 definition of <span class="v">fn2</span> is controlled by its second and third (and they each 
 take three arguments) then a suitable <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> would be <span class="v">((fn1
 t nil nil) (fn2 nil t t))</span>.  The order of the pairs in the alist is 
 unimportant, but there must be a pair for each function in the clique.</p> 
 
 <p>Inappropriate heuristic advice via <span class="v">:clique</span> and <span class="v">:controller-alist</span> 
 can cause ``infinite expansion'' of generalized definitions, but cannot render 
 ACL2 unsound.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the actual definition of <span class="v">fn1</span> has the runic name 
 <span class="v">(:definition fn1)</span>.  The runic name of the alternative definition is 
 <span class="v">(:definition lemma)</span>, where <span class="v">lemma</span> is the name given to the event that 
 created the generalized <span class="v">:definition</span> rule.  This allows theories to switch 
 between various ``definitions'' of the functions.</p> 
 
 <p>By default, a <span class="v">:definition</span> rule establishes the so-called ``body'' of a 
 function.  The body is used by <span class="v">:expand</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>, and it is also used 
 heuristically by the theorem prover's preprocessing (the initial 
 simplification using ``simple'' rules that is controlled by the 
 <span class="v">preprocess</span> symbol in <span class="v">:do-not</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>), induction analysis, and 
 the determination for when to warn about non-recursive functions in rules. 
 The body is also used by some heuristics involving whether a function is 
 recursively defined, and by the <span class="v">expand</span>, <span class="v">x</span>, and <span class="v">x-dumb</span> commands 
 of the interactive <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER.html">proof-builder</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a> for a discussion of the optional field 
 <span class="v">:install-body</span> of <span class="v">:definition</span> rules, which controls whether a 
 <span class="v">:definition</span> rule is used as described in the paragraph above.  Note that 
 even if <span class="v">:install-body nil</span> is supplied, the rewriter will still rewrite 
 with the <span class="v">:definition</span> rule; in that case, ACL2 just won't install a new 
 body for the top function symbol of the left-hand side of the rule, which for 
 example affects the application of <span class="v">:expand</span> hints as described in the 
 preceding paragraph.  Also see <a href="ACL2____SET-BODY.html">set-body</a> and see <a href="ACL2____SHOW-BODIES.html">show-bodies</a> for 
 how to change the body of a function symbol.</p> 
 
 <p>Note only that if you prove a definition rule for function <span class="v">foo</span>, say, 
 <span class="v">foo-new-def</span>, you will need to refer to that definition as 
 <span class="v">foo-new-def</span> or as <span class="v">(:DEFINITION foo-new-def)</span>.  That is because a 
 <span class="v">:definition</span> rule does not change the meaning of the symbol <span class="v">foo</span> for 
 <span class="v">:use</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>, nor does it change the meaning of the symbol <span class="v">foo</span> 
 in theory expressions; see <a href="ACL2____THEORIES.html">theories</a>, in particular the discussion there 
 of runic designators.  Similarly <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a></span> <span class="v">foo</span> and <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PF.html">pf</a></span> <span class="v">foo</span> will still show the original definition of <span class="v">foo</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The definitional principle, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, actually adds <span class="v">:definition</span> 
 rules.  Thus the handling of generalized definitions is exactly the same as 
 for ``real'' definitions because no distinction is made in the implementation. 
 Suppose <span class="v">(fn x y)</span> is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>'d to be <span class="v">body</span>.  Note that <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> (or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUNS.html">defuns</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a></span>) can compute the clique 
 for <span class="v">fn</span> from the syntactic presentation and it can compute the controllers 
 from the termination analysis.  Provided the definition is admissible, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> adds the <span class="v">:definition</span> rule <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (fn x y) body)</span>.</p>
