<p>ACL2 Version  2.8 Notes on Changes in Rules, Definitions, and Constants</p><p>The <a href="ACL2____THEORY.html">theory</a> <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MINIMAL-THEORY.html">minimal-theory</a></span> has been changed by adding 
 the <a href="ACL2____DEFINITION.html">definition</a> <a href="ACL2____RUNE.html">rune</a> for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a></span> to the theory.  A 
 corresponding change has been made to the theory warning mechanism, which was 
 failing to warn if the definition of <span class="v">mv-nth</span> is disabled, even though 
 calls of <span class="v">mv-nth</span> can be expanded by special-purpose code in the rewriter. 
 Thanks to Serita Van Groningen for pointing out this problem with the theory 
 warning mechanism.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFEVALUATOR.html">defevaluator</a></span> event has been modified so that in the body of the 
 evaluator function, to add a new case <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">ATOM</a> X)</span> (returning <span class="v">nil</span>) has 
 been inserted immediately after the case <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">EQ</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X) 'QUOTE)</span>.  This is a 
 no-op semantically but may speed up proofs.  Thanks to Warren Hunt for 
 suggesting this change.</p> 
 
 <p>A new form of <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMPOUND-RECOGNIZER.html">compound-recognizer</a></span> rule is now allowed:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (fn x) concl1 concl2)</pre> 
 
 <p>This is equivalent to an existing form:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (fn x) concl1)
     (<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (fn x)) concl2))</pre> 
 
 <p>Thanks to Josh Purinton for bringing this to our attention.</p> 
 
 <p>Rewrite rules <span class="v">realpart-+</span> and <span class="v">imagpart-+</span> have been added in order 
 to simplify the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____REALPART.html">realpart</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IMAGPART.html">imagpart</a></span> (respectively) of a sum. 
 They follow from a theorem <span class="v">add-def-complex</span> that equates a sum with the 
 complex number formed by adding real and imaginary parts.  All three of these 
 theorems may be found in source file <span class="v">axioms.lisp</span>.  Thanks to Eric Smith 
 for raising a question leading to these additions, as well as to Joe Hendrix 
 and Vernon Austel for helpful suggestions.</p>
