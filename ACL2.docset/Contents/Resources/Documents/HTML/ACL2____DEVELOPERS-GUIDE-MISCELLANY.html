<p>Miscellaneous Information</p><p>The initial version of this chapter is little more than a stub.  It 
 will probably always benefit from expansion to cover more topics.</p> 
 
 <h3>Trust tags</h3> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a> for user-level information about trust tags.  The 
 ``Essay on Trust Tags (Ttags)'' provides a lot of relevant background on trust 
 tags at the implementation level.  A particularly important point to be 
 emphasized here is the following: The critical aspect of trust tags is that 
 whenever a trust tag is activated, the string <span class="v">"TTAG NOTE"</span> must be 
 printed to <span class="v">*standard-co*</span> (see the definition of <span class="v">print-ttag-note</span>), 
 with the exception that if ttag notes are deferred then initially, only the 
 first such is printed; see <a href="ACL2____SET-DEFERRED-TTAG-NOTES.html">set-deferred-ttag-notes</a>.  The paper 
 ``Hacking and Extending ACL2'' from the 2007 ACL2 Workshop may be helpful.</p> 
 
 <h3>Fixnums</h3> 
 
 <p>In general, Common Lisp computations with numbers are much faster when they 
 only deal with ``small'' numbers called <i>fixnums</i>.  See the ``Essay on 
 Fixnum Declarations'' for information about fixnums and ACL2, including a 
 description of the ranges for 32-bit fixnums in different Common Lisp 
 implementations as of this writing.  There may be some opportunities made 
 available by modern Lisps that have 64-bit implementations.  (CMUCL seems to 
 be an exception.)</p> 
 
 <h3>Infix printing is no longer supported</h3> 
 
 <p>At one time ACL2 had support for infix printing, which was used rarely if 
 at all.  Infix code is still present, conditioned by feature <span class="v">:acl2-infix</span>, 
 but it has probably been quite some time since it was tested.  Perhaps it is 
 time to remove all such code; indeed, the release notes for Version 8.0 (see 
 <a href="ACL2____NOTE-8-0.html">note-8-0</a>) say that ``The (minimal) support for infix printing has been 
 removed.''</p>
