<p>Library for reasoning about and computing with integer-encoded truth tables.</p><p>A Boolean function of <span class="v">n</span> variables can be represented using a 
bit vector of <span class="v">2^n</span> bits.  Operators such as AND/OR/XOR can then be computed 
using <span class="v">logand</span>, <span class="v">logior</span>, and <span class="v">logxor</span>, respectively.  This library 
provides utilities for using this encoding of Boolean functions and reasoning 
about them.  It is particularly useful in the <a href="AIGNET____REWRITE.html">aignet::rewrite</a> AIG 
transformation.</p>
