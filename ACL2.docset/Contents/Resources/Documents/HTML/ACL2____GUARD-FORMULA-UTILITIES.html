<p>Utilities that show guard proof obligations</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a> and see <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> for discussions of 
 guards.  Here we discuss several utilities that provide the proof obligations 
 for guards, and briefly compare what is offered by each.  Of course, see the 
 documentation of each utility for details.</p> 
 
 <p>The first pair of utilities captures formulas produced during guard 
 verification.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS-FORMULA.html">Verify-guards-formula</a></span>: Use this to see what the corresponding 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> event prints, but without following through with a proof 
 attempt.  This utility is only for output, without returning an interesting 
 value.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD-OBLIGATION.html">Guard-obligation</a></span>: This function is a programmatic version of the 
 macro, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS-FORMULA.html">verify-guards-formula</a></span>.  It provides the guard obligation as a 
 set of clauses, along with other information.</p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>The second pair of utilities captures the formula provided when a 
 <span class="v">:guard-theorem</span> is supplied for a <span class="v">:use</span> hint.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GTHM.html">Gthm</a></span>: This macro returns a user-level (``untranslated'') 
 representation of the <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">term</a> that is generated for a <span class="v">:guard-theorem</span> 
 <a href="ACL2____LEMMA-INSTANCE.html">lemma-instance</a>.  Options control whether or not simplification and 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD-DEBUG.html">guard-debug</a> are used.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GUARD-THEOREM.html">Guard-theorem</a></span>: This utility is like <a href="ACL2____GTHM.html">gthm</a>, except that it is 
 a function rather than a macro and it returns a translated term (a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a></span>).</p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>We conclude by contrasting these two pairs of utilities.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The first pair can take as input as either a function symbol or a term; 
 for the second pair a function symbol (not a term) is required.</li> 
 
 <li>The level of simplification differs between the two pairs.  See <a href="ACL2____GUARD-SIMPLIFICATION.html">guard-simplification</a> for a detailed explanation; here are highlights.  The 
 first pair simplifies (by default) with respect to the <a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a> 
 before producing the guard proof obligation formula, as is typically done when 
 verifying guards; but the second pair only performs the theory-independent 
 simplification done for a <span class="v">:guard-theorem</span> specified in a <span class="v">:use</span> hint, 
 or if a suitable option is supplied, no simplification at all.</li> 
 
 <li>The two pairs differ in their output <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s: in particular, the 
 utilities in the first pair return multiple values while those in the second 
 pair return a single value.</li> 
 
 </ul>
