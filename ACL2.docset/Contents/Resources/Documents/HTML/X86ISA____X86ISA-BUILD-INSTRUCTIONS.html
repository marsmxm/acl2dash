<p>Building books related to the x86 ISA and the machine-code 
  analysis framework</p><p>Some ways of building the <span class="v">x86isa</span> books are:</p> 
 
 <ol> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>Using <span class="v">cert.pl top</span>: This <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a> option should work well 
 for most users.  Users who want to execute programs that utilize <span class="v">SYSCALL</span>, 
 <span class="v">RDRAND</span>, etc. should consider the option listed below.</p> 
 </li> 
 
 <li> 
 <p>Using the Makefile provided with the <span class="v">x86isa</span> books: Users of these 
 books who wish to simulate x86 programs with non-deterministic computations 
 like <span class="v">SYSCALL</span> (in <a href="X86ISA____APP-VIEW.html">app-view</a>) should use the Makefile provided with 
 <span class="v">x86isa</span> and run make with <span class="v">X86ISA_EXEC</span> set to <span class="v">t</span> (which is the 
 default value).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">make JOBS=8 \ 
     X86ISA_EXEC=t \ 
     ACL2=/Users/shilpi/acl2/saved_acl2 
</pre> 
 <p>where the number of jobs to be run in parallel in this example is 
 8.  Note that we use <span class="v">JOBS</span> here instead of the <span class="v">-j</span> flag.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">X86ISA_EXEC</span> is <span class="v">t</span>, some dynamic C libraries that are 
 used in the model for supporting the execution of <span class="v">SYSCALL</span> in the 
 application-level view will be built.  <b>Since we rely on the foreign 
 function interface of <a href="http://ccl.clozure.com/" target="_blank"><nobr>Clozure 
 CL<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://ccl.clozure.com/"></nobr></a> (CCL), full execution support is available only if you use 
 CCL.</b></p> 
 
 <p>Values of <span class="v">X86ISA_EXEC</span> other than <span class="v">t</span> will not allow the 
 execution of <span class="v">SYSCALL</span> instructions (as may be the case with 
 using other Lisps as well).  Note that reasoning about these 
 instructions will still be possible.  Execution and reasoning about 
 all other instructions will always be possible, irrespective of 
 <span class="v">X86ISA_EXEC</span> or the underlying Lisp.</p> 
 
 <p><b>IMPORTANT:</b> You should do a "make clean" (or "make 
 execclean" if you are in a hurry) if you wish to certify the books 
 with a different value of <span class="v">X86ISA_EXEC</span>.</p> 
 
 </li> 
 
 <li> <p>Using the "everything" target of the ACL2 Community 
 Books (see acl2/books/GNUmakefile): This is essentially the same as 
 executing <span class="v">cert.pl books/projects/x86isa/top</span>. This will build the 
 x86 books without full execution support, i.e., the effect will be 
 the same as building these books with <span class="v">X86ISA_EXEC=nil</span>, even 
 though the Makefile provided with the <span class="v">x86isa</span> books will not be 
 used.</p> </li> 
 
 </ol> 
 
 <p>Suppose you had certified these books previously, but you have 
 since forgotten whether you built them with <span class="v">X86ISA_EXEC=t</span> or not. 
 Here is a way of checking the certified books to see if you have full 
 execution support. Look at the following file: 
 <span class="v">machine/syscalls.cert.out</span>. If this file contains the 
 following: </p> 
 
 <pre class="code">X86ISA_EXEC Warning: environment-and-syscalls-raw.lsp is not 
 included.</pre> 
 
 <p>then you do <i>not</i> have <span class="v">SYSCALL</span> execution support. 
 Otherwise, you do.</p>
