 <p>On this tour you will learn a little more about the ACL2 logic, the theorem 
 prover, and the user interface.</p> 
 
 <p>This time we will stick with really simple things, such as the 
 associativity of list concatenation.</p> 
 
 <p>We assume you have taken the Flying Tour but that you did not necessarily 
 follow all the ``off-tour'' links because we encouraged you not to.  With the 
 Walking Tour we encourage you to visit off-tour links  provided they 
 are not marked with the tiny warning sign (<a href="ACL2____A_02Tiny_02Warning_02Sign.html"><img src="../res/tours/twarning.gif"></a>). 
 But they are ``branches'' in the tour that lead to ``dead ends.''  When you 
 reach a dead end, remember to use your browser's Back Button to return to the 
 Walking Tour to continue.</p> 
 
 <p>When you get to the end of the tour we'll give you a chance to repeat 
 quickly both the Flying and the Walking Tours to visit any off-tour links 
 still of interest.</p>
