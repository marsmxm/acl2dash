<p>Initiate the printing of profiling information to view in Emacs</p><p>The following example from Bob Boyer shows how to use this 
 feature.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">acl2
(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/memoize/old/watch" :dir :system :ttags :all)
:q
(<a href="ACL2____WATCH.html">watch</a>)</pre> 
 
 <p>The output at the terminal will show a file name such as 
 <span class="v">"watch-output-temp-8916.lsp"</span>.  Bring that file into an Emacs buffer and 
 evaluate m-x auto-revert-mode.  Then, back in ACL2:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a>)
(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t)) x)
(<a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE.html">memoize</a> 'foo)
(foo 1)
(foo 1)
(foo 2)</pre> 
 
 <p>You can look at the above ``temporary'' file and see some interesting 
 information related to features provided by your <a href="ACL2____HONS-ENABLED.html">hons-enabled</a> ACL2 
 executable.  For a further experiment, continue in ACL2 as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:q
(<a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ACL2.html">profile-acl2</a>) ; could take a minute or more
(<a href="ACL2____LP.html">lp</a>)
:mini-proveall</pre> 
 
 <p>The buffer for the above file will now provide reports on the 20 functions 
 that used the most time during the <span class="v">:mini-proveall</span> evaluation, among the 
 newly-profiled ACL2 functions.  In raw Lisp, you can evaluate <span class="v">(setq
 *memoize-summary-limit* 100)</span> to see the most time-using 100 functions (for 
 example).</p> 
 
 <p>The documentation below was directly derived from a Lisp documentation 
 string formerly in <span class="v">books/centaur/memoize/old/watch-raw.lsp</span>.  The ACL2 
 community is invited to format it, modify it, etc.  More documentation may be 
 found in the above <span class="v">watch-raw.lsp</span> file.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">WATCH is a raw Lisp function that initiates the printing of
profiling information.  (<a href="ACL2____WATCH.html">WATCH</a>) sets *WATCH-FILE* to the string that
results from the evaluation of *WATCH-FILE-FORM*, a string that is
to be the name of a file we call the 'watch file'.

In Clozure Common Lisp, (<a href="ACL2____WATCH.html">WATCH</a>) also initiates the periodic
evaluation of (WATCH-DUMP), which evaluates the members of the list
*WATCH-FORMS*, but diverts characters for *STANDARD-OUTPUT* to the
watch file.  The value of *WATCH-FILE* is returned by both (<a href="ACL2____WATCH.html">WATCH</a>)
and (WATCH-DUMP).  (WATCH-KILL) ends the periodic printing to the
watch file.

You are most welcome to, even encouraged to, change the members of
*WATCH-FORMS* to have your desired output written to the watch file.

Often (<a href="ACL2____MEMOIZE-SUMMARY.html">MEMOIZE-SUMMARY</a>) is a member of *WATCH-FORMS*.  It prints
information about calls of memoized and/or profiled functions.

Often (PRINT-CALL-STACK) is a member of *WATCH-FORMS*.  It shows the
names of memoized and/or profiled functions that are currently in
execution and how long they have been executing.

We suggest the following approach for getting profiling information
about calls to Common Lisp functions:

  0. Invoke (<a href="ACL2____WATCH.html">WATCH</a>).

  1. Profile some functions that have been defined.

     For example, call (PROFILE-FN 'foo1), ...

     Or, for example, call PROFILE-FILE on the name of a file that
     contains the definitions of some functions that have been
     defined.

     Or, as a perhaps extreme example, invoke
     (<a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ACL2.html">PROFILE-ACL2</a>), which will profile many of the functions that
     have been introduced to ACL2, but may take a minute or two.

     Or, as a very extreme example, invoke
     (<a href="ACL2____PROFILE-ALL.html">PROFILE-ALL</a>), which will profile many functions, but may take
     a minute or two.

  2. Run a Lisp computation of interest to you that causes some of
     the functions you have profiled to be executed.

  3. Invoke (WATCH-DUMP).

  4. Examine, perhaps in Emacs, the watch file, whose name was
     returned by (WATCH-DUMP).  The watch file contains information
     about the behavior of the functions you had profiled or
     memoized during the computation of interest.

From within ACL2, you may MEMOIZE any of your ACL2 Common Lisp
compliant ACL2 functions.  One might MEMOIZE a function that is
called repeatedly on the exact same arguments.  Deciding which
functions to memoize is tricky.  The information from (WATCH-DUMP)
helps.  Sometimes, we are even led to radically recode some of our
functions so that they will behave better when memoized.

In Emacs, the command 'M-X AUTO-REVERT-MODE' toggles auto-revert
mode, i.e., causes a buffer to exit auto-revert mode if it is in
auto-revert mode, or to enter auto-revert mode if it is not.  In
other words, to stop a buffer from being auto-reverted, simply
toggle auto-revert mode; toggle it again later if you want more
updating.  'M-X AUTO-REVERT-MODE' may be thought of as a way of
telling Emacs, 'keep the watch buffer still'.

In Clozure Common Lisp, if the FORCE-DOG argument to WATCH (<a href="ACL2____DEFAULT.html">default</a>
NIL) is non-NIL or if (LIVE-TERMINAL-P) is non-NIL a 'watch dog'
thread is created to periodically call (WATCH-DUMP).  The thread is
the value of *WATCH-DOG-PROCESS*.
