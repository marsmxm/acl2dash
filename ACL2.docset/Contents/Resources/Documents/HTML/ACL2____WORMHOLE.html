 <p>The keyword arguments above are exactly those of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> (see <a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a>) 
 except that three of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span>'s keyword arguments are missing: the three 
 that specify the channels <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-OI.html">standard-oi</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STANDARD-CO.html">standard-co</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROOFS-CO.html">proofs-co</a></span>, which default in <span class="v">wormhole</span> to ACL2's comment window.</p> 
 
 <p>There are two ways to create and enter a wormhole: <span class="v">wormhole</span> as 
 described here and the simpler <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a></span>.  We recommend you read 
 this full account of wormholes before using <span class="v">wormhole-eval</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Ignoring the use of <span class="v">entry-lambda</span>, <span class="v">wormhole</span> manufactures a named 
 ``wormhole <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a>'' and calls the general-purpose ACL2 read-eval-print 
 loop <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> on it.  However, when <span class="v">ld</span> exits, the wormhole evaporates 
 and the function <span class="v">wormhole</span> returns <span class="v">nil</span>.  The manufactured state is 
 like the ``current'' ACL2 <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> except for two things.  First, some 
 information from the last wormhole state of this name is transferred into the 
 new state; this allows a wormhole to maintain some state from one call to the 
 next.  Second, some information from the wormhole call itself is transferred 
 into the new state; this allows the wormhole to be sensitive to context. 
 These two changes to the current state are reflected in the settings <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>
 wormhole-status)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> wormhole-input)</span> discussed in detail below.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="v">wormhole</span> may be called from environments in which <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> is not bound.  It is still applicative because it always returns 
 <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>There are some restrictions about what can be done inside a wormhole.  As 
 you may imagine, we really do not ``copy the current state'' but rather just 
 keep track of how we modified it and undo those modifications upon exit.  In 
 particular, when exiting a wormhole, values of state globals (see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING-WITH-STATE.html">programming-with-state</a>) are restored to their values at the time the wormhole 
 was entered.  Note that information about traced functions is stored in state 
 globals (see <a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a>); accordingly, all tracing and untracing done 
 inside a wormhole is undone upon exit from the wormhole.</p> 
 
 <p>An error is signaled if you try to modify state in an unsupported way. 
 For this same reason, wormholes do not allow updating of any user-defined 
 single-threaded objects.  See <a href="ACL2____STOBJ.html">stobj</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>One example wormhole is the implementation of the ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">accumulated-persistence</a></span> facility for tracking the frequency with which rules 
 are tried.  To implement this feature directly the theorem prover would have 
 to take the tracking data as an argument and pass it around so that updates 
 could be accumulated.  This would greatly clutter the code.  Instead, the 
 tracking data is maintained in a wormhole.  The theorem prover enters the 
 wormhole to update the data as rules are tried.  When you request a display of 
 the data, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SHOW-ACCUMULATED-PERSISTENCE.html">show-accumulated-persistence</a></span> enters the wormhole and prints 
 the data.  But the data is never available outside that wormhole.  The ACL2 
 system uses a second wormhole to implement the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR.html">brr</a></span> facility, allowing 
 the user to interact with the rewriter as rules are applied.</p> 
 
 <p>We now specify the arguments and behavior of <span class="v">wormhole</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">name</span> argument must be a quoted constant and is typically a symbol. 
 It will be the ``name'' of the wormhole.  A wormhole of that name will be 
 created the first time either <span class="v">wormhole</span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a></span> is 
 called.</p> 
 
 <p>Every wormhole name has a ``status.''  The status of a wormhole is stored 
 outside of ACL2; it is inaccessible to the ACL2 user except when in the named 
 wormhole.  But the status of a wormhole may be set by the user from within the 
 wormhole.</p> 
 
 <p>Upon the first call of <span class="v">wormhole</span> or <span class="v">wormhole-eval</span> on a name, the 
 status of that name is <span class="v">nil</span>.  But in general you should arrange for the 
 status to be a cons.  The status is set by the quoted <span class="v">lambda</span> every time 
 <span class="v">wormhole</span> is called; but it may also be set in the <span class="v">form</span> argument (the 
 first form evaluated in the interactive loop) by assigning to the state global 
 variable <span class="v">wormhole-status</span>, as with</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> wormhole-status ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>or even by the user interacting with the loop if you do not exit the loop 
 with the first form.  The <span class="v">car</span> of the cons should be either <span class="v">:ENTER</span> or 
 <span class="v">:SKIP</span> and is called the wormhole's ``entry code.''  The entry code of 
 <span class="v">nil</span> or an unexpectedly shaped status is <span class="v">:ENTER</span>.  The <span class="v">cdr</span> of the 
 cons is arbitrary data maintained by you.</p> 
 
 <p>When <span class="v">wormhole</span> is invoked, the status of the specified name is 
 incorporated into the manufactured wormhole state.  In particular, inside the 
 wormhole, the status is the value of the state global variable 
 <span class="v">wormhole-status</span>.  That is, inside the wormhole, the status may be 
 accessed by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> wormhole-status)</span> and set by <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> wormhole-status
 ...)</span>, <span class="v">f-get-global</span> and <span class="v">f-put-global</span>.  When <span class="v">ld</span> exits — 
 typically because the form <span class="v">:q</span> was read by <span class="v">ld</span> — the 
 then-current value of wormhole-status is hidden away so that it can be 
 restored when this wormhole is entered again.  The rest of the wormhole state 
 is lost.</p> 
 
 <p>This allows a sequence of entries and exits to a wormhole to maintain some 
 history in the status and this information can be manipulated by ACL2 
 functions executing inside the wormhole.</p> 
 
 <p>The second argument to <span class="v">wormhole</span> must be a quoted lambda expression. 
 We explain it later.</p> 
 
 <p>The third argument, <span class="v">input</span>, may be any term.  The value of the term is 
 passed into the manufactured wormhole state, allowing you to pass in 
 information about the calling context.  Inside the wormhole, the <span class="v">input</span> is 
 available via <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> wormhole-input)</span>.  It could be reassigned via <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a>
 wormhole-input ...)</span>, but there is no reason to do that.</p> 
 
 <p>The fourth argument, <span class="v">form</span>, may be any term; when <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> is called 
 on the manufactured wormhole state, the first form evaluated by <span class="v">ld</span> will 
 be the value of <span class="v">form</span>.  Note that <span class="v">form</span> will be translated by <span class="v">ld</span>. 
 Errors, including guard violations, in the translation or execution of that 
 first form will leave you in the interactive loop of the wormhole state.</p> 
 
 <p>When used properly, the first form allows you to greet your user before 
 reading the first interactive command or simply to do whatever computation you 
 want to do inside the wormhole and exit silently.  We give examples below.</p> 
 
 <p>Manufacturing a wormhole state is relatively expensive; in addition, the 
 forms executed by <span class="v">ld</span> must be read, translated, and interpreted as with 
 any user type-in.  The <span class="v">entry-lambda</span> offers a way to avoid this or, at 
 least, to decide whether to incur that expense.</p> 
 
 <p>Before the wormhole state is manufactured and entered, the 
 <span class="v">entry-lambda</span> is applied to the current wormhole status with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a></span>.  That <span class="v">lambda</span> application must produce a new wormhole 
 status, which is stored as the wormhole's status.  The entry code for the new 
 status determines whether <span class="v">wormhole</span> actually manufactures a wormhole state 
 and calls <span class="v">ld</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If the entry code for that new status is <span class="v">:ENTER</span> the wormhole state is 
 manufactured and entered; otherwise, the new status is simply saved as the 
 most recent status but the wormhole state is not manufactured or entered. 
 Note therefore that the <span class="v">entry-lambda</span> may be used to perform two 
 functions: (a) to determine if it is really necessary to manufacture a state 
 and (b) to update the data in the wormhole status as a function of the old 
 status without invoking <span class="v">ld</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">entry-lambda</span> must be a quoted lambda expression of at most one 
 argument.  Thus, the argument must be either</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">'(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (whs) &lt;body&gt;)</pre> 
 
 <p>or</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">'(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> () &lt;body&gt;)</pre> 
 
 <p>Note the quote.  If a formal, e.g., <span class="v">whs</span>, is provided, it must be used 
 as a variable in the <span class="v">lambda</span> body.  The <span class="v">lambda</span>-expression may contain 
 free variables, that is, the body may mention variables other than the 
 <span class="v">lambda</span> formal.  These free variables are understood in the caller's 
 environment.  These conventions allow us to compile the <span class="v">entry-lambda</span> 
 application very efficiently when the guard has been verified.</p> 
 
 <p>The guard on a call of <span class="v">wormhole</span> is the conjunction of the guards on 
 the arguments conjoined with the guard on the body of the <span class="v">entry-lambda</span>. 
 See <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a> for a discussion of the guard on the 
 <span class="v">lambda</span>-expression.</p> 
 
 <p>The functions <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-STATUSP.html">wormhole-statusp</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-ENTRY-CODE.html">wormhole-entry-code</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-DATA.html">wormhole-data</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-WORMHOLE-ENTRY-CODE.html">set-wormhole-entry-code</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-WORMHOLE-DATA.html">set-wormhole-data</a></span>, 
 and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MAKE-WORMHOLE-STATUS.html">make-wormhole-status</a></span> may be useful in manipulating entry codes and 
 data in the <span class="v">entry-lambda</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that you access and manipulate the wormhole's status in two different 
 ways depending on whether you're ``outside'' of the wormhole applying the 
 quoted <span class="v">lambda</span> or ``inside'' the read-eval-print loop of the wormhole.</p> 
 
 <p>OUTSIDE (<span class="v">wormhole-eval</span>): access via the value of the <span class="v">lambda</span> 
 formal and set by returning the new status as the value of the <span class="v">lambda</span> 
 body.</p> 
 
 <p>INSIDE (<span class="v">ld</span> phase of <span class="v">wormhole</span>): access via <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a>
 wormhole-status)</span>, and set via <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ASSIGN.html">assign</a> wormhole-status ...)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Pragmatic Advice on Designing a Wormhole: Suppose you are using wormholes 
 to implement some extra-logical utility.  You must contemplate how you will 
 use your wormhole's status to store hidden information.  You might be tempted 
 to exploit the entry code as part of the status.  For example, you may think 
 of <span class="v">:ENTER</span> as indicating that your utility is ``turned on'' and <span class="v">:SKIP</span> 
 as indicating that your utility is ``turned off.''  We advise against such a 
 design.  We recommend you base your decisions on the wormhole data.  We 
 recommend that you set but not read the wormhole entry code to signal whether 
 you wish to enter a full-fledged wormhole.  To use the entry code as a flag 
 overloads it and invites confusion when your facility is ``turned off'' but 
 you have to enter the wormhole for some reason.</p> 
 
 <p>For a behind-the-scenes description of how wormholes work, See <a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-IMPLEMENTATION.html">wormhole-implementation</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here are some sample situations handled by <span class="v">wormhole-eval</span> and 
 <span class="v">wormhole</span>.  Let the wormhole in question be named <span class="v">DEMO</span>.  Initially 
 its status is <span class="v">NIL</span>.  The functions below all maintain the convention that 
 the status is either <span class="v">nil</span> or of the form <span class="v">(:key . lst)</span>, where 
 <span class="v">:key</span> is either <span class="v">:SKIP</span> or <span class="v">:ENTER</span> and <span class="v">lst</span> is a true-list of 
 arbitrary objects.  But since there is no way to prevent the user from 
 entering the <span class="v">DEMO</span> wormhole interactively and doing something to the 
 status, this convention cannot be enforced.  Thus, the functions below do what 
 we say they do, e.g., remember all the values of <span class="v">x</span> ever seen, only if 
 they're the only functions messing with the <span class="v">DEMO</span> status.  On the other 
 hand, the guards of all the functions below can be verified.  We have 
 explicitly declared that the guards on the functions below are to be verified, 
 to confirm that they can be.  Guard verification is optional but wormholes 
 (and <span class="v">wormhole-eval</span> in particular) are more efficient when guards have 
 been verified.  All of the functions defined below return <span class="v">nil</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The examples below build on each other.  If you really want to understand 
 wormholes we recommend that you evaluate each of the forms below, in the order 
 they are discussed.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Q.</b> How do I create a wormhole that prints its status to the comment 
 window?</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> demo-status ()
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :verify-guards t))
  (<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a> 'demo
                 '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (whs)
                    (<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (<a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a> "DEMO status:~%~x0~%" whs)
                            whs))
                 nil))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note above that after printing the status to the comment window we return 
 the new (unchanged) status <span class="v">whs</span>.  Had we just written the call of <span class="v">cw</span>, 
 which returns <span class="v">nil</span>, the function would print the status and then set it to 
 <span class="v">nil</span>!</p> 
 
 <p><b>Q.</b> How do I use a wormhole to collect every symbol, <span class="v">x</span>, passed 
 to the function?</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> demo-collect (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :verify-guards t))
  (<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a> 'demo
                 '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (whs)
                    (<a href="ACL2____MAKE-WORMHOLE-STATUS.html">make-wormhole-status</a> whs
                                          (<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-ENTRY-CODE.html">wormhole-entry-code</a> whs)
                                          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> x)
                                              (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x (<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-DATA.html">wormhole-data</a> whs))
                                              (<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-DATA.html">wormhole-data</a> whs))))
                 nil))</pre> 
 
 <p>We could have also defined this function this way:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> demo-collect (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :verify-guards t))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> x)
      (<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-EVAL.html">wormhole-eval</a> 'demo
                     '(<a href="COMMON-LISP____LAMBDA.html">lambda</a> (whs)
                        (<a href="ACL2____SET-WORMHOLE-DATA.html">set-wormhole-data</a> whs
                                           (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x (<a href="ACL2____WORMHOLE-DATA.html">wormhole-data</a> whs))))
                     nil)
      nil))</pre> 
 
 <p>Both versions always return <span class="v">nil</span> and both versions collect into the 
 wormhole data field just the symbols <span class="v">x</span> upon which <span class="v">demo-collect</span> is 
 called.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Q.</b> How do I use <span class="v">demo-collect</span>?  Below is a function that maps 
 over a list and computes its length.  But it has been annotated with a call to 
 <span class="v">demo-collect</span> on every element.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> my-len (lst)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ENDP.html">endp</a> lst)
      0
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP_____B2.html">+</a> 1
         (<a href="ACL2____PROG2_42.html">prog2$</a> (demo-collect (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> lst))
                 (my-len (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> lst))))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Thus, for example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(my-len '(4 temp car "Hi" rfix))
5
ACL2 !&gt;(demo-status)
DEMO status:
(:ENTER RFIX CAR TEMP)
NIL
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p><b>Q.</b> How do I set the entry code to <span class="v">:ENTER</span> or <span class="v">:SKIP</span> 
 according to whether <span class="v">name</span> is a <span class="v">member-equal</span> of the list of things 
 seen so far?  Note that we cannot check this condition outside the wormhole, 
 because it depends on the list of things collected so far.  We make the 
 decision inside the <span class="v">lambda</span>-expression.  Note that we explicitly check 
 that the guard of <span class="v">member-equal</span> is satisfied by the current wormhole 
 status, since we cannot rely on the invariant that no other function 
 interferes with the status of the <span class="v">DEMO</span> wormhole.  In the case that the 
 status is ``unexpected'' we act like the status is <span class="v">nil</span> and set it to 
 <span class="v">(:SKIP . NIL)</span>.</p>

 has an <span class="v">ABSOLUTE-EVENT-NUMBER</span> property in the ACL2 logical world, print 
 the defining event with <span class="v">:pe</span> and then enter an interactive loop; but if 
 the symbol does not have an <span class="v">ABSOLUTE-EVENT-NUMBER</span>, don't print anything 
 and don't enter an interactive loop.</p> 
 
 <p>Here it is not important to know what <span class="v">ABSOLUTE-EVENT-NUMBER</span> is; this 
 example just shows that we can use a wormhole to access the ACL2 logical 
 world, even in a function that does not take the state as an argument.</p> 
 
 <p>In the code below, we use <span class="v">wormhole</span> instead of <span class="v">wormhole-eval</span>, 
 because we might have to access the logical world and enter an interactive 
 loop.  But for efficiency we do as much as we can inside the entry 
 <span class="v">lambda</span>, where we can check whether <span class="v">x</span> is symbol and collect it into 
 the data field of the wormhole status.  Note that if we collect <span class="v">x</span>, we 
 also set the entry code to <span class="v">:ENTER</span>.  If we don't collect <span class="v">x</span>, we set 
 the entry code to <span class="v">:SKIP</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(defun collect-symbols-and-print-events (x) 
  (declare (xargs :guard t)) 
  (wormhole 'demo 
            '(lambda (whs) 
               (if (symbolp x) 
                   (make-wormhole-status whs 
                                         :ENTER 
                                         (cons x (wormhole-data whs))) 
                   (set-wormhole-entry-code whs :SKIP))) 
 
; The wormhole will not get past here is unless the entry code is 
; :ENTER.  If we get past here, we manufacture a state, put 
; x into <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> wormhole-input)</span> and call ld in such a way that the 
; first form executed is the quoted if-expression below. 
 
            x 
            '(if (getpropc (@ wormhole-input) 'absolute-event-number) 
                 (er-progn 
                  (mv-let (col state) 
                          (fmt "~%Entering a wormhole on the event name ~x0~%" 
                               (list (cons #\0 (@ wormhole-input))) 
                               *standard-co* state nil) 
                          (declare (ignore col)) 
                          (value nil)) 
                  (pe (@ wormhole-input)) 
                  (set-ld-prompt 'wormhole-prompt state) 
                  (value :invisible)) 
                 (value :q)) 
            :ld-verbose nil 
            :ld-prompt nil)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>The ``first form'' (the <span class="v">if</span>) asks whether the <span class="v">wormhole-input</span> 
 (i.e., <span class="v">x</span>) has an <span class="v">ABSOLUTE-EVENT-NUMBER</span> property.  If so, it enters 
 an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ER-PROGN.html">er-progn</a></span> to perform a sequence of commands, each of which returns 
 an ACL2 error triple (see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING-WITH-STATE.html">programming-with-state</a>).  The first form uses 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FMT.html">fmt</a></span> to print a greeting.  Since <span class="v">fmt</span> returns <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> col state)</span> 
 and we must return an error triple, we embed the <span class="v">fmt</span> term in an 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a> (col state) ... (<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> nil))</span>.  The macro <span class="v">value</span> takes an 
 object and returns a ``normal return'' error triple.  The second form in the 
 <span class="v">er-progn</span> uses the ACL2 history macro <span class="v">pe</span> (see <a href="ACL2____PE.html">pe</a>) to print the 
 defining event for a name.  The third form sets the prompt of this 
 read-eval-print loop to the standard function for printing the wormhole 
 prompt.  We silenced the printing of the prompt when we called <span class="v">ld</span>, thanks 
 to the <span class="v">:ld-prompt nil</span> keyword option.  More on this below.  The fourth 
 form returns the error triple value <span class="v">:invisible</span> as the value of the first 
 form.  This prevents <span class="v">ld</span> from printing the value of the first form.  Since 
 we have not exited <span class="v">ld</span>, that function just continues by reading the next 
 form from the comment window.  The user perceives this as entering a 
 read-eval-print loop.  We continue in the loop until the user types 
 <span class="v">:q</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>On the other branch of the <span class="v">if</span>, if the symbol has no 
 <span class="v">ABSOLUTE-EVENT-NUMBER</span> property, we execute the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VALUE.html">value</a> :q)</span>, 
 which is the programming equivalent of typing <span class="v">:q</span>.  That causes the 
 <span class="v">ld</span> to exit.</p> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">ld</span> special variables set in the call to <span class="v">wormhole</span> and further 
 manipulated inside the first form to <span class="v">ld</span> may require explanation.  By 
 setting <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-VERBOSE.html">ld-verbose</a></span> to <span class="v">nil</span>, we prevent <span class="v">ld</span> from printing 
 the familiar ACL2 banner when <span class="v">ld</span> is called.  If <span class="v">:ld-verbose nil</span> is 
 deleted, then you would see something like</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Version  4.0.  Level 2.
...
Type (<a href="ACL2____GOOD-BYE.html">good-bye</a>) to quit completely out of ACL2.</pre> 
 
 <p>before the first form is read and evaluated.</p> 
 
 <p>By setting <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD-PROMPT.html">ld-prompt</a></span> to <span class="v">nil</span> we prevent <span class="v">ld</span> from 
 printing the prompt before reading and evaluating the first form.</p> 
 
 <p>As this example shows, to use full-blown wormholes you must understand the 
 protocol for using wormhole status to control whether a wormhole state is 
 manufactured for <span class="v">ld</span> and you must also understand programming with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span> and the effects of the various <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LD.html">ld</a></span> ``special variables.''</p> 
 
 <p>From the discussion above we see that wormholes can be used to create 
 formatted output without passing in the ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a></span>.  For examples see 
 <a href="ACL2____CW.html">cw</a>, in particular the discussion at the end of that documentation 
 topic.</p>
