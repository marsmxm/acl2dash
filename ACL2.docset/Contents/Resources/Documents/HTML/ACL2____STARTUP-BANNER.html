<p>Modifying the ACL2 startup banner</p><p>When you start up an ACL2 executable built from sources obtained 
  from GitHub between ACL2 releases, you'll typically see a startup banner like 
  this:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ ACL2 Version 8.3+ (a development snapshot based on ACL2 Version 8.3) +
+   built April 21, 2021  15:56:37.                                    +
+   (Git commit hash: 41bb85ab9dbf5ac7d4ed246847db8934b6a48f92)        +
+ Copyright (C) 2021, Regents of the University of Texas.              +

+ details, see the LICENSE file distributed with ACL2.                 +
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</pre> 
 
 <p>The third line of that banner can be modified by setting environment 
 variable <span class="v">ACL2_SNAPSHOT_INFO</span> to a non-empty string before saving the 
 executable.  The value of that variable will be placed into the banner, for 
 example as follows if that value is <span class="v">"This is my private
 executable."</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
+ ACL2 Version 8.3+ (a development snapshot based on ACL2 Version 8.3) +
+   built April 21, 2021  15:56:37.                                    +
+   (Note from the environment when this executable was saved:         +
+    This is my private executable.)                                   +

 <p>An exception is the special value, <span class="v">"none"</span>, which is treated as 
 case-insensitive (so it can similarly be <span class="v">"None"</span>, <span class="v">"NONE"</span>, etc.). 
 In that case, the third line of the original banner is omitted entirely.</p>
