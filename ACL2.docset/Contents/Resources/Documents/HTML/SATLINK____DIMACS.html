<p>DIMACS format is a standard interface to SAT solvers.</p><p>Many SAT solvers accept a common format for input and output that 
is used in SAT solving competititons; <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html" target="_blank"><nobr> 
this page<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.satcompetition.org/2009/format-benchmarks2009.html"></nobr></a> gives the competitions' official description.</p> 
 
<p>The basic input format is as follows.  At the top you can have <i>comment 
lines</i> that start with a <span class="v">c</span>, like this:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">c This line is a comment.</pre> 
 
<p>Then comes the <i>problem line</i>, which starts with a <span class="v">p</span> and then says 
how many variables and clauses there are.  For instance, here is a problem line 
that says this is a CNF problem with 3 variables and 4 clauses:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">p cnf 3 4</pre> 
 
<p>Finally the clauses are listed.  Each clause is represented as a list of 
numbers like <span class="v">3</span> and <span class="v">-42</span>.  A positive number like <span class="v">3</span> represents a 
positive occurrence of variable 3.  A negative number like <span class="v">-42</span> represents 
a negated occurrence of variable 42.</p> 
 
<p>The number <span class="v">0</span> is treated in a special way: it is not a variable, but 
instead marks the end of each clause.  This allows a single clause to be split 
up over multiple lines.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Input Format Questions and <i>Clean</i> Formulas</h3> 
 
<p>If we could be sure the above document was the standard, we could very 
easily convert from our <a href="SATLINK____CNF.html">cnf</a> representation into it.  The only twist is 
that 0 isn't a valid identifier in DIMACS format, but it is a valid identifier 
in our representation.  To get around this, we can just add one to every 
variable number throughout the problem.</p> 
 
<p>However, the SAT competitions generally use a simplified version of the 
DIMACS format.  For instance, the 2012 SAT competititon used the same <a href="http://www.satcompetition.org/2011/rules.pdf" target="_blank"><nobr>rules<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.satcompetition.org/2011/rules.pdf"></nobr></a> as the 2011 
competititon and for previous years, and restrict the format so that the 
solver may assume:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Each variable, from 1 to the number of variables specified on the problem 
line, is used at least once in some clause.</li> 
 
<li>The clauses are distinct and may not simultaneously contain opposite 
literals.</li> 
 
<li>There are exactly the right number of clauses given in the problem 
line.</li> 
 
<li>Clauses are kept on the same line.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>It appears that the rules do not rule out empty clauses.</p> 
 
<p><b>BOZO</b> Eventually, we would like to make sure we produce DIMACS files 
that conform to these more stringent requirements, since otherwise a SAT solver 
that believes it can make these assumptions may make a mistake.  We may 
eventually add a cleaning phase to our SAT integration, to ensure that we only 
call the SAT solver on "clean" formulas.</p>
