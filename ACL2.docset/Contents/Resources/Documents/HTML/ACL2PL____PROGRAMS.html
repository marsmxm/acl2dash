<p>A formalization of ACL2 programs.</p><p>For now we formalize an ACL2 program as consisting of 
     a list of packages and a set of functions. 
     This should suffice for our initial purposes, 
     but we will extend this notion of ACL2 program as needed.</p><p>This notion of program captures 
     part of the ACL2 environment in which ACL2 code executes. 
     The list of packages captures the package definitions, 
     in the order in which they appear in the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>. 
     The set of functions captures the function definitions, 
     without considering their order in the ACL2 <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>; 
     note that, due to mutually recursive functions, 
     we do not quite have a total ordering on functions in the <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a>, 
     but rather a total ordering of mutually recursive function cliques.</p>
