<p>Check for assignments with the same right-hand side.</p><p>This is a trivially simple check for cases like:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">assign a = rhs;
assign b = rhs;</pre> 
 
<p>That is, where <span class="v">rhs</span> is literally identical in both assignments.  Such 
assignments are not necessarily errors, but are kind of odd.</p>
