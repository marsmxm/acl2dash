<p>Embed some raw lisp code as an event.</p><pre class="code">Example Form:
(<a href="ACL2____IN-RAW-MODE.html">in-raw-mode</a>
  (format t "Preparing to load file...~%")
  (load "my-file.lisp"))

General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____IN-RAW-MODE.html">in-raw-mode</a> form1 form2 ... formk)</pre> 
 
 <p>where each <span class="v">formi</span> is processed as though all the forms are preceded by 
 <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a></span><span class="v"> t</span>.  Thus, the forms need not be <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>; 
 they need not even be legal ACL2 forms.  See <a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a> for a 
 discussion of the so-called ``raw mode'' under which the forms are evaluated 
 â€” unless raw mode is disabled by one of the forms, for example, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a> nil)</span>, in which case evaluation resumes in non-raw mode.</p> 
 
 <p>WARNING: Thus, an <span class="v">in-raw-mode</span> form is potentially very dangerous!  For 
 example, you can use it to call the Common Lisp <span class="v">load</span> function to load 
 arbitrary Common Lisp code, perhaps even overwriting definitions of ACL2 
 system functions!  Thus, as with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RAW-MODE.html">set-raw-mode</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____IN-RAW-MODE.html">in-raw-mode</a></span> may 
 not be evaluated unless there is an active trust tag in effect.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">defttag</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that the normal undoing mechanism (see <a href="ACL2____UBT.html">ubt</a>) is not supported 
 when raw mode is used.</p>
