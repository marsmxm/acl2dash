<p>Fixtypes of objects.</p><p>The concrete syntax of Yul objects is described in 
     [Yul: Specification of Yul Object]. 
     That description refers to the old grammar (see (@see concrete-syntax)); 
     the new grammar does not include Yul objects.</p><p>Here we formalize an abstract syntax version of Yul objects. 
     We ``map'' from the old grammar to the new grammar as needed.</p>
