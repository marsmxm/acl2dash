<p>A static semantics of C for ATC.</p><p>In order to support the generation of proofs for 
     the C code generated by ATC, 
     we need a static semantics (as well as a dynamic semantics) 
     of (the needed portion of) C. 
     The static semantics serves to prove that 
     the generated C code compiles. 
     Here we provide a formal static semantics, 
     which support the generation of proofs for the C code generated by ATC.</p><p>This static semantics may be extended in the future, 
     and may be replaced by a more comprehensive model 
     that we will be developing as part of the <a href="C____LANGUAGE.html">language formalization</a>.</p><p>The static semantics is defined over the C abstract syntax, 
     but for now it rejects some valid constructs 
     just because ATC currently does not generate those constructs. 
     This way, we keep the static semantics simpler. 
     Being more restrictive is adequate here: 
     if a program generated by ATC passes the constraints 
     of this excessively strict static semantics, 
     it is a valid C program, 
     regardless of the fact that valid C programs (not generated by ATC) 
     are rejected by this static semantics.</p><p>This static semantics consists of ACL2 functions 
     that check whether the abstract syntactic entities 
     satisfy the needed constraints. 
     If the constraints are satisfied, 
     additional information (e.g. types) may be returned, 
     used to check constraints on enclosing abstract syntactic entities.</p>
