<p>A <a href="ACL2____SATLINK.html">satlink</a> plugin for saving problems and storing them in 
<span class="v">satlink-benchmarks</span> directories.</p><p>This Satlink plugin can be used to automatically collect up all 
problems given to Satlink into <span class="v">satlink-benchmarks</span> directories.  These 
files might be useful for benchmarking or testing SAT solvers.</p> 
 
<p>To use the plugin, simply include the following book:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "centaur/satlink/benchmarks" :dir :system)</pre> 
 
<p>and invoke Satlink as normal.  For instance, if you have a collection of 
<a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">ACL2::books</a> that use <a href="ACL2____GL.html">gl</a> in Satlink mode to prove some 
theorems, then adding the above <span class="v">include-book</span> should allow you to gather up 
all of the SAT problems that GL solves during the course of certifying your 
books.</p> 
 
<p>This plugin saves SAT problems into the <span class="v">./satlink-benchmarks</span> directory, 
relative to wherever you are running the tests.  That is, if you many different 
directories with their own GL/Satlink-based proofs, you'll get multiple 
<span class="v">satlink-benchmarks</span> directories spread out throughout your file system.</p> 
 
<p>The resulting files are in DIMACS format and have ugly names like:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>xzsVtfY_tkY72RMcmmAkOw.sat</li> 
<li>Y5fvIdHKoF_5ZPLjF75gCg.unsat</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The extension says whether the problem was satisfiable or unsatisfiable. 
The file names are generated using an md5sum of the contents of the file. 
Although they are ugly, this scheme (practically speaking) ensures that:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We don't gather multiple copies of identical problems.  That is, if we 
certify and then re-certify the same books multiple times, the problems that GL 
gives to Satlink will be the same each time, so we'll overwrite the previous 
benchmarks with copies of themselves.</li> 
 
<li>We don't have to coordinate between multiple machines that are solving 
benchmarks in parallel and writing to the same NFS-mounted directory.  That is, 
we never have to ask a question like: what's the next free file name?</li> 
 
<li>We <i>do</i> gather any variants of the same proof over time.  That is, as 
the design evolves, or as the spec changes, or as GL/ESIM/etc. are improved, GL 
may end up giving Satlink different problems when proving the "same" theorem. 
Since the new problems will have new checksums, the old benchmarks won't be 
lost.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>This hook is largely implemented in Perl, so you can customize its behavior 
by editing the <span class="v">books/centaur/satlink/add-benchmark.pl</span> script.</p>
