 <p>This is a very general command that is used to define other sequencing

 <p>Each instruction in the list <span class="v">instruction-list</span> is run, and the 
 instruction ``succeeds'' if every instruction in <span class="v">instruction-list</span> 
 ``succeeds''.  However, it might ``succeed'' even if some instructions in the 
 list ``fail''; more generally, the various arguments control a number of 
 aspects of the running of the instructions.  All this is explained in the 
 paragraphs below.  First we embark on a general discussion of the instruction 
 interpreter, including the notions of ``succeed'' and ``fail''.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Remark:</b> The arguments are <b>not</b> evaluated, except (in a sense) 
 for <span class="v">success-expr</span>, as described below.</p> 
 
 <p>Each primitive and meta instruction can be thought of as returning an <a href="ACL2____ERROR-TRIPLE.html">error-triple</a>, say <span class="v">(erp val state)</span>.  An instruction (primitive or meta) 
 ``succeeds'' if <span class="v">erp</span> is <span class="v">nil</span> and <span class="v">val</span> is not <span class="v">nil</span>; otherwise 
 it ``fails''.  (When we use the words ``succeed'' or ``fail'' in this 
 technical sense, we'll always include them in double quotes.)  If an 
 instruction ``fails,'' we say that the failure is ``soft'' if <span class="v">erp</span> is 
 <span class="v">nil</span>; otherwise the failure is ``hard''.  The <span class="v">sequence</span> command gives 
 the user control over how to treat ``success'' and ``failure'' when sequencing 
 instructions, though we have created a number of handy macro commands for this 
 purpose, notably <span class="v">do-all</span>, <span class="v">do-strict</span> and <span class="v">protect</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is precisely what happens when a <span class="v">sequence</span> instruction is run. 
 The instruction interpreter is run on the instructions supplied in the 
 argument <span class="v">instruction-list</span> (in order).  The interpreter halts the first 
 time there is a hard ``failure.'' except that if <span class="v">strict-flg</span> is supplied 
 and not <span class="v">nil</span>, then the interpreter halts the first time there is any 
 ``failure.''  The error triple <span class="v">(erp val state)</span> returned by the 
 <span class="v">sequence</span> instruction is the triple returned by the last instruction 
 executed (or, the triple <span class="v">(nil t state)</span> if <span class="v">instruction-list</span> is 
 <span class="v">nil</span>), except for the following provision.  If <span class="v">success-expr</span> is 
 supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>, then it is evaluated with the state global 
 variables <span class="v">pc-erp</span> and <span class="v">pc-val</span> (in the "ACL2" package) bound to the 
 corresponding components of the error triple returned (as described above). 
 At least two values should be returned, and the first two of these will be 
 substituted for <span class="v">erp</span> and <span class="v">val</span> in the triple finally returned by 
 <span class="v">sequence</span>.  For example, if <span class="v">success-expr</span> is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> erp val)</span>, then 
 no change will be made to the error triple, and if instead it is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> nil
 t)</span>, then the <span class="v">sequence</span> instruction will ``succeed''.</p> 
 
 <p>That concludes the description of the error triple returned by a 
 <span class="v">sequence</span> instruction, but it remains to explain the effects of the 
 arguments <span class="v">protect-flg</span> and <span class="v">no-prompt-flg</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>If <span class="v">protect-flg</span> is supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span> and if also the 
 instruction ``fails'' (i.e., the error component of the triple is not <span class="v">nil</span> 
 or the value component is <span class="v">nil</span>), then the state is reverted so that the 
 interactive proof-builder's state (including the behavior of <span class="v">restore</span>) is 
 set back to what it was before the <span class="v">sequence</span> instruction was executed. 
 Otherwise, unless <span class="v">no-restore-flg</span> is set, the state is changed so that the 
 <span class="v">restore</span> command will now undo the effect of this <span class="v">sequence</span> 
 instruction (even if there were nested calls to <span class="v">sequence</span>).</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, as each instruction in <span class="v">instruction-list</span> is executed, the 
 prompt and that instruction will be printed, unless the global state variable 
 <span class="v">pc-print-prompt-and-instr-flg</span> is unbound or <span class="v">nil</span> and the parameter 
 <span class="v">no-prompt-flg</span> is supplied and not <span class="v">nil</span>.</p>
