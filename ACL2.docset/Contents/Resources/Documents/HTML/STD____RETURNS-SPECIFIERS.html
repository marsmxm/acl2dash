<p>A concise way to name, document, and prove basic type-like theorems 
about a function's return values.</p><p>The <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a> macro and some other <a href="ACL2____STD_F2UTIL.html">std/util</a> macros 
support a <span class="v">:returns</span> option.  This option provides a concise way to name, 
document, and prove basic type-like theorems about the return values of your 
functions.  Named return values also allow your function to be used with the 
special <a href="ACL2____PATBIND-RET.html">ret</a> binder for <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a>.</p> 
 
<p>The general form is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">   :returns return-spec       ;; for single-value functions
or :returns (<a href="ACL2____MV.html">mv</a> return-spec*) ;; for multiple-valued functions</pre> 
 
<p>There should be exactly one <span class="v">return-spec</span> per return value.  Each 
return-spec has the form:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">   name               ;; just for naming return values
or (name [option]*)   ;; for naming, documenting, and proving theorems</pre> 
 
<p>where <span class="v">name</span> is a symbol and the options can come in any order.  To 
distinguish between the two forms of <span class="v">:returns</span>, it is not legal to use 
<span class="v">mv</span> as the name of a return value.  The options are:</p> 
 
<dl> 
 
<dt>
<span class="v">&lt;xdoc&gt;</span>, any string literal</dt> 
 
<dd>You can document each return value with a string literal.  The string may 
make use of <a href="XDOC____MARKUP.html">xdoc::markup</a> and <a href="XDOC____PREPROCESSOR.html">xdoc::preprocessor</a> directives. 
Typically these descriptions should be short and not include 
document-structuring tags like <span class="v">&lt;p&gt;</span>, <span class="v">&lt;ul&gt;</span>, <span class="v">&lt;h3&gt;</span>, and so forth. 
See the section on xdoc integration, below, for more details.</dd> 
 
<dt>
<span class="v">&lt;return-type&gt;</span>, a symbol or term</dt> 
 
<dd>When provided, the return type is used to generate a basic type-like 
theorems about the return values.  A default hint is provided if no <span class="v">:hints</span> 
keyword is present; see the discussion of <span class="v">:hints</span> below.</dd> 
 
<dd>
<b>Important Note</b> in the multiple-valued case, this approach assumes 
you are using the <span class="v">tools/mv-nth</span> book.  The theorems we prove target terms 
like <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 0 (f ...))</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 1 (f ...))</span>.  This will not work 
well if <a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> is enabled, especially about the 0th return value. For 
your convenience, <span class="v">define</span> automatically includes the <span class="v">tools/mv-nth</span> 
book.  You really should be using it, you know.</dd> 
 
<dd>As a convenient shorthand, you can use a single symbol like <span class="v">evenp</span>. 
The theorem to be proven in this case might be, e.g., <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EVENP.html">evenp</a> (f x))</span> for a 
single-valued function, or <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EVENP.html">evenp</a> (<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 3 (f x)))</span> if this is the 
fourth (because of zero-indexing) return value of a multiply-valued function. 
The symbol <span class="v">t</span> is explicitly allowed and results in no theorem.  The symbol 
<span class="v">nil</span> and keyword symbols are explicitly invalid as return types.</dd> 
 
<dd>In certain cases, you may wish to prove a more complex theorem, e.g., say 
we want to prove this return value is always greater than 5.  To support this, 
you can write a return type like <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP_____C3.html">&lt;</a> 5 ans)</span>, where <span class="v">ans</span> is the 
<span class="v">name</span> of this return value.  You can also refer to the names of other 
return values in this term.  To make it easy to distinguish return types from 
other options, the return type term must be a cons and must not begin with 
<span class="v">quote</span>.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">:hyp hyp-term</span></dt> 
 
<dd>This option only makes sense when there is a return-type term.  By default, 
the return-type theorem is unconditional.  If the theorem needs a hypothesis, 
you can put it here.</dd> 
 
<dd>Frequently, the hypothesis you want for a type-like theorem is for the 
guards of the function to be met.  As a convenient shorthand, <span class="v">hyp-term</span> may 
be: 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">:guard</span> -- use the function's guard as the hypothesis</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">:fguard</span> -- like <span class="v">:guard</span>, but <a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a> the entire guard</li> 
</ul> 
 
If neither of these is what you want, you can provide an arbitrary 
<span class="v">hyp-term</span>.  Typically this term should mention only the formals of your 
function.  The return values of the theorem will not be bound in scope of the 
hyp, so trying to refer to them in a hypothesis is generally an error.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">:hints hints-term</span></dt> 
 
<dd>This option only makes sense when there is a return-type term; when 
specified, the given hints are passed to the proof attempt for the associated 
return-type.  When no <span class="v">:hints</span> keyword is present, a default hint is taken 
from the <span class="v">std::returnspec</span> entry of the <span class="v">std::default-hints-table</span> table, 
but this is overridden if the <span class="v">:hints</span> keyword is present, even for 
<span class="v">:hints nil</span>.  To change the default hints, you may use 
<span class="v">set-returnspec-default-hints</span>.  The setting for this provided in the 
std/util books provides an induction and expand hint when the 
function introduced is singly-recursive.</dd> 
 
<dd>A few special symbols (and even substrings of symbols) are substituted into 
hints; see the section "Substitutions" below.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">:rule-classes classes</span></dt> 
 
<dd>This option only makes sense when there is a return-type term.  By default, 
the return-type theorem is added as a <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule.  If you want to use 
other <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">ACL2::rule-classes</a>, then you will want to override this default.</dd> 
 
<dd>A few special symbols (and even substrings of symbols) are substituted into 
hints; see the section "Substitutions" below.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">:name name</span></dt> 
 
<dd>This allows you to control the name of the associated theorem.</dd> 
 
<dd>The default value of <span class="v">name</span> is type-of-your-function. 
For example, <span class="v">natp-of-foo</span>.</dd> 
 
<dt><span class="v">:hints-sub-returnnames</span></dt> 
 
<dd>This option determines whether the 
return-name substitution is applied to the hints. See "Substitutions" 
below.</dd> 
 
</dl> 
 
<h3>Substitutions</h3> 
 
<p>Certain symbols and certain substrings of symbols are 
replaced in the theorem body, hints, and rule-classes.</p> 
 
<p>The following substitutions replace any symbol matching the given name in 
all three places (body, hints, and rule-classes):</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>
<span class="v">&lt;CALL&gt;</span> is replaced by the function applied to the formals.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&lt;FN&gt;</span> is replaced by the function's macro alias, if it has one, or else its name.  That is, for a form that introduces <span class="v">foo</span> with macro arguments, creating a function named <span class="v">foo-fn</span>, this produces <span class="v">foo</span>.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&lt;FN!&gt;</span> is replaced by the functions name, strictly, i.e. <span class="v">foo-fn</span> in the example above.</li> 
<li>
<span class="v">&lt;VALUES&gt;</span> is replaced by the list of return value names.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>In the hints, the substrings <span class="v">&lt;FN&gt;</span> and <span class="v">&lt;FN!&gt;</span> of symbol names are 
also substituted as above.  This allows hints to refer to <a href="ACL2____DEFRET.html">defret</a>-style 
theorem names.</p> 
 
<p>In the rule-classes, the return value names are substituted for appropriate 
terms; i.e., if the second return value of <span class="v">foo</span> is named <span class="v">bar</span>, then 
<span class="v">bar</span> becomes <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____MV-NTH.html">mv-nth</a> 1 (foo ...))</span>.  This substitution may also 
optionally be applied to the hints by setting the <span class="v">:hints-sub-returnnames</span> option. 
This return name substitution is not applied to the theorem body, but the let-binding 
of the return names to the function call has a similar effect.</p> 
 
<h3>Configuration Object</h3> 
 
<p>Similar to <a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a>, a configuration object can be set up to set some 
options globally (local to a book).  At the moment only the 
<span class="v">:hints-sub-returnnames</span> option is read from this configuration object.  The 
following form sets that option:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(make-returnspec-config :hints-sub-returnnames t)</pre>
