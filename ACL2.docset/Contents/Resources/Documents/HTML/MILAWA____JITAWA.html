<p>Jitawa is a Lisp runtime developed by Magnus Myreen that is capable 
of running the Milawa kernel and checking through the entire bootstrapping 
process, and which is verified down to the machine code with HOL4.</p><p>Magnus Myreen has used the HOL4 system to prove an unbelievably 
impressive theorem: if you run the simplified Milawa kernel on his Jitawa Lisp 
runtime on an 64-bit X86 system, it can only accept theorems of formulas that 
are semantically true.  This theorem connects the logical semantics, down 
through the kernel's source code, through the Jitawa Lisp implementation, down 
to a formal HOL model of the x86 machine code!</p>
