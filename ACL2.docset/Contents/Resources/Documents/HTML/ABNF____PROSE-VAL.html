</dl><p>In the abstract syntax, 
    we use character strings 
    for the bracketed prose described by the rule <span class="v">prose-val</span> in [RFC:4]. 
    We abstract away the restriction 
    that the prose include only certain characters 
    (which all are ACL2 characters). 
    This restriction is captured by the notion of <a href="ABNF____PROSE-VAL-WFP.html">well-formed prose value notations</a>.</p>
