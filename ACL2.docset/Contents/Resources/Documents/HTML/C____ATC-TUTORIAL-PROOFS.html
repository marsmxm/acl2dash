<p>ATC tutorial: ACL2 Proofs Generated for the Generated C code.</p><p>(This page may be skipped at first reading.)</p><p>Besides generating C code, 
    ATC also generates ACL2 proofs of 
    the correctness of the generated C code 
    with respect to the ACL2 code from which the C code is generated. 
    More precisely, ATC generates ACL2 theorems 
    that assert these correctness properties.</p><p>The correctness properties proved by ATC are the following:</p><ul>
<li>The generated C code satisfies 
     the compile-time constraints prescribed by [C]. 
     In other words, the C code is compilable by compliant compilers. 
     This is expressed via a <a href="C____STATIC-SEMANTICS.html">formal static semantics of C</a>.</li>
<li>The generated C code is functionally equivalent 
     to the ACL2 code that represents it. 
     In other words, it computes the same things as the ACL2 code. 
     This is expressed via a <a href="C____ATC-DYNAMIC-SEMANTICS.html">formal dynamic semantics of C</a>.</li>
