</dl><p><b>WARNING</b>.  We have not paid much attention to strengths, and 
our transformations probably do not handle them properly.</p> 
 
<p>See sections 7.1.2 and 7.9 of the Verilog-2005 standard for discussion of 
strength modelling.  Every regular gate has, associated with it, two drive 
strengths; a "strength0" which says how strong its output is when it is a 
logical zero, and "strength1" which says how strong the output is when it is 
a logical one.  Strengths also seem to be used on assignments and module 
instances.</p> 
 
<p>There seem to be some various rules for default strengths in 7.1.2, and also 
in 7.13.  But our parser does not try to implement these defaults, and we only 
associate strengths onto module items where they are explicitly 
specified.</p>
