<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS">Click for Set-inhibit-warnings in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Control warnings</p><pre class="code">Examples:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a> "theory" "use")</pre> 
 
 <p>Note: This is an event!  It does not print the usual event <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a> 
 but nevertheless changes the ACL2 logical <a href="ACL2____WORLD.html">world</a> and is so recorded.  It 
 is <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> to the book or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form in which it occurs; 
 see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS_12.html">set-inhibit-warnings!</a> for a corresponding non-<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> event. 
 Indeed, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a> ...)</span> is equivalent to <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a>
 (<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS_12.html">set-inhibit-warnings!</a> ...))</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-WARNINGS.html">set-inhibit-warnings</a> string1 string2 ...)</pre> 
 
 <p>where each string is considered without regard to case.  This macro is is 
 essentially <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> inhibit-warnings-table nil 'alist :clear))</span>, 
 where <span class="v">alist</span> pairs each supplied string with <span class="v">nil</span>: that is, <span class="v">alist</span> 
 is <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PAIRLIS_42.html">pairlis$</a> lst nil)</span> where <span class="v">lst</span> is the list of strings supplied. 
 This macro is an event (see <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a>), but no output results from a 
 <span class="v">set-inhibit-warnings</span> event.</p> 
 
 <p>ACL2 prints warnings that may, from time to time, seem excessive to 
 experienced users.  Each warning is ``labeled'' with a string identifying the 
 type of warning.  Consider for example</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 Warning [Use] in ( THM ...):  It is unusual to :USE ....</pre> 
 
 <p>Here, the label is "Use".  The argument list for 
 <span class="v">set-inhibit-warnings</span> is a list of such labels, each of which is a string. 
 Any warning is suppressed if its label is a member of this list, where case is 
 ignored.  Thus, for example, the warning above will not be printed after a 
 call of <span class="v">set-inhibit-warnings</span> that contains the string, <span class="v">"Use"</span> (or 
 any string that is <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____STRING-EQUAL.html">string-equal</a></span> to <span class="v">"Use"</span>, such as <span class="v">"use"</span> 
 or <span class="v">"USE"</span>).  In summary: the effect of this event is to suppress any 
 warning whose label is a member of the given argument list, where case is 
 ignored.</p> 
 
 <p>The list of currently inhibited warnings is the list of keys in the <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a> named <span class="v">inhibit-warnings-table</span>.  (The values in the table are 
 irrelevant.)  One way to get that value is to get the result from evaluating 
 the following form: <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TABLE-ALIST.html">table-alist</a> 'inhibit-warnings-table (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</span>.  Of 
 course, if warnings are inhibited overall — see <a href="ACL2____SET-INHIBIT-OUTPUT-LST.html">set-inhibit-output-lst</a> — then this value is entirely irrelevant.</p> 
 
 <p>See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TOGGLE-INHIBIT-WARNING.html">toggle-inhibit-warning</a></span> for a way to add or remove a single 
 warning string.</p>
