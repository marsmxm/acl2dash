<p>Subtheories of the ACL2 initialization theory.</p><div class="box"><p>Note: Jared recommends against following the advice below.  In 
particular, using <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IN-THEORY.html">in-theory</a> nil)</span> is probably not a good idea most of the 
time.</p></div> 
 
<p>The conventional way to initiate the definition of a book in the IHS library 
hierarchy is to</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>Include all necessary books</li> 
<li>DISABLE the world with (IN-THEORY NIL), and</li> 
<li>Construct the theory needed to certify 
  the present book from theory expressions supplied by the included books.</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>The <span class="v">ihs-theories</span> book includes the most basic theories, i.e., theories 
of the ACL2 functions available at this label: 'IHS-THEORIES, which is exactly 
the extension of the ACL2 initialization theory made by "ihs-init".  Every 
IHS book will normally begin by ENABLEing one of these theories.  Some of the 
theories may also be useful, for example, to specify very restricted local 
theories for specialized apllications.</p>
