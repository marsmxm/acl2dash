<p>Deeply embedded semantics of PFCS.</p><p>The semantics informally described in <a href="PFCS____SEMANTICS.html">semantics</a> 
     can be formalized, mathematically, as a function 
     with the following characteristics. 
     The function takes the following inputs:</p><ol>
<li>A system of constraints, of type <span class="tt"><a href="PFCS____SYSTEM.html">system</a></span>.</li>
<li>A constraint, of type <span class="tt"><a href="PFCS____CONSTRAINT.html">constraint</a></span>.</li>
<li>An assignment, 
      i.e. a finite map from variables to prime field elements</li>
</ol><p>The function returns one of the following possible outputs:</p><ul>
<li>The boolean `true', indicating that, 
      given the input system of constraints, 
      the input constraint is satisfied by the input assignment.</li>
<li>The boolean `false', indicating that, 
      given the input system of constraints, 
      the input constraint is not satisfied by the input assignment.</li>
<li>An error indication, indicating that, 
      given the input system of constraints, 
      the input constraint cannot be evaluated as satisfied or not.</li>
</ul><p>The third output happens when, for instance, 
     the constraint references 
     a variable that is not in the assignment, 
     or a relation that is not in the system. 
     This should never happen when the system and constraint are <a href="PFCS____WELL-FORMEDNESS.html">well-formed</a>, which we plan to prove formally.</p><p>Attempting to define this function in ACL2 runs into an issue. 
     A constraint that is a call of a relation is satisfied 
     when all the constraints that form the body of the relation are, 
     in some assigment that extends the one that assigns 
     the actual parameters to the formal parameters. 
     This is an existential quantification, 
     which is expressed via <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span> in ACL2, 
     but the semantics function is recursive, 
     and a mutual recursion cannot involve a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-SK.html">defun-sk</a></span>.</p><p>To overcome this issue, 
     we formalize a logical proof system 
     to derive assertions about the semantic function sketched above, 
     and we define the semantic function in terms of the proof system.</p>
