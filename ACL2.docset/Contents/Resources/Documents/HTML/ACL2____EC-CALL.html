<p>Execute a call in the ACL2 logic instead of raw Lisp</p><p>The name ``<span class="v">ec-call</span>'' represents ``executable-counterpart 
 call.''  This utility is intended for users who are familiar with guards.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> for a general discussion of guards.</p> 
 
 <p>Logically, <span class="v">ec-call</span> behaves like the identity macro; during proofs, 
 <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> TERM)</span> is typically replaced quickly by <span class="v">TERM</span> during a proof 
 attempt.  However, <span class="v">ec-call</span> causes function calls to be evaluated in the 
 ACL2 logic rather than raw Lisp, as explained below.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">General Form:
(<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (fn term1 ... termk))</pre> 
 
 <p>where <span class="v">fn</span> is a known function symbol other than those in the list that 
 is the value of the constant <span class="v">*ec-call-bad-ops*</span>.  (But see the Final Note 
 below for an exception pertaining to inlining.)  In particular, <span class="v">fn</span> is not 
 a macro.  Semantically, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (fn term1 ... termk))</span> equals <span class="v">(fn
 term1 ... termk)</span>.  However, this use of <span class="v">ec-call</span> has two effects.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>(1) <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">Guard</a> verification generates no proof obligations from the guard 
 of <span class="v">fn</span> for this call.  Indeed, guards need not have been verified for 
 <span class="v">fn</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>(2) During evaluation, after the arguments of <span class="v">fn</span> are evaluated as 
 usual, the executable-counterpart of <span class="v">fn</span> is called, rather than its 
 submitted version (see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a>).  That is, the call of <span class="v">fn</span> is 
 made on its evaluated arguments as though this call is being made in the ACL2 
 top-level loop, rather than in raw Lisp.  In particular, the <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a> of 
 <span class="v">fn</span> is checked, at least by default (see <a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a>).</p>
</blockquote> 
 
 <p>The use of <span class="v">ec-call</span> does not turn off guard-checking, but that can be 
 accomplished by using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WITH-GUARD-CHECKING.html">with-guard-checking</a></span> as well.  Consider the 
 following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f1 (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))
  (<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> t x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>This definition is admitted, but evaluation of <span class="v">(f1 '(a b c))</span> 
 nevertheless causes a guard violation (at least, by default).  However, if 
 instead we submit the following definition, then there is no guard violation 
 for that call of <span class="v">f1</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f1 (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))
  (<a href="ACL2____WITH-GUARD-CHECKING.html">with-guard-checking</a> nil (<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> t x))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Note that in the term <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (fn term1 ... termk))</span>, only the 
 indicated call of <span class="v">fn</span> is made in the logic; each <span class="v">termi</span> is evaluated 
 in the normal manner.  If you want an entire term evaluated in the logic, wrap 
 <span class="v">ec-call</span> around each function call in the term (other than calls of 
 <span class="v">if</span> and <span class="v">ec-call</span>).</p> 
 
 <p><b>Technical Remark</b> (probably best ignored).  During evaluation of a 
 call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCONST.html">defconst</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFPKG.html">defpkg</a></span> in raw Lisp, a form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (fn
 term1 ... termk))</span> is treated as <span class="v">(fn term1 ... termk)</span>, that is, without 
 calling the executable-counterpart of <span class="v">fn</span>.  This situation occurs when 
 loading a compiled file (or expansion file) on behalf of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> event.  The reason is technical: executable-counterparts are 
 defined below a book's events in the book's compiled file.  End of Technical 
 Remark.</p> 
 
 <p>Here is another small example.  We define <span class="v">foo</span> recursively but with 
 guard verification inhibited on the recursive call, which is to be evaluated 
 in the ACL2 logic.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x y)
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> y)))
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
            (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x) (<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> y))))
          (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> y)))

The admission of FOO is trivial, using the relation O&lt; (which is known
to be well-founded on the domain recognized by O-P) and the measure
(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-COUNT</a> X).  We could deduce no constraints on the type of FOO.

Computing the guard conjecture for FOO....

The guard conjecture for FOO is trivial to prove.  FOO is compliant
with Common Lisp.

ACL2 Error in TOP-LEVEL:  The guard for the function call (FOO X Y),
which is (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> Y), is violated by the arguments in the call
(FOO '(4 5) NIL).  To debug see :DOC print-gv, see :DOC trace, and
see :DOC wet.  See :DOC set-guard-checking for information about suppressing
this check with (<a href="ACL2____SET-GUARD-CHECKING.html">set-guard-checking</a> :none), as recommended for new
users.

ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>The error above arises because eventually, <span class="v">foo</span> recurs down to a value 
 of parameter <span class="v">y</span> that violates the guard.  This is clear from tracing (see 
 <a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a> and see <a href="COMMON-LISP____TRACE.html">trace</a>).  Each call of the executable-counterpart 
 of <span class="v">foo</span> checks the guard and then invokes the submitted version of 
 <span class="v">foo</span> (see <a href="ACL2____EVALUATION.html">evaluation</a>).  The submitted version calls the 
 executable-counterpart on the recursive call.  When the guard check fails we 
 get a violation.</p>

 <p>Final note: although in general, the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (fn term1
 ... termk))</span> is only legal if <span class="v">fn</span> is a function symbol, such a form is 
 also legal if <span class="v">fn</span> is introduced with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFUN-INLINE.html">defun-inline</a></span>, or with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFINE.html">define</a></span> using keyword argument <span class="v">:inline t</span>.  In those cases, <span class="v">fn</span> is a 
 macro whose calls expand to corresponding calls of <span class="v">fn$INLINE</span>, the symbol 
 in the same package as <span class="v">fn</span> but with the string <span class="v">"$INLINE"</span> added as a 
 suffix to the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOL-NAME.html">symbol-name</a></span> of <span class="v">fn</span>.  We do not however extend this 
 exception to macros in general, even when <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-FN.html">add-macro-fn</a></span> has been 
 invoked.  Consider the following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
 ()
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo () nil)
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> bar () t)
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> mac () nil)
 (<a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a> mac foo)
 (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____ADD-MACRO-ALIAS.html">add-macro-alias</a> mac bar))
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> h () (<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (mac)))
 (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bad (h)))</pre> 
 
 <p>Consider what would happen if this were legal, where <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____EC-CALL.html">ec-call</a> (mac))</span> 
 used the macro-alias, <span class="v">foo</span>, for <span class="v">mac</span>.  Then in the first pass of the 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> form above, the final <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event would prove, 
 since (ec-call (mac)) is treated as (ec-call (bar)).  But on the second pass, 
 ACL2 would store <span class="v">bad</span> as a theorem even though <span class="v">(h)</span> would evaluate to 
 <span class="v">nil</span>, since the macro-alias of <span class="v">mac</span> is <span class="v">foo</span> on the second 
 pass.</p>
