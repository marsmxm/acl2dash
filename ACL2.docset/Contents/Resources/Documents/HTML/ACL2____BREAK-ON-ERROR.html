<p>Break when encountering a hard or soft error caused by ACL2</p><pre class="code">General forms:
(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a> t)    ; installs a trace causing a continuable error (break)
                      ;   when an error is invoked by ACL2.
(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a>)      ; same as above
(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a> :all) ; same as above, but even when inside the prover
(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a> nil)  ; uninstall any above trace</pre> 
 
 <p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">Break-on-error</a>)</span> generates a suitable trace of error functions. 
 Evaluate <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a>)</span> after <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____BREAK-ON-ERROR.html">break-on-error</a>)</span> if you want to see the 
 specific trace forms (which you can modify and then submit directly to 
 <span class="v">trace$</span>, if you wish).  This <a href="COMMON-LISP____TRACE.html">trace</a> should cause entry to the Lisp 
 debugger whenever ACL2 calls its error routines, except for certain errors 
 when inside the theorem prover, and also at those times if option :all is 
 supplied.</p> 
 
 <p>NOTE: For technical reasons, you may see some error messages more than 
 once.</p> 
 
 <p>Finally, note that you are welcome to define your own version of 
 <span class="v">break-on-error</span> by modifying a copy of the source definition (search for 
 ``<span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFMACRO.html">defmacro</a> break-on-error</span>'' in ACL2 source file other-events.lisp). 
 Please feel free to send your version of <span class="v">break-on-error</span> to the ACL2 
 implementors, for possible inclusion into ACL2.</p> 
 
 <p><span class="v">Break-on-error</span> is implemented using ACL2 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a></span>.  See <a href="ACL2____TRACE_12.html">trace!</a> if you want an explanation of the ``<span class="v">TTAG NOTE</span>'' that is 
 printed.</p> 
 
 <p>The argument, if supplied, is evaluated and must evaluate to <span class="v">t</span>, 
 <span class="v">nil</span>, or <span class="v">:all</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Also see <a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a> for how to get raw-Lisp backtrace 
 information when an error occurs as a result of <span class="v">break-on-error</span>, or even 
 of a raw Lisp error, by calling <span class="v">set-debugger-enable</span> with argument 
 <span class="v">:bt</span>, <span class="v">:bt-break</span>, or <span class="v">:break-bt</span>.  Note that for ACL2 errors (as 
 opposed to raw Lisp errors), i.e. errors affected by <span class="v">break-on-error</span>, all 
 three of those keyword values are treated equivalently (and, all are ignored 
 for non-ANSI GCL; see <a href="ACL2____SET-DEBUGGER-ENABLE.html">set-debugger-enable</a>).</p>
