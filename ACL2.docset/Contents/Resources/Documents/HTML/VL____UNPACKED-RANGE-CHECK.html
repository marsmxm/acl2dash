<p>Warn about partselects on unpacked arrays.</p><p>Some tools don't deal well with idioms like the following:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">logic [width-1:0] to [height];
logic [width-1:0] from [height+4];

assign to = from[2+=height];</pre> 
 
<p>That is, they don't handle partselects across unpacked arrays. This warns 
about expressions that contain such constructs.</p>
