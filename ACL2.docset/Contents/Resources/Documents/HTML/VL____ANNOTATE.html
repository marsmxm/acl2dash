to normalize the design and check it for well-formedness.</p><p>The <a href="VL____VL-DESIGN.html">vl-design</a>s produced by VL's <a href="VL____LOADER.html">loader</a> are not yet in 
a very finished or error-checked form.  The function <a href="VL____VL-ANNOTATE-DESIGN.html">vl-annotate-design</a> 
transforms such a ``raw'' design into something that is much more reasonable to 
work with.  Typically it should be invoked immediately after loading as the 
first step in any VL-based tool.</p>
