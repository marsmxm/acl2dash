<p>Information about the multiple-include status of an individual file.</p><p>This is a product type introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">defprod</a>.</p> 
<h5>Fields</h5> 
<dl>
<dt>controller — <span class="tt">maybe-string</span>
</dt> 
<dd>NIL if this file does not have a proper include guard, 
                or the name of the controlling define otherwise.</dd> 
 
<dt>misses — <a href="VL____VL-LOCATIONLIST.html">vl-locationlist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>For evaluating multiple-include optimization effectiveness.  This 
            is a list of places where this file is <span class="v">`include</span>d and is 
            actually being loaded from disk.  For files that follow proper 
            include-guard discipline, this should end up being a singleton list 
            with only the initial <span class="v">`include</span> of the file.  For files that 
            don't follow the include-guard discipline but are included multiple 
            times, it may be a longer list.</dd> 
 
<dt>hits — <a href="VL____VL-LOCATIONLIST.html">vl-locationlist</a>
</dt> 
<dd>For evaluating multiple-include optimization effectiveness.  This is 
          a list of places where this file is being <span class="v">`include</span>d from but 
          where we don't bother reloading it thanks to MI optimization.</dd> 
 
<dt>len — <a href="ACL2____NATP.html">natp</a>
</dt> 
<dd>Length of this file in characters.  Possibly of interest for 
         evaluating multiple-include effectiveness.</dd>
