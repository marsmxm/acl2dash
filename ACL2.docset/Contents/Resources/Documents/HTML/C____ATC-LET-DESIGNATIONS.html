<p>Designations of <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> representations 
          for ATC.</p><p>ACL2's <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> is used to represent four different things in C:</p><ul>
<li>A local variable declaration with an initializer.</li>
<li>An assignment of an expression to a local variable.</li>
<li>An assignment to an element of an array variable.</li>
<li>A transformation of a (local or array) variable via statements.</li>
</ul><p>The case of an array element assignment 
     is recognized by the presence of the array write functions, 
     according to the pattern described in the user documentation. 
     The other three cases could be recognized 
     by looking at the conditions that must hold in each cases, 
     but in order to ease ATC's task, 
     and also to encourage the user to explicate their intentions, 
     we use <span class="tt"><a href="C____DECLAR.html">declar</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="C____ASSIGN.html">assign</a></span> 
     to indicate the declaration and assignment cases, 
     as explained in the user documentation. 
     Thus, the fourth case is what remains when the other three do not apply.</p><p>In all four cases above, 
     the term to which the variable is bound must be single-valued. 
     For multi-valued terms, we follow a similar approach for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span>, 
     which is used to represent three different things in C:</p><ul>
<li>A local variable declaration with an initializer 
      that side-effects some array(s) 
      in addition to returning the value to initialize the variable with.</li>
<li>An assignment of an expression to a local variable 
      where the expression side-effects some array(s) 
      in addition to returning the value to assign to the variable.</li>
<li>A transformation of two or more (local or array) variables 
      via statements.</li>
</ul><p>These cases mirror three of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> cases described above, 
     with the exclusion of array writes, which are only for <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>, 
     due to the restrictions on the ACL2 terms accepted by ATC.</p><p>For these <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> cases, 
     we use a similiar approach to the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> cases, 
     i.e. we explicitly use indicators for declarations and assignments. 
     But the functions <span class="tt"><a href="C____DECLAR.html">declar</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="C____ASSIGN.html">assign</a></span> 
     cannot be applied to multi-valued terms. 
     Thus, we introduce macros <span class="v">declar&lt;n&gt;</span> and <span class="v">assign&lt;n&gt;</span>, 
     for <span class="v">&lt;n&gt;</span> equal to 2, 3, etc. 
     (we stop at some point, but it is easy to add more if needed). 
     These must be macros, and cannot be functions, 
     because function may be only applied to single-valued terms, 
     while macros do not have that restriction; 
     and we need to have different macros for different values of <span class="v">&lt;n&gt;</span>. 
     These representations are described in the user documentation.</p><p>Since ATC works on translated terms, 
     it does not directly see the macros <span class="v">declar&lt;n&gt;</span> and <span class="v">assign&lt;n&gt;</span>. 
     But it recognizes their presence as the term patterns they expand to. 
     See the ATC developer documentation for details.</p><p>We remark that an external (APT) transformation 
     could automatically add the needed wrappers 
     based on the conditions under which a <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MV-LET.html">mv-let</a></span> occurs. 
     Thus, our approach does not forgo automation, 
     but rather modularizes the problem into simpler pieces.</p>
