<p>Undefined function used by <span class="v">badge</span> on non-primitives</p><p>When <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> is given a non-primitive function symbol <span class="v">fn</span> 
   it calls this function to determine the badge of <span class="v">fn</span>.  But this function 
   is undefined.  In the proof theory, its value on a given function symbol 
   <span class="v">fn</span> is specified, if at all, by the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a></span> for <span class="v">fn</span> which 
   must be available as a hypothesis in the formula being proved.  In the 
   evaluation theory, <span class="v">badge-userfn</span> has an attachment that makes it behave 
   as though all warrants are assumed.  See <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BADGE.html">badge</a></span> for details.</p>
