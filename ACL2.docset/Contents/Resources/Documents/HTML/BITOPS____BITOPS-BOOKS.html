<p>Guide to the books in the Bitops library.</p><p>Here is a summary of some of the books in the library.</p> 
 
<h3>Major Lemma Books</h3> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2IHSEXT-BASICS.html">bitops/ihsext-basics</a></h5> 
 
<p>This is a key book in the library and is generally a good starting point. 
It is intended to be a (still lightweight) replacement for books such as 
<span class="v">ihs/logops-lemmas.lisp</span>.</p> 
 
<p>For instance, it has rules such as <span class="v">logand**</span>, which is a recursive 
definition of <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGAND.html">logand</a> that is well-suited for doing inductive proofs, 
etc.  This rule is much like IHS's <span class="v">logand*</span> but is improved since there 
are no hypotheses.</p> 
 
<p>A lot of the rules in <span class="v">ihsext-basics</span> are improved versions of <span class="v">ihs</span> 
rules, but some others are not included at all in <span class="v">ihs</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2IHS-EXTENSIONS.html">bitops/ihs-extensions</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book is sort of a continuation of <span class="v">ihsext-basics</span>.  Oftentimes you 
will not need it.  It adds some bounding theorems that relate various bit-vector 
operations to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n)</span> and may be useful when combining the Bitops 
library with books like <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span> and <span class="v">arithmetic-5</span>.  The rules here 
tend to be more expensive than those in <span class="v">ihsext-basics</span>, so this may not be 
well-suited for machine-code models.</p> 
 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2INTEGER-LENGTH.html">bitops/integer-length</a></h5> 
 
<p>This is included in <span class="v">ihs-extensions.lisp</span>.  It has some basic lemmas 
about <a href="COMMON-LISP____INTEGER-LENGTH.html">integer-length</a> and its relationship to <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a> 2 n)</span>.  It may be 
useful when combining Bitops with libraries such as <span class="v">arithmetic-3</span> and 
<span class="v">arithmetic-5</span>.</p> 
 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2SIGNED-BYTE-P.html">bitops/signed-byte-p</a></h5> 
 
<p>This is a nice, light-weight book that adds a number of "obvious" lemmas 
about <span class="v">signed-byte-p</span> and <span class="v">unsigned-byte-p</span>, e.g., that when you add two 
<span class="v">n</span>-bit signed numbers, you get an <span class="v">n+1</span>-bit signed number.</p> 
 
<p>These rules can be very helpful when you are trying to write optimized 
functions using Common Lisp <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SPEC.html">ACL2::type-spec</a>s and need to satisfy the 
guard obligations that come from terms such as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____THE.html">the</a> (unsigned-byte 16)
x)</span>.</p> 
 
<p>You can use this book independently of the rest of the library.  It 
currently has some support for reasoning about +, -, *, lognot, ash, logcdr, 
loghead, and logtail, and will likely be extended as we find it lacking.  You 
may often wish to at least also load <span class="v">ihsext-basics</span>, since that has bounds 
for many bit-vector operations.</p> 
 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2EQUAL-BY-LOGBITP.html">bitops/equal-by-logbitp</a></h5> 
 
<p>This is a very cool book that allows you to carry out pick-a-point proofs: 
to show that integers <span class="v">x</span> and <span class="v">y</span> are the same, you can show that their 
<span class="v">n</span>th bit is always the same.  This can be a very effective strategy for 
working with sequences of bit-manipulation operations, e.g., updates to a flags 
register on a processor model.  Some computed hints like 
<span class="v">equal-by-logbitp-hammer</span> are also provided, which can automate this 
strategy.</p> 
 
 
 
<h3>Other Lemma Books</h3> 
 
<h5>congruences.lisp</h5> 
 
<p>This is an advanced book that implements an <i>n</i>-ary like mechanism for 
rewriting terms in an <span class="v">n</span>-bit context.</p> 
 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2ASH-BOUNDS.html">bitops/ash-bounds</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book adds some basic bounding and monotonicity lemmas for <a href="COMMON-LISP____ASH.html">ash</a> 
and <a href="ACL2____LOGTAIL.html">logtail</a>.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2LOGBITP-BOUNDS.html">bitops/logbitp-bounds</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book adds some basic lemmas about <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> and <a href="COMMON-LISP____EXPT.html">expt</a>.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2DEFAULTS.html">bitops/defaults</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book just has basic theorems about the "default" behavior of 
bit-vector operations when their inputs are ill-formed (e.g., not integers, not 
naturals).  You probably shouldn't load it; most of this should be subsumed by 
more recent congruence reasoning for <a href="ACL2____NAT-EQUIV.html">nat-equiv</a> and <a href="ACL2____INT-EQUIV.html">int-equiv</a>.</p> 
 
 
<h3>Books with Extra Definitions</h3> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2EXTRA-DEFS.html">bitops/extra-defs</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book is a random assortment of functions for slicing integers, 
manipulating individual bits, and bit scanning.  It will likely be split up and 
organized into separate books in the future.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2MERGE.html">bitops/merge</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book provides several optimized functions for merging together, e.g., 
four bytes into a 32-bit value, or four 16-bit unsigned values into a 64-bit 
result, etc.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2FAST-LOGREV.html">bitops/fast-logrev</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book provides optimized implementations of <a href="ACL2____LOGREV.html">logrev</a> at various 
widths; these definitions are logically just the ordinary, nice, logical 
definition of <span class="v">logrev</span>, thanks to <a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a>.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2PARITY.html">bitops/parity</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book provides a simple recursive definition of a parity (i.e., 
reduction xor) function, and also a faster version for execution.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2PART-SELECT.html">bitops/part-select</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book provides a readable nice macro for extracting a portion of an 
integer, e.g., bits 15-8.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2PART-INSTALL.html">bitops/part-install</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book provides a function and a macro to set a portion of an 
integer to some value. It also includes some theorems about the 
interaction of <span class="v">part-install</span> with <a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2PART-SELECT.html">bitops/part-select</a>.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2ROTATE.html">bitops/rotate</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book defines <a href="ACL2____ROTATE-LEFT.html">rotate-left</a> and <a href="ACL2____ROTATE-RIGHT.html">rotate-right</a> operations.  It 
provides lemmas explaining how <a href="COMMON-LISP____LOGBITP.html">logbitp</a> interacts with these operations, 
and it makes use of the <span class="v">equal-by-logbitp</span> strategy to provide equivalent, 
recursive definitions.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2FAST-ROTATE.html">bitops/fast-rotate</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book defines <a href="BITOPS____FAST-ROTATE.html">fast-rotate</a> operations that are proved equivalent 
to <a href="ACL2____ROTATE-LEFT.html">rotate-left</a> and <a href="ACL2____ROTATE-RIGHT.html">rotate-right</a>.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2SATURATE.html">bitops/saturate</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book defines some optimized signed and unsigned saturation functions.</p> 
 
<h5><a href="BITOPS____BITOPS_F2FAST-LOGEXT.html">bitops/fast-logext</a></h5> 
 
<p>This book provides an optimized sign-extension functions, and proves them 
equivalent to <a href="ACL2____LOGEXT.html">logext</a>.  These optimizations don't impact reasoning 
because we carry them out with <a href="ACL2____MBE.html">mbe</a>.</p>
