 <p>Evaluation of the form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____GET-EVENT-DATA.html">get-event-data</a> key state)</span> returns the value of 
 <span class="v">key</span> in an association list, namely, in the value of <a href="ACL2____STATE.html">state</a> global 
 variable <span class="v">last-event-data</span> (see <a href="ACL2____PROGRAMMING-WITH-STATE.html">programming-with-state</a>).  That alist 
 contains certain information stored at the conclusion of the immediately 
 preceding event, some of which corresponds to the event's <a href="ACL2____SUMMARY.html">summary</a>.  For 
 each key the corresponding value, <span class="v">VAL</span>, is as follows.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">ABORT-CAUSES</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> is a list of reasons why the proof aborted. 
 In particular, if the value <span class="v">INTERRUPT</span> is in the list, then the proof was 
 interrupted (typically with Control-C).</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">FORM</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> is the ``context'' for the event, printed in the 
 summary, <a href="ACL2____WARNINGS.html">warnings</a>, and <a href="ACL2____ERRORS.html">errors</a>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">HINT-EVENTS</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> is as in the corresponding field of the event 
 summary.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">NAMEX</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> is 0, a single name, or a list of names; see 
 comments in ACL2 source function <span class="v">access-event-tuple-namex</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">PROVER-STEPS-COUNTED</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> is as in the corresponding field of 
 the event summary.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">RULES</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> is as in the corresponding field of the event 
 summary.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">SPLITTER-RULES</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> represents the corresponding field of the 
 event summary, as the list <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CASE-SPLIT.html">case-split</a> immed-forced if-intro)</span>.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">SYSTEM-ATTACHMENTS</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> lists the pairs <span class="v">(f . g)</span> for which 
 <span class="v">f</span> is a system function with attachment <span class="v">g</span> (<a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a>), which 
 differs from the attachment to <span class="v">f</span> when ACL2 starts up.</li> 
 
 <li>
<span class="v">TIME</span>: <span class="v">VAL</span> represents the corresponding field of the event 
 summary, as the list <span class="v">(prove print proof-tree other)</span>.</li>
