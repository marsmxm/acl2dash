<p>Representation of a single extended character.</p><p>Historically, a <span class="v">vl-echar-p</span> was an ordinary aggregate with a 
character and a location.  This was nice and simple, but required a lot of 
memory.  Here is a back-of-the-napkin analysis, where the underlying cons-tree 
representation of each echar is understood as:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">vl-echar ::=  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CHAR.html">char</a> . (:vl-location . (filename . (line . col)))))</pre> 
 
<p>Assume we need no extra overhead to represent the filename, line, or column. 
This is fair: typically whole giant sets of echars all have their filename 
pointing to the same string, so we don't need extra memory for the file name. 
Furthermore, the line and column number are always fixnums in practice, i.e., 
they are immediates that don't take any extra space.  Then, the memory required 
for each echar is:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">4 conses = 128 bits * 4 = 512 bits = 64 bytes</pre> 
 
<p>But since echars generally go in a list, we usually also need 1 extra cons 
per character to join it to the rest of the list.  So, the total overhead just 
for echars is really more like 80 bytes.  In short, to read a file with N bytes 
in it we need 80N bytes of memory, so if we want to process a 100 MB Verilog 
file we need 8 GB of space!  (It's actually worse than this, because that's 
just the cost of reading the characters in the first place.  After that we have 
to preprocess them, which is basically an echarlist-to-echarlist 
transformation.  Preprocessing doesn't need to deeply copy the echars 
themselves, but it is still going to deeply copy the list, which means an extra 
16 bytes of overhead per character.  So we're up to 9.6 GB for a 100 MB file 
before reaching a good place where we can garbage collect.</p> 
 
<p>To reduce this overhead, we now use a more efficient encoding scheme.</p> 
 
<h3>Encoding Scheme</h3> 
 
<p>We will use a simple encoding that allows us to represent almost any 
practical echar as a single cons of an immediate onto a filename pointer.  We 
will assume we can represent any unsigned 60-bit number as a fixnum, which is 
true in 64-bit CCL.  This seems like plenty of space.  We divide it up, rather 
arbitrarily, as follows:</p> 
 
<ul> 
<li>8-bit character code, so we can represent any character code</li> 
<li>30-bit line number, so our maximum line number is ~1 billion</li> 
<li>22-bit column number, so our maximum column number is ~4 million</li> 
</ul> 
 
<p>It is hard to imagine hitting these limits in practice, but as a fallback we 
will simply allow any characters from locations outside this range to be 
represented as cons structures with line, column, and character code 
components.  This is no worse than our former representation, and means that 
the interface for constructing echars can be kept simple and bounds-free.</p>
