<p>Version of VL <a href="VL____SYNTAX.html">syntax</a> being used.</p><p>Occasionally VL's internal data structures change, e.g., to add new 
fields or adjust the way that some field is represented.  As a barbaric 
mechanism to make sure that we don't try to mix together translations produced 
by incompatible versions of VL, each <a href="VL____VL-DESIGN.html">vl-design</a> is annotated with a 
<span class="v">version</span> field that must match exactly this string.</p>
