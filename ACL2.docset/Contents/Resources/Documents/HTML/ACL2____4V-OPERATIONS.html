<p>Primitive operations in our four-valued logic.</p><p>This is a collection of operations on <a href="ACL2____4VP.html">4vp</a>s that are 
generally meant to model the behavior of particular, primitive kinds of 
circuits.  For instance, in the <a href="ACL2____ESIM.html">esim</a> hardware simulator, the <a href="ACL2____ESIM-PRIMITIVES.html">esim-primitives</a> are generally based on these operations.</p> 
 
<p>The operations here apply to four-valued constants and produce new 
four-valued constants as results.  If you are looking for operations that 
construct new <a href="ACL2____4V-SEXPRS.html">4v-sexprs</a>, see instead the <a href="ACL2____4VS-CONSTRUCTORS.html">4vs-constructors</a>.</p> 
 
<p>Note that all of these operations are <a href="ACL2____4V-MONOTONICITY.html">monotonic</a>.</p>
