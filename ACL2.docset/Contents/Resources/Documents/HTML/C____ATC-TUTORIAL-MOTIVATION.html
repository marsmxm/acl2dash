<p>ATC tutorial: Motivation for Generating C Code from ACL2.</p><p>(This page may be skipped at first reading.)</p><p>The motivation for generating C code from ACL2 is analogous to 
    the motivation for generating Java code from ACL2, 
    or for generating code in other programming language from ACL2. 
    The <a href="JAVA____ATJ-TUTORIAL-MOTIVATION.html">java::atj-tutorial-motivation</a> page 
    provides the general motivation, 
    in the context of Java: 
    it is recommended to read that page.</p><p>In addition, as a specific motivation for generating C code, 
    it should be noted that C is widely used in certain domains, 
    such as embedded systems. 
    Some of these C applications are relatively small in size 
    and have strong safety and security requirements, 
    making them an attractive target for (ACL2-based) formal methods.</p><div class="box"></div><p><b>Next:</b> <a href="C____ATC-TUTORIAL-ATJ-COMPARISON.html">Comparison with ATJ's Java code generation from ACL2</a></p>
