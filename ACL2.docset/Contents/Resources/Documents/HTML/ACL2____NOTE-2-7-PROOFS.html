<p>ACL2 Version  2.7 Notes on Changes in Proof Engine</p><p>An improvement in the linear arithmetic heuristics has been 
 provided by Robert Krug.  For information about this change, search for the 
 comment in <span class="v">add-linear-lemma</span> (file <span class="v">rewrite.lisp</span>) that begins as 
 follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">; Previous to Version_2.7, we just went ahead and used the result of</pre> 
 
 <p>Thanks, Robert!  Also thanks to Eric Smith for providing a motivating 
 example.</p> 
 
 <p>The non-linear-arithmetic addition (see <a href="ACL2____NON-LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">non-linear-arithmetic</a>) led 
 to several small changes in the linear-arithmetic decision procedure (see 
 <a href="ACL2____LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">linear-arithmetic</a>).  Two of these changes could affect existing 
 proofs.</p> 
 
 <blockquote> 
 
 <p>First, when we are setting up the initial arithmetic database (which we 
 call the ``pot-lst''), we have always scanned it to see if there were any 
 pairs of inequalities from which we could derive a previously unknown 
 equality.  In some cases we added this equality to the clause and in others we 
 used it to rewrite the clause, substituting one side of the equality for the 
 other throughout the clause.  Previously, the heuristics that we used to 
 determine whether we performed the substitution differed from those used in 
 several other places in the code.  This has now been regularized, and similar 
 heuristics are now used throughout the code.</p> 
 
 <p>The second change to the linear-arithmetic decision procedure is that we 
 now explicitly add inequalities derived from type reasoning to the pot-lst. 
 Previously, we performed cancellations against these inequalities without 
 adding them to the pot-lst.  This change results in there being more 
 inequalities in the pot-lst than before, and so more chances for there to be a 
 pair of inequalities from which an equality can be derived.  In effect, 
 certain simple consequences of the current goal (see <a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a>) may now 
 be added as hypotheses of the goal or used to perform equality 
 substitutions.</p> 
 
 </blockquote> 
 
 <p>A slight improvement has been made to the way certain rewrite rules are 
 stored.  It was already the case that a rewrite rule rule whose conclusion 
 <span class="v">C</span> is not a call of a known equivalence relation (or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQ.html">eq</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____EQL.html">eql</a></span>, or <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP_____D3.html">=</a></span>) is stored as <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IFF.html">iff</a> C t)</span>, except that if ACL2 can 
 determine (using its <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a></span> mechanism) that <span class="v">C</span> is Boolean, then 
 the rule is stored as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> C t)</span>.  The improvement is that if <span class="v">C</span> and 
 <span class="v">C'</span> are Boolean, then a rule stated as <span class="tt">(iff C C')</span> is stored as 
 <span class="tt">(equal C C')</span>.  Thanks to Pete Manolios for providing an example that 
 led us to consider this improvement.</p> 
 
 <p>The heuristic use of equalities (fertilization) has been modified. 
 Previously, ACL2 would sometimes substitute using an equality but keep the 
 equality, and then undo the substitution by using the equality again.  Now, 
 when ACL2 keeps an equality after using it, it puts the equality inside a call 
 of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a></span>.  Descendants of that goal that are unchanged by 
 simplification will have this call of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a></span> removed so that the 
 equality can once again contribute to the proof.  This change can cause some 
 proofs to succeed that otherwise would fail.  In the unlikely event that a 
 proof fails that formerly succeeded, the following hint on "Goal" may fix 
 the problem (see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>):</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">:expand ((:free (x) (<a href="ACL2____HIDE.html">hide</a> x)))</pre> 
 
 <p>We have refined the heuristics employed when an <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a></span> form is assumed 
 true or false.  Our previous attempt (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-6-PROOFS.html">note-2-6-proofs</a> for the 
 original announcement) was not as general as we had believed.  We have also 
 improved some low-level code responsible for rewriting <span class="v">IF</span> expressions. 
 In earlier versions of ACL2, it was possible to have the truth or falsity of 
 an <span class="v">IF</span> expression explicitly recorded in the type-alist, and yet not use 
 this information during rewriting.  This problem has been corrected.  Thanks 
 to Robert Krug for noticing this problem and implementing the fix.</p> 
 
 <p>We have sped up the rewriter in some cases where there are large 
 collections of mutually-recursive functions (see <a href="ACL2____MUTUAL-RECURSION.html">mutual-recursion</a>). 
 (Implementation notes: technically, we have modified the way function 
 <span class="v">being-openedp</span> operates on the <span class="v">fnstack</span>, and we have modified 
 <span class="v">*current-acl2-world-key-ordering*</span> as described in the essay above its 
 definition.)</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">Forward-chaining</a> is now done in the preprocessing phase of proof 
 attempts (see the discussion of <span class="v">:DO-NOT</span> â€” see <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>).  This 
 is part of a technical change, made in support of translation of type 
 declarations to <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s (see <a href="ACL2____NOTE-2-7-GUARDS.html">note-2-7-guards</a>).  Previously, 
 whenever ACL2 checked for <a href="ACL2____BUILT-IN-CLAUSE.html">built-in-clause</a>s, it then looked for a 
 contradiction using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TYPE-SET.html">type-set</a></span> reasoning if it did not find a suitable 
 built-in clause.  The change is to perform forward-chaining in such cases 
 (i.e., when a built-in clause is not found).</p> 
 
 <p>A couple of changes have been made in the generation of goals for <a href="ACL2____FORCING-ROUND.html">forcing-round</a>s.  Thanks to Eric Smith for bringing issues to our attention 
 that led to these changes.  For one, <a href="ACL2____GUARD.html">guard</a>s are no longer relevant in 
 such goal generation.  Formerly, the addition of a guard could make a proof 
 fail that otherwise succeeded.  Secondly, contextual information is now always 
 kept when it involves a constrained constant, i.e., a zero-ary function 
 introduced in the signature of an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span>.</p>
