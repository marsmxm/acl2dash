  <p>To be accepted with rule-class <span class="v">:rewrite-quoted-constant</span> a conjecture 
  must have one of the following three</p> 
  <pre class="code">General Forms:

(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> hyps (equiv 'const1 'const2))        ; [1]

(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> hyps (equiv (fn var) var))           ; [2]

(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">IMPLIES</a> hyps (equiv (constructor ...) rhs))  ; [3]</pre> 
 
  <p>where</p> 
  <ul> 
 
  <li>
<span class="v">hyps</span> is a term (typically a conjunction) and may include <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></span> hypotheses with the usual semantics,</li> 
 
  <li>
<span class="v">equiv</span> is a known <a href="ACL2____EQUIVALENCE.html">equivalence</a> relation and, in the case of 
  <span class="v">[1]</span> and <span class="v">[2]</span>, <span class="v">equiv</span> is not <span class="v">EQUAL</span>,</li> 
 
  <li>
<span class="v">var</span>, in form <span class="v">[2]</span>, is a variable symbol, and</li> 
 
  <li> <span class="v">constructor</span>, in form <span class="v">[3]</span>, is an explicit value ``constructor'' 
  function symbol listed in <span class="v">*one-way-unify1-implicit-fns*</span>.  The list just 
  mentioned includes <span class="v">cons</span>, which can be used to match non-empty list 
  constants, <span class="v">coerce</span>, which can match string constants, 
  <span class="v">intern-in-package-of-symbol</span>, which can match symbol constants, and 
  <span class="v">binary-+</span> and certain other arithmetic primitives which can match numeric 
  constants.  See <a href="ACL2____RANDOM-REMARKS-ON-REWRITING.html">random-remarks-on-rewriting</a> for some examples.</li> 
 
  </ul> 
 
  <p>The function, <span class="v">fn</span>, in a form <span class="v">[2]</span> rule is called the 
  ``normalizer.''  We explain this terminology as we discuss how such rules are 
  used.</p> 
 
  <p>The <span class="v">:rewrite-quoted-constant</span> rule-class is permitted to specify a 
  <span class="v">:corollary</span> and/or a <span class="v">:loop-stopper</span>, with the usual syntax and 
  meaning.  See <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a></span>.  Note that for forms <span class="v">[1]</span> and 
  <span class="v">[2]</span> above a <span class="v">:</span><span class="v">loop-stopper</span> is probably irrelevant as the forms 
  do not usually contain multiple variable symbols.</p> 
 
  <p>Once a <span class="v">:rewrite-quoted-constant</span> rule is proved and stored, the 
  rewriter behaves as follows.  When a quoted constant is encountered as the 
  target term to be rewritten, the rewriter considers each enabled 
  <span class="v">:rewrite-quoted-constant</span> rule (most-recent first), looking for those 
  whose <span class="v">equiv</span> refines (see <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REFINEMENT.html">refinement</a></span>) the equivalence 
  relation being maintained by the rewriter for the given occurrence of the 
  target.  The rewriter tries to apply each such rule in turn (as described 
  below) and replaces the target by the rewritten result of the first 
  applicable rule.</p> 
 
  <p>A rule applies if the ``pattern'' (see below) in the conclusion 
  ``matches'' the quoted constant and the <span class="v">hyps</span> can be relieved in the 
  usual sense, including the treatment of free variables, pragmatic directives 
  like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____FORCE.html">force</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SYNTAXP.html">syntaxp</a></span>, and heuristics such as those 
  controlled by any <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOOP-STOPPER.html">loop-stopper</a></span> options in the rule-class or 
  <span class="v">:</span><span class="v">restrict</span> <a href="ACL2____HINTS.html">hints</a>.  If these conditions are met, the quoted 
  constant is replaced by the ``result.''  But the exact meanings of 
  ``pattern,'' ``match'' and ``result'', here, are a little different from their 
  meanings for ordinary <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rules and depend on which of the three 
  forms is being applied.</p> 
 
  <ul> 
 
  <li>A form <span class="v">[1]</span> rule, whose conclusion is <span class="v">(equiv 'const1 'const2)</span>, 
  has <span class="v">'const1</span> as its pattern and that pattern matches the target constant 
  <span class="v">'const</span> only when <span class="v">const1</span> is exactly <span class="v">const</span>.  The result is 
  <span class="v">'const2</span>.  Note that it is impossible to prove a form <span class="v">[1]</span> rule whose 
  equivalence is <span class="v">equal</span> unless the two constants are identical, so we 
  disallow that case.</li> 
 
  <li>A form <span class="v">[2]</span> rule, whose conclusion is <span class="v">(equiv (fn var) var)</span>, is 
  most easily understood by swapping the roles of left- and right-hand sides of 
  its conclusion.  Its pattern is the right-hand side, <span class="v">var</span>, and its result 
  is derived from the left-hand side, <span class="v">(fn var)</span>.  The reason we use the 
  form shown here is so that the same conjecture might also be used as an 
  ordinary <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule without forcing the user to type a 
  <span class="v">:corollary</span> with the sides swapped.  Since form <span class="v">[2]</span> rules have a 
  variable as the pattern they will match any quoted constant, <span class="v">'const</span>, by 
  binding <span class="v">var</span> to <span class="v">'const</span>.  The result is the quoted constant, if any, 
  obtained by rewriting <span class="v">(fn var)</span> under that binding of <span class="v">var</span>.  If that 
  rewrite does not result in a constant, no replacement is made, i.e., it is as 
  though the rule did not match.  Note that it is pointless to prove a form 
  <span class="v">[2]</span> rule whose equivalence is <span class="v">equal</span> because it would replace a 
  quoted constant by itself, so we disallow that equivalence. 
 
   <br> 
   <br> 
 
  Intuitively, <span class="v">fn</span> is a function that normalizes every member of the 
  <span class="v">equiv</span> equivalence class: given a constant that is a member of the class 
  it returns its ``normal'' form.  That is why we call <span class="v">fn</span> the 
  ``normalizer'' for <span class="v">equiv</span>.  However, you do not have to prove anything 
  like normality or canonicality; you just have to prove that <span class="v">fn</span> returns a 
  member of the class.  Having several different normalizers is possible but it 
  is best if only one is enabled at a time. 
 
   <br> 
   <br> 
 
  When <span class="v">var</span> is bound to a constant, the rewriter will first try to reduce 
  <span class="v">(fn var)</span> to a constant by simple evaluation.  If that fails, it tries 
  using lemmas.  If the normalizer or one of its subfunctions is disabled or is 
  non-executable or has a disabled executable counterpart the attempt to simply 
  evaluate <span class="v">(fn var)</span> (under the assignment of <span class="v">'const</span> to <span class="v">var</span>) may 
  fail.  That is why full-blown rewriting of <span class="v">(fn var)</span> is tried instead. 
  It might happen that evaluation fails but lemmas produce a constant. 
 
   <br> 
   <br> 
 
  <b>The fact that form <span class="v">[2]</span> rules are used ``backwards,'' with the roles 
  of the left- and right-hand sides swapped, has some ramifications worth 
  noting.</b> First, you can also classify the same formula as a <span class="v">:rewrite</span> 
  rule (but of course as such it won't rewrite quoted constants); as a 
  <span class="v">:rewrite</span> rule it rewrites instances of <span class="v">(fn var)</span> to the 
  corresponding instance of <span class="v">var</span>.  Second, when a 
  <span class="v">:rewrite-quoted-constant</span> rule is added, the new rule is compared to old 
  rules for subsumption and warning messages are generated; however form 
  <span class="v">[2]</span> rules are omitted from this subsumption check because their patterns 
  match every constant (in the equivalence class).  Third, if you inspect a 
  form <span class="v">[2]</span> rule with <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PR.html">pr</a></span>, it reports the actual syntax typed, e.g., 
  the ``<span class="v">Lhs</span>'' is <span class="v">(fn var)</span> and the ``<span class="v">Rhs</span>'' is <span class="v">var</span>.  But, if 
  you <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____MONITOR.html">monitor</a></span> a form <span class="v">[2]</span> rule and then interact with the 
  resulting <a href="ACL2____BREAK-REWRITE.html">break-rewrite</a> you will see that the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BRR-COMMANDS.html">brr-commands</a></span> 
  <span class="v">:lhs</span> and <span class="v">:rhs</span> report the swapped results.  That is, in the break, 
  <span class="v">:lhs</span> will be <span class="v">var</span> and <span class="v">:rhs</span> will be <span class="v">(fn var)</span>.  This is 
  different from the display by <span class="v">pr</span> because <span class="v">pr</span> reports the actual 
  syntax but interactive breaks report how the rule is being used.  We think 
  the interactive user, out of long habit, will type <span class="v">:lhs</span> to see the 
  pattern being matched and we did not think it wise to add a special command 
  just to see the pattern in a form <span class="v">[2]</span> rule.  Fourth, if a form <span class="v">[2]</span> 
  rule is mentioned in the report by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PL.html">pl</a></span> the ``New term'' is reported to 
  be <span class="v">(fn 'const)</span>, however replacement of <span class="v">'const</span> occurs only if <span class="v">(fn
  'const)</span> reduces to a quoted constant by rewriting.</li> 
 
  <li>A form <span class="v">[3]</span> rule, whose conclusion is <span class="v">(equiv (constructor ...)
  rhs)</span>, matches the constant <span class="v">'const</span> provided <span class="v">'const</span> is an instance 
  of <span class="v">(constructor ...)</span> under some variable substitution <span class="v">s</span>.  We 
  illustrate cases where quoted constants are instances of ``constructor'' 
  terms below and in <a href="ACL2____RANDOM-REMARKS-ON-REWRITING.html">random-remarks-on-rewriting</a>.  Note that form 
  <span class="v">[3]</span> rules allow the equivalence relation to be <span class="v">equal</span>.  Use of 
  <span class="v">equal</span> here could cause looping rewrites if the <span class="v">rhs</span> reduces to a 
  constant.  But we allow it because, as noted below, such a rule will also 
  permit you to rewrite a quoted constant into an equivalent term that is not a 
  quoted constant.</li> 
 
  </ul> 
 
  <p>It is important to realize that form <span class="v">[1]</span> and form <span class="v">[3]</span> rules only 
  apply to the top-level of a quoted constant.  We discuss this at length 
  because it can cause some confusion.  The examples below are drawn from the 
  community book <span class="v">books/demos/rewrite-quoted-constant-examples</span>.  That book 
  introduces <span class="v">set-equalp</span> as an equivalence relation and proves various 
  <span class="v">:rewrite-quoted-constant</span> rules to rearrange the quoted constants 
  occurring in <span class="v">set-equalp</span> contexts.  Assume all the quoted constants 
  mentioned below occur in <span class="v">set-equalp</span> contexts.</p> 
 
  <p>The form <span class="v">[1]</span> rule <span class="v">(set-equalp 77 nil)</span> will not cause <span class="v">'(1 2 3
  . 77)</span> to rewrite to <span class="v">'(1 2 3)</span>.  Because ACL2 applications frequently 
  involve huge quoted list constants, we believe that making the rewriter 
  explore them down to the tips would be prohibitively expensive.</p> 
 
  <p>However, form <span class="v">[2]</span> rules, of the general form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____IMPLIES.html">implies</a>
  hyps (equiv (fn var) var))</span>, allow the normalizer to be applied to every 
  quoted constant occuring in a suitable <span class="v">equiv</span> context.  The normalizer 
  can then do a root-and-branch exploration of the constant to compute its 
  replacement.</p> 
 
  <p>For example, the <span class="v">rewrite-quoted-constants-examples</span> book cited above 
  defines the normalizer <span class="v">(drop-dups-and-sort var)</span> to coerce its argument 
  to a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a></span>, eliminate duplicate elements, and sort the remaining 
  elements.  It then proves the form <span class="v">[2]</span> rule 
  <span class="v">(set-equalp (drop-dups-and-sort var) var)</span>.  Now consider how this rule 
  is used when the rewriter encounters <span class="v">'(3 1 1 2 . 77)</span> in a 
  <span class="v">set-equalp</span> context.  First, <span class="v">var</span> is bound to <span class="v">'const</span>.  Then, the 
  rewriter tries to relieve the instantiated hypotheses of the rule, if any. 
  The example rule here has no hypotheses.  But you can provide some and 
  perhaps use them to prevent calling the normalizer on this particular 
  constant.  Since <span class="v">var</span> is bound to the constant <span class="v">'const</span> such 
  hypotheses can usually just be computed.  Supposing the hypotheses are 
  relieved, the rewriter then rewrites <span class="v">(drop-dups-and-sort 'const)</span>.  Under 
  the most common circumstance, this just causes your normalizer function, here 
  <span class="v">drop-dups-and-sort</span>, to execute on the given constant.  (If you have 
  verified the guard of the normalizer and <span class="v">'const</span> satisfies the guard, 
  then the execution is in the underlying raw Common Lisp.)  In the most common 
  circumstance, the function will return an explicit constant.  If that 
  returned value is indeed a constant (and different from <span class="v">'const</span>), the 
  rewriter replaces this occurrence of <span class="v">'const</span> by the returned value. 
  Otherwise the rule does not apply.</p> 
 
  <p>As noted earlier, form <span class="v">[3]</span> rules are only applied at the top-level of 
  a quoted constant.  For example, the rule <span class="v">(set-equalp (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x y) (my-cons
  x y))</span> will not cause <span class="v">'(1 2 3)</span> to rewrite to <span class="v">(my-cons 1 (my-cons
  2 (my-cons 3 nil)))</span> in <span class="v">set-equalp</span> contexts.  Instead, it would produce 
  <span class="v">(my-cons 1 '(2 3))</span>.</p> 
 
  <p>But since the rewriter will eventually be called on that term, and since 
  that term contains another top-level quoted constant, namely <span class="v">'(2 3)</span>, you 
  might expect the rule to eventually be used to replace <span class="v">'(2 3)</span> by 
  <span class="v">(my-cons 2 '(3))</span>.  Indeed, that is what happens -- if you have proved 
  that <span class="v">set-equalp</span> is a <a href="ACL2____CONGRUENCE.html">congruence</a> for the second argument of 
  <span class="v">my-cons</span>, maintaining <span class="v">set-equalp</span>.  However, for technical reasons 
  explained in comments in the book <span class="v">rewrite-quoted-constant-examples</span>, each 
  rewrite occurs in a separate simplification step.  So turning <span class="v">'(1 2 3)</span> 
  into <span class="v">(my-cons 1 (my-cons 2 (my-cons 3 nil)))</span> requires three 
  simplification steps.  If the rule in question were <span class="v">(set-equalp (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x
  y) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> x (<a href="ACL2____DOUBLE-REWRITE.html">double-rewrite</a> y)))</span> it would happen in one simplification step. 
  See <span class="v">double-rewrite</span> and the examples in the book 
  <span class="v">rewrite-quoted-constant-examples</span>.</p>
