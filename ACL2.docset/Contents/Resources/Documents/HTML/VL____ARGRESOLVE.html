<p>Converts named argument lists into plain argument lists, and 
annotates each plain argument with its direction.</p><p>We prefer to use plain (or positional) argument lists as our 
internal representation for module and gate instances.</p> 
 
<p>We have little choice but to support plain argument lists internally, 
because the are the only way to instantiate gates and are also the only way to 
instantiate modules with ports like <span class="v">foo[3:0]</span> without external names.  But 
it is basically straightforward to eliminate all named argument lists by 
replacing them with their plain equivalents, reducing the number of syntactic 
constructs that later transformations need to deal with.</p> 
 
<p>In this transformation, we simplify module instances as follows:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We try to expand out any SystemVerilog <span class="v">.*</span>-style port connections,</li> 
 
<li>We try to get rid of all the named argument lists by replacing them with 
plain argument lists; see <a href="VL____VL-CONVERT-NAMEDARGS.html">vl-convert-namedargs</a>,</li> 
 
<li>We try to annotate each <a href="VL____VL-PLAINARG-P.html">vl-plainarg-p</a> with its <span class="v">dir</span> and 
<span class="v">portname</span> fields, so that the direction and name of many ports will be 
available for use in error messages; see <a href="VL____VL-ANNOTATE-PLAINARGS.html">vl-annotate-plainargs</a>,</li> 
 
<li>We check that each module instance has the proper arity, and</li> 
 
<li>We check that any "blank" ports are connected only to blank arguments, 
and vice-versa; see <a href="VL____VL-CHECK-BLANKARGS.html">vl-check-blankargs</a>.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>We also simplify gate instances as follows:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>We check that the arity of each gate instance is acceptable and annotate 
each <a href="VL____VL-PLAINARG-P.html">vl-plainarg-p</a> with its <span class="v">dir</span> field; see <a href="VL____VL-GATEINST-DIRASSIGN.html">vl-gateinst-dirassign</a>, and</li> 
 
<li>We check that no "blank" arguments are given to gates, and issue a 
warning if such a connection is made.  This is actually also done by <a href="VL____VL-GATEINST-DIRASSIGN.html">vl-gateinst-dirassign</a>, just because it is convenient.</li> 
 
</ul>
