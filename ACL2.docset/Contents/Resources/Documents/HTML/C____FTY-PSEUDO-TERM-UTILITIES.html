<p>FTY utilities for pseudo-terms.</p><p>Many system utilities, e.g. built-in and in <a href="ACL2____STD_F2SYSTEM.html">Std/system</a>, are written using the built-in ACL2 term API. 
     When using these system utilities 
     in code that uses the <a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-FTY.html">FTY term API</a>, there may be a slight ``mismatch'', 
     e.g. in the way the two APIs fix non-terms, 
     or in the fact that, for termination, 
     the ACL2 API is based on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a></span> 
     while the FTY API is based on <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-COUNT.html">pseudo-term-count</a></span>.</p><p>The mismatch can be bridged by introducing 
     simple wrappers of those system utilities 
     that fix the term (in the FTY way) and then call the utilities. 
     Here we provide a number of such wrappers, 
     which should be eventually moved to a more central place.</p><p>The wrappers are accompanied by theorems 
     leveraged from the wrapped utilities. 
     This way the wrappers can be left disabled in code that uses them.</p><p>The <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a></span> vs. <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-COUNT.html">pseudo-term-count</a></span> issue 
     requires a bit more work. 
     Suppose we have a utility that returns results 
     that are <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a></span>-smaller than its arguments 
     (under suitable conditions). 
     In order to prove that the wrapper returns results 
     that are <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-COUNT.html">pseudo-term-count</a></span>-smaller than its arguments, 
     we cannot leverage the theorems about <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">ACL2-count</a></span>. 
     Instead, we need to enable the utilities to prove the theorems, 
     and we also need to enable some FTY pseudo-term operations, 
     because we need to break the FTY pseudo-term abstraction: 
     we use this approach to prove theorems 
     about the original utilities and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-COUNT.html">pseudo-term-count</a></span> 
     under <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> assumptions, 
     from which then the desired theorems about the wrappers readily follow. 
     The theorems about the original utilities and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERM-COUNT.html">pseudo-term-count</a></span> 
     are useful to prove the analogous theorems of utilities that call them.</p>
