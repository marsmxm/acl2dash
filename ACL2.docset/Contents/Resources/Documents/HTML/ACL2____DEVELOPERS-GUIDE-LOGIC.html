<p>Logical Considerations</p><p>This Developer's Guide may give the impression that ACL2 
 maintenance is primarily a programming exercise, and that is probably true. 
 However, <font color="#c00000">there are some subtle logical 
 considerations</font> that need to be considered when working with some parts 
 of the implementation.  This topic addresses an assortment of such 
 considerations, often by pointing to source code comments.  Additional reading 
 for those intrigued by logic is the paper: ``Structured Theory Development for 
 a Mechanized Logic,'' Matt Kaufmann and J Strother Moore, Journal of Automated 
 Reasoning 26, no. 2 (2001), pp. 161--203.</p> 
 
 <p><b>Note:</b> <font color="#c00000">The examples below are by no means 
 comprehensive!</font> You are encouraged to extend this documentation topic 
 with additional logical considerations as they arise.  Also see the Essay on 
 Soundness Threats.</p> 
 
 <h3>Histories, chronologies, and theories</h3> 
 
 <p>An ACL2 session has at least three logical interpretations, as follows.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>The corresponding <font color="#c00000"><i>history</i></font>, which is 
 the sequence of all <i>axiomatic <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a></i> from the session: this 
 includes <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span>, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFCHOOSE.html">defchoose</a></span>, and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span> events, as 
 well as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> events with non-empty <a href="ACL2____SIGNATURE.html">signature</a>s.  It does 
 not include <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> events.</li> 
 
 <li>The corresponding <font color="#c00000"><i>chronology</i></font>, which is 
 the sequence of all events from the session with logical content.  Thus the 
 history is a subsequence of the chronology, but the chronology also includes 
 <span class="v">defthm</span> events.</li> 
 
 <li>The corresponding <font color="#c00000"><i>theory</i></font> of the 
 session, which is the first-order theory of its history, that is, axiomatized 
 by the formulas in its history.  (Careful: This theory is not sensitive to 
 which runes are enabled, unlike the macro, <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CURRENT-THEORY.html">current-theory</a></span>.)  A basic 
 property of ACL2 is that all formulas in the session's chronology are provable 
 in the session's theory.  In particular, by restricting to the chronology of 
 events up to and including a given <span class="v">defthm</span> event, we see that the formula 
 of that event is provable from the axiomatic events that precede it.</li> 
 
 </ul> 
 
 <font color="#c00000"> 
 
 <p>When a session <span class="v">S1</span> is extended to a session <span class="v">S2</span> without using 
 <span class="v">defaxiom</span> events, then the theory <span class="v">T2</span> for <span class="v">S2</span> is a <i>conservative 
 extension</i> of the theory <span class="v">T1</span> for <span class="v">S1</span>: that is, every theorem of 
 <span class="v">T2</span> whose function symbols all occur in <span class="v">T1</span> — that is, are all 
 introduced in <span class="v">S1</span> — is a theorem of <span class="v">T1</span>.  An important corollary 
 is that if a session has no <span class="v">defaxiom</span> events, then its theory is 
 consistent.</p> 
 
 </font> 
 
 <p>Note that <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFATTACH.html">defattach</a></span> events are ignored for all three notions listed 
 above.  There is also a notion of <i>evaluation theory</i>, which is the 
 extension of the session's theory by the equations that equate each function 
 with its attachment.  A basic property is that every evaluation theory built 
 from a session free of <span class="v">defaxiom</span> events is the theory of some history that 
 is free of <span class="v">defaxiom</span> events, and thus (by the corollary stated in the 
 preceding paragraph) is consistent.  For a detailed development of theory 
 supporting the use of <span class="v">defattach</span> (though this can probably ignored unless 
 you are doing deep work with <span class="v">defattach</span>), see the source code comment, 
 ``Essay on Defattach.''</p> 
 
 <p>There is also a logical explanation for <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____APPLY_42.html">apply$</a></span>, which is based on 
 the notion of evaluation theory mentioned above for <span class="v">defattach</span>.  The 
 upshot is that a certain construction, the ``doppelganger construction'', 
 produces an evaluation theory in which every <a href="ACL2____WARRANT.html">warrant</a> is valid.  For 
 detailed theoretical justification (probably not necessary for most 
 developers, unless perhaps they are doing deep modifications pertaining to 
 <span class="v">defattach</span> or <span class="v">apply$</span>), see the source code comment, ``Essay on 
 Admitting a Model for Apply$ and the Functions that Use It.''</p> 
 
 <h3><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">Local</a></span></h3> 
 
 <font color="#800080"> 
 <p>IN THIS SECTION WE CAN FOCUS MAINLY ON THE DISPLAYS.</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <font color="#c00000"> 
 
 <p>Many soundness bugs in past versions of ACL2 — indeed, perhaps the 
 majority of them — can be attributed to a subtle mishandling of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span> <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a>.  Perhaps the only advice possible in this regard is the 
 following: Think carefully about the effects of <span class="v">local</span> when making 
 event-level changes to ACL2!</p> 
 
 </font> 
 
 <p>Consider for example the following, seemingly innocuous ``enhancement'': 
 allow <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS.html">verify-guards</a></span> to comprehend macro-aliases (see <a href="ACL2____MACRO-ALIASES-TABLE.html">macro-aliases-table</a>).  Such an ``enhancement'' would be unsound!  Instead, a 
 similar but sound enhancement, <span class="v">verify-guards+</span>, was introduced (into 
 Version 6.3).  <font color="#c00000">See <a href="ACL2____VERIFY-GUARDS_B2.html">verify-guards+</a> for an example, 
 using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a></span> and <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a></span>, for why such an enhancement to 
 <span class="v">verify-guards</span> would be unsound.</font></p> 
 
 <p>We turn now to discuss a key mechanism for avoiding potential soundness 
 issues caused by <span class="v">local</span>: the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>.  Because of the 
 logical information stored in this <a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a>, it is prohibited to modify 
 this table locally, as we illustrate with a couple of examples.  First 
 consider the following introduction of a <a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a>-mode function, <span class="v">f</span>, 
 that clearly is inadmissible in <a href="ACL2____LOGIC.html">logic</a>-mode.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
  ()
  (<a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a>)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f () (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (f))))</pre> 
 
 <p>If the <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a>)</span> event were allowed to be local, then the second pass 
 of the <span class="v">encapsulate</span> event would introduce <span class="v">f</span> in logic-mode, creating 
 an inconsistent theory!</p> 
 
 <p>A slightly more subtle example is the following.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
  ()
  (<a href="ACL2____SET-RULER-EXTENDERS.html">set-ruler-extenders</a> :all)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)) x)
          3)))</pre> 
 
 <p>The induction scheme stored for <span class="v">foo</span> is as follows, which is the same 
 as would be stored for the simpler definition, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a>
 x) (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)) x))</span>.  (Don't worry about the form of the structure below. 
 Further relevant discussion may be found below in the section, ``Induction, 
 recursion, and termination.'')</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____GETPROPC.html">getpropc</a> 'foo 'induction-machine)
((TESTS-AND-CALLS ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X))
                  (FOO (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">CDR</a> X)))
 (TESTS-AND-CALLS ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)))))
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>The <span class="v">'induction-machine</span> property is computed based on the 
 ruler-extenders.  So if the event <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-RULER-EXTENDERS.html">set-ruler-extenders</a> :all)</span> above could 
 be made local, we would be storing the same induction machine as for the 
 following definition.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> foo (x)
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :measure (<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> x)))
   (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (foo (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)) x)
         3)))</pre> 
 
 <p>But that induction-machine is unsound!</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a> nil :hints (("Goal" :induct (foo x))))</pre> 
 
 <p>The two examples above illustrate the importance of thinking about whether 
 an event can soundly be local.  If not, then it may be best for that event to 
 be one that sets the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____ACL2-DEFAULTS-TABLE.html">ACL2-defaults-table</a></span>, like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PROGRAM.html">program</a></span> and 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SET-RULER-EXTENDERS.html">set-ruler-extenders</a></span>, since <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TABLE.html">table</a></span> events that set the 
 <span class="v">acl2-defaults-table</span> are not permitted to be local.</p> 
 
 <h3>
<span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">Skip-proofs</a></span> vs. <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>
</h3> 
 
 <font color="#800080"> 
 <p>IN THE WORKSHOP THE FOCUS WILL BE ONLY ON THE LOGICAL DIFFERENCE.</p> 
 </font> 
 
 <p>There is a fundamental logical difference between wrapping <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> around a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event and using <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>.  When 
 using <span class="v">skip-proofs</span>, the user is promising that the ensuing proof 
 obligations are indeed theorems of the theory of the current ACL2 session. 
 However, the meaning of <span class="v">defaxiom</span> is to extend that theory with a new 
 axiom, one which is generally not provable from the session's theory.  See 
 <a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a> and see <a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a>.  This logical distinction has 
 ramifications for the implementation, as we now describe.</p> 
 
 <p>Since the use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a></span> carries an implicit promise of 
 provability, the implementation can largely ignore the question of whether an 
 event was, or was not, introduced using <span class="v">skip-proofs</span>.  The key reason to 
 do any such tracking is to inform <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> when the use of keyword 
 argument <span class="v">:skip-proofs-okp t</span> is required.</p> 
 
 <p>On the other hand, it is critical for soundness to track the use of <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a></span>.  In particular, it is unsound to allow <a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> <span class="v">defaxiom</span> 
 events.  That is obvious from the following example, which would leave us in 
 an ACL2 world in which <span class="v">nil</span> is provable even though there is no 
 <span class="v">defaxiom</span> event in that world.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
  ()
  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____DEFAXIOM.html">defaxiom</a> bad-axiom nil :rule-classes nil))
  (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bad-theorem nil
    :hints (("Goal" :use bad-axiom))
    :rule-classes nil))</pre> 
 
 <p>That event is, of course, rejected by ACL2.  The following, on the other 
 hand, is accepted; but this does not demonstrate unsoundness of ACL2, because 
 the user violated the implied promise that, quoting from above, ``the ensuing 
 proof obligations are indeed theorems of the theory of the current ACL2 
 session.''</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____ENCAPSULATE.html">encapsulate</a>
  ()
  (<a href="ACL2____LOCAL.html">local</a> (<a href="ACL2____SKIP-PROOFS.html">skip-proofs</a> (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bad-axiom nil :rule-classes nil)))
  (<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> bad-theorem nil
    :hints (("Goal" :use bad-axiom))
    :rule-classes nil))</pre> 
 
 <p>We conclude this section by noting that there are different ``levels'' of 
 <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> used by the implementation that are not directly visible to 
 the user.  The basic <span class="v">skip-proofs</span> you see around an event generates a 
 binding of state global <span class="v">'ld-skip-proofsp</span> to <span class="v">t</span>.  However, when you 
 include a book, state global <span class="v">'ld-skip-proofsp</span> is bound to 
 <span class="v">'include-book</span>, which has two major effects: <span class="v">local</span> events are 
 skipped, and some checks are omitted.  For example, the redundancy checks 
 normally performed after <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____SET-ENFORCE-REDUNDANCY.html">set-enforce-redundancy</a> t)</span> are, as one would 
 hope, omitted when including a book.  If you tags-search the sources for 
 ``<span class="v">(enforce-redundancy</span>'', you'll see that it is used to implement 
 events (see for example the definition of <span class="v">defconst-fn</span>); then if you look 
 at the definition of <span class="v">enforce-redundancy</span>, you'll see that its check is 
 skipped when state global <span class="v">'ld-skip-proofsp</span> is bound to 
 <span class="v">'include-book</span>, hence when a book is being included.  Also see <a href="ACL2____LD-SKIP-PROOFSP.html">ld-skip-proofsp</a>.</p> 
 
 <h3>Induction, recursion, and termination</h3> 
 
 <p>Every proposed definition with recursion generates two related artifacts: a 
 proof obligation that is generally described as the termination proof 
 obligation, and an induction scheme to be stored if the definition is 
 admitted.  <font color="#c00000">A key soundness requirement is that the 
 termination proof obligation justifies use of the induction scheme.</font> 
 This produces a tension, as can be seen by the analysis below of the following 
 example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)) (f (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)) x)
            x)
    x))</pre> 
 
 <p>The generated induction is displayed symbolically just below: when proving 
 a proposition <span class="v">(P x)</span>, the induction step is to assume <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)</span> and 
 <span class="v">(P (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span> when proving <span class="v">(P x)</span>, and the base case is to assume 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x))</span> when proving <span class="v">(P x)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____GETPROPC.html">getpropc</a> 'f 'induction-machine)
((TESTS-AND-CALLS ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X))
                  (F (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)))
 (TESTS-AND-CALLS ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)))))
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>There is a comment just above the <span class="v">defrec</span> for <span class="v">tests-and-calls</span> that 
 explains that record structure.  The corresponding termination 
 scheme may be seen by evaluating <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRACE_42.html">trace$</a> termination-machine)</span> before 
 submitting the <span class="v">defun</span> form above.  Here is the result.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">&lt;1 (TERMINATION-MACHINE ((TESTS-AND-CALL ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X))
                                         (F (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>What this means is that ACL2 must prove that under the hypothesis <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a>
 x)</span>, then <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span> is smaller than <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> x)</span>. 
 That proof obligation clearly justifies the induction scheme described 
 above.</p> 
 
 <p>But let us try an experiment in which ACL2 is instructed to consider, for 
 termination and induction, any <span class="v">IF</span>-tests that are not at the top level 
 — in this case, within the call of <span class="v">cons</span>.  In a fresh session, we 
 try this instead.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> f (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :ruler-extenders (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a>)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)) (f (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)) x)
            x)
    x))</pre> 
 
 <p>The induction machine produced this time includes the extra <span class="v">if</span> test or 
 its negation.  It says that when proving a proposition <span class="v">(P x)</span>, the 
 induction step is to assume <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)</span>, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span>, and 
 <span class="v">(P (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span> when proving <span class="v">(P x)</span>; one base case is to assume <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a>
 x)</span> and <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)))</span> when proving <span class="v">(P x)</span>; and the other 
 base case is to assume <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x))</span> when proving <span class="v">(P x)</span>.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____GETPROPC.html">getpropc</a> 'f 'induction-machine)
((TESTS-AND-CALLS ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)))
                  (F (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)))

 (TESTS-AND-CALLS ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">NOT</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X)))))
ACL2 !&gt;</pre> 
 
 <p>This time there is a different termination proof obligation as well, 
 stating that <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)</span> has a smaller <span class="v">acl2-count</span> than that of <span class="v">x</span> 
 under the conjunction of the pair of assumptions <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)</span> and 
 <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span>.  As before, it justifies the induction scheme just 
 above.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">&lt;1 (TERMINATION-MACHINE ((TESTS-AND-CALL ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X) (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)))
                                         (F (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>Now suppose that the implementation is careless, by making the <a href="ACL2____RULER-EXTENDERS.html">ruler-extenders</a> affect the termination proof obligations but not the 
 induction scheme.  Consider the following example.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> g (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :ruler-extenders (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a>)))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONS.html">cons</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x) (<a href="ACL2____G.html">g</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x)) x)
        x))</pre> 
 
 <p>This produces the termination proof obligation represented as follows 
 (again from a trace), which says that assuming <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)</span>, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a>
 (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> x))</span> is less than <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____ACL2-COUNT.html">acl2-count</a> x)</span>.  Note that this is indeed a 
 theorem.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">&lt;1 (TERMINATION-MACHINE ((TESTS-AND-CALL ((<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">CONSP</a> X))
                                         (<a href="ACL2____G.html">G</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">CAR</a> X)))))</pre> 
 
 <p>To see what the induction scheme would be if we ignored the 
 ruler-extenders, we submit the following.</p>

 <p>The corresponding induction machine states that to prove <span class="v">(P x)</span>, we may

 <p>If we let <span class="v">(P x)</span> be <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)</span>, then clearly this induction scheme 
 allows us to prove <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)</span> for all <span class="v">x</span>!</p>

 <p>This induction scheme is thus clearly unsound.</p> 
 
 <p>The moral of the story is this: As the termination machine is modified to 
 accommodate the ruler-extenders, the induction machine must be modified 
 accordingly.  More generally, and as already noted: The termination machine 
 must justify the induction machine.</p> 
 
 <h3>Other tricky stuff</h3> 
 
 <p>The logical underpinnings of ACL2 can be a bit overwhelming when considered 
 together, so the following paragraphs should be taken as a suggestion for what 
 to explore only when you're in the mood for some logic, and also as an 
 acknowledgment that many subtle logical issues exist.  It is <i>NOT</i> meant 
 as a prescription for what you need to explore!  Moreover, it is far from 
 complete.</p> 
 
 <p>The foundations of metatheoretic reasoning can be challenging.  If you 
 tags-search for ``; Essay on Metafunction Support'', you'll see two relevant 
 essays.  But a much longer essay is the ``Essay on Correctness of Meta 
 Reasoning''.  That essay even ties into the ``Essay on Defattach'', at the 
 mention of the Attachment Restriction Lemma.  If you decide to change the 
 handling of metafunctions or clause-processors or their corresponding <a href="ACL2____RULE-CLASSES.html">rule-classes</a>, <span class="v">:meta</span> and <span class="v">:clause-processor</span>, other than fixing coding 
 bugs or making extra-logical changes such as output, you probably should read 
 these Essays.  Of course, before reading these or any essays, it is generally 
 a good idea to read relevant user-level documentation, such as the 
 documentation for <a href="ACL2____META.html">meta</a> or <a href="ACL2____CLAUSE-PROCESSOR.html">clause-processor</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A few other features of ACL2 with interesting logical foundations are
