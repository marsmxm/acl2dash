<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=IPASIR____WITH-LOCAL-IPASIR">Click for With-local-ipasir in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Create a local <a href="IPASIR____IPASIR.html">ipasir</a> solver object, initialize it, and 
properly release it when done.</p><p>The syntax of with-local-ipasir is similar to that of <a href="ACL2____WITH-LOCAL-STOBJ.html">with-local-stobj</a>, but the first argument (stobj name) is optional and defaults 
to <span class="v">ipasir</span>.  However, note that <span class="v">state</span> must be available and must be 
one of the objects returned by the inner <span class="v">mv-let</span> form; this is because 
<a href="IPASIR____IPASIR-INIT.html">ipasir-init</a> returns state.</p>
