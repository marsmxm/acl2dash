<p><span class="v">fast-alist-pop*</span> removes the first key-value pair from a fast 
alist, rebinding that key to its previous value in the backing hash table. 
That value must be provided as the prev-binding argument.</p><p>This is a user extension to the ACL2 (in particular, ACL2H) system. 
It may eventually be added to acl2h proper, but until then it requires a trust 
tag since it hasn't been thoroughly vetted for soundness.</p> 
 
<p>Logically, <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____FAST-ALIST-POP_A2.html">fast-alist-pop*</a> pair x)</span> is just <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x)</span>.  However, it 
has a special side-effect when called on a fast alist (see <a href="ACL2____HONS-ACONS.html">hons-acons</a>). 
A fast alist has a backing hash table mapping its keys to their 
corresponding (unshadowed) pairs, which supports constant-time alist lookup. 
<a href="ACL2____HONS-ACONS.html">Hons-acons</a> adds key/value pairs to the alist and its backing hash table, 
and <a href="ACL2____HONS-GET.html">hons-get</a> performs constant-time lookup by finding the backing hash 
table and looking up the key in the table.  However, logically, hons-get is 
just <a href="ACL2____HONS-ASSOC-EQUAL.html">hons-assoc-equal</a>, a more traditional alist lookup function that 
traverses the alist until it finds the matching key.  Correspondingly, 
fast-alist-pop* is logically just CDR, but it undoes the binding in the backing 
hash table represented by the CAR of the alist.  The guard requires that the 
<span class="v">prev-binding</span> argument is the shadowed binding of <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAAR.html">caar</a> x)</span> in the 
remainder of the alist, so to undo that binding in the backing hash table, we 
associate that key to the cdr of the <span class="v">prev-binding</span>.</p>
