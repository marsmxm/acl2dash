<p>Pages Written Especially for the Tours</p><p>The ACL2 Home Page is generated from ACL2's online documentation 
 strings. 
 (How else could we achieve the total integration of ACL2's online 
 documentation with the home page?)  This page is just an artifact of the 
 structure of our documentation strings: each string must belong to a ``major 
 section'' of the documentation database.  This page is not structured to be 
 used by a person browsing via the Web.  It contains, in an arbitrary order, 
 the pages written specifically for the Web user.</p> 
 
 <p>Furthermore, browsing the pages below as text, in particular using the 
 ACL2 :DOC command, is often unsatisfying because because of the lack of 
 support for displaying gif files or for going ``back'' to a node just visited. 
 If you wish to look at the pages below, we strongly recommend that you do so 
 via a HTML-based Web browser.  Indeed, you should simply visit ACL2's Home 
 Page and take one of the Tours.</p> 
 
 <p>Generally, the topics listed above will not be of use to the ACL2 
 user.</p>
