<p>Style Guidelines for Developing ACL2 System Code</p><p>Here we set out some style guidelines that have traditionally been 
 followed in the ACL2 sources.  They can guide development to help maintain 
 ACL2's quality by giving its source files a consistent look.</p> 
 
 <p>The right margin is 79.  (In Emacs: <span class="v">set-fill-column 79</span>.)  Existing 
 code with margin 70 is OK to leave as is, though it's nice to convert to a 
 margin of 79 when modifying comments within a given function.</p> 
 
 <p>Tabs are not used.  In Emacs, setting buffer-local variable 
 <span class="v">indent-tabs-mode</span> to <span class="v">nil</span> will accomplish this.  That can be 
 accomplished automatically for Lisp files, as is done in distributed file 
 <span class="v">emacs/emacs-acl2.el</span>; search there for <span class="v">indent-tabs-mode</span>, or simply 
 load that file in your <span class="v">.emacs</span> file.</p> 
 
 <p>Periods that end sentences are followed by two spaces (useful for the 
 <span class="v">meta-e</span> command in Emacs).</p> 
 
 <p>Comments for a function go immediately after its formal parameters 
 (even before <a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> forms).</p> 
 
 <p>Comments generally consist of complete sentences, starting on the left 
 margin, each line starting with a single semicolon followed by a space.  An 
 exception is very short comments to the right of code up to the end of the 
 same line.</p> 
 
 <p>Use of the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____COND.html">cond</a></span> macro is generally preferred to the use of <span class="v">if</span>, 
 an exception being small expressions that are not at the top level of the 
 <span class="v">if</span> structure.</p> 
 
 <p>System state globals need to be included in <span class="v">*initial-global-table*</span> or 
 <span class="v">*initial-ld-special-bindings*</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Blank lines are avoided except in the usual circumstances, e.g., 
 surrounding comments and between definitions.  Avoid consecutive blank 
 lines.</p> 
 
 <p>A multi-line argument is not followed by an argument on the same line.  For 
 example, there should be a linebreak before the argument, <span class="v">arg</span>, after the 
 string in this <span class="v">COND</span> clause:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(t (<a href="ACL2____ER.html">er</a> soft ctx
       "The value associated with a :SOME-NEW-HINT hint must be a positive ~
       integer, but ~x0 is not." arg))</pre> 
 
 <p>We generally avoid capitalizing all letters in a single word, except 
 perhaps for keywords or quoted constants.</p> 
 
 <p>There are no multi-line comments: <span class="v">#|| ... ||#</span>.</p>
