<p>Notion of definedness of functions, for some event macros.</p><p>As far as certain event macros are concerned, 
     an ACL2 named function is defined if and only if 
     it has a non-<span class="v">nil</span> unnormalized body. 
     This notion of definedness applies to the event macros 
     whose user documentation links to this XDOC topic 
     from the place where definedness is mentioned.</p><p>The unnormalized body of a named function is 
     the <span class="v">acl2::unnormalized-body</span> property of the function symbol. 
     The value of this property is 
     the <a href="ACL2____TERM.html">translated term</a> obtained 
     from the function body that appears (in untranslated form) 
     in the <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> event that introduces the function. 
     This is the case not only for user-defined functions, 
     but also for built-in defined ACL2 functions, 
     whose introducing <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a></span> events can be seen 
     via <a href="ACL2____PE.html"><span class="v">:pe</span></a>.</p><p>A valid untranslated term never translates to <span class="v">nil</span>. 
     The untranslated term <span class="v">nil</span> translates to <span class="v">'nil</span>, a quoted constant. 
     Valid variable symbols do not include <span class="v">nil</span>, 
     so <span class="v">nil</span> is not a valid translated variable term; 
     it satisfies <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____PSEUDO-TERMP.html">pseudo-termp</a></span> 
     (which captures a superset of the valid translated terms), 
     but it does not satisfy <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____TERMP.html">termp</a></span>. 
     Therefore, the unnormalized body of a defined function cannot be <span class="v">nil</span>: 
     testing the <span class="v">acl2::unnormalized-body</span> property against <span class="v">nil</span> 
     is therefore a good way to check 
     whether a function is defined in the event macros 
     that use this notion of definedness.</p><p>However, the built-in program-mode functions are defined 
     but do not have an unnormalized body. 
     Thus, the event macros that use this notion of definedness 
     would not regard these functions as being defined. 
     This is only an issue for program-mode functions, 
     not for logic-mode functions (including the built-in ones); 
     thus, if an event macro requires a function (e.g. to be transformed) 
     to be in logic mode and to be defined, 
     checking the unnormalized body is an accurate way 
     to establish if the logic-mode function is defined.</p><p>The system utility <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBODY.html">ubody</a></span> (or <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____UBODY_B2.html">ubody+</a></span>) 
     retrieves the unnormalized body of a function. 
     It is a specialization of the built-in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____BODY.html">body</a></span> system utility, 
     which retrieves the unnormalized or normalized body of a function. 
     based on the flag passed as argument. 
     The normalized body of a function may differ from the unnormalized one 
     because the former may be obtained from the latter 
     via some simplifications.</p>
