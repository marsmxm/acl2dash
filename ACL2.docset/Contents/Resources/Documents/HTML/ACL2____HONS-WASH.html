<p><span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____HONS-WASH.html">hons-wash</a>)</span> is like <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____GC_42.html">gc$</a></span> but can also garbage collect 
<a href="ACL2____NORMED.html">normed</a> objects (CCL and GCL Only).</p><p>Logically, <span class="v">hons-wash</span> just returns nil; we leave it enabled and 
 would think it odd to ever prove a theorem about it.</p> 
 
 <p>Under the hood, in CCL and GCL, <span class="v">hons-wash</span> runs a garbage collection 
 after taking special measures to allow normed conses to be collected.  In 
 Lisps other than CCL, <span class="v">hons-wash</span> does nothing.  This is because the 
 efficient implementation of <span class="v">hons-wash</span> is specific to the "static 
 honsing" scheme which requires CCL-specific features.</p> 
 
 <p>Why is this function needed?  Ordinarily, it is not possible to garbage 
 collect any normed conses.  This is because the Hons Space includes pointers 
 to any normed conses, and hence Lisp's garbage collector thinks these objects 
 are live.  To correct for this, <span class="v">hons-wash</span> (1) clears out these pointers, 
 (2) runs a garbage collection, then (3) re-norms any previously-normed conses 
 which have survived the garbage collection.</p> 
 
 <p>Notes.</p> 
 
 <ul> 
 
 <li>It is not recommended to interrupt this function.  Doing so may cause 
 persistently normed conses and fast alist keys to become un-normed, which 
 might lead to less efficient re-norming and/or violations of the fast-alist 
 discipline.</li> 
 
 <li>(For ACL2(p) users only; see <a href="ACL2____PARALLELISM.html">parallelism</a>) If parallel execution is 
 enabled (see <a href="ACL2____SET-PARALLEL-EXECUTION.html">set-parallel-execution</a>), as it is by default in ACL2(p), 
 then <span class="v">hons-wash</span> may be a no-op (other than to print a warning), in order 
 to avoid thread-unsafe behavior.  (However, In CCL you are unlikely to see 
 this restriction unless you are running more than one thread.)  To get around 
 this restriction, you can instead use <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____HONS-WASH_12.html">hons-wash!</a></span>, which however 
 requires a <a href="ACL2____TRUST-TAG.html">trust-tag</a>.</li>
