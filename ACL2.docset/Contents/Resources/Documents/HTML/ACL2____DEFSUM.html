<p>Define a recursive data type similar to a Haskell type definition.</p><p>Example:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> "tools/defsum" :dir :system)
(<a href="ACL2____SET-IGNORE-OK.html">set-ignore-ok</a> :warn)
(<a href="ACL2____DEFSUM.html">defsum</a> my-list
  (my-empty)
  (my-cons car (my-list-p cdr)))</pre> 
 
<p>This declaration says that an object is of the type <span class="v">my-list</span> if it 
is either of the type <span class="v">my-empty</span> or <span class="v">my-cons</span>, where <span class="v">my-empty</span> 
is an empty structure and <span class="v">my-cons</span> is a structure with two fields: 
the <span class="v">car</span>, an arbitrary object; and the <span class="v">cdr</span> which is of type 
<span class="v">my-list</span>.  In this case, recognizers <span class="v">my-list-p</span>, <span class="v">my-empty-p</span>, 
and <span class="v">my-cons-p</span> are defined along with constructors <span class="v">my-empty</span> and 
<span class="v">my-cons</span> and destructors <span class="v">my-cons-car</span> and <span class="v">my-cons-cdr</span>.  The 
necessary macros are also defined to enable pattern-matching using the 
constructors (see <a href="ACL2____PATTERN-MATCH.html">pattern-match</a>).  For mutually-recursive data types 
see <a href="ACL2____DEFSUMS.html">defsums</a>.  It may also be informative to look at the translated 
version of a defsum form using :trans1.</p> 
 
<p>Note that a defsum form produces several logic-mode events inside an 
encapsulate.  Despite the author's best intentions, not every such 
automatically-generated event will complete successfully.  If you 
encounter a defsum form that fails, please email it to 
sswords@cs.utexas.edu (with or without fixing the bug yourself.)</p> 
 
<p>Several theorems about the new type are defined so as to enable 
reasoning based on their abstract model rather than their underlying 
list representation. For most reasoning these theorems should be 
sufficient without enabling the function definitions or 
executable-counterparts.  In case these do need to be enabled, 
theories named (for the above example) <span class="v">my-list-functions</span> and 
<span class="v">my-list-executable-counterparts</span> are defined.</p> 
 
<p>In addition to the recognizer, constructor, and destructor functions, 
a measure function is also defined which counts the number of nested 
objects of the sum type.  In the example above, the measure function 
is my-list-measure and the measure of an object is 1 if it is not a 
my-cons, and 1 plus the measure of its my-cons-cdr if it is.</p> 
 
<p>Defsum accepts some keyword arguments.  Be aware that not all 
combinations of these arguments have been tested extensively.  Again, 
please send bug reports to sswords@cs.utexas.edu if you find a defsum 
form that does not succeed.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">:arithmetic</span> - By default, each <span class="v">defsum</span> event expands to an 
encapsulate which locally includes the book arithmetic/top-with-meta. 
If an incompatible arithmetic book has already been included, this may 
cause the defsum to fail.  But the other arithmetic book may also have 
theorems that allow the defsum event to succeed if we don't attempt to 
include the arithmetic book.  This can be done by setting 
<span class="v">:arithmetic nil</span>.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">:guard</span> - may be set to <span class="v">t</span>, <span class="v">nil</span>, or <span class="v">:fast</span>.  By default 
it is set to <span class="v">t</span>, in which case minimal guards are set for all 
functions.  If set to <span class="v">nil</span>, guards will not be verified for any 
functions; this is useful in case some field type recognizers don't 
have their guards verified.  If set to <span class="v">:fast</span>, an additional 
recognizer for each product is defined named ``foo-p-fast'' if the 
product is named foo.  This has a guard such that its argument must be 
a valid sum object.  It is then logically equivalent to the other 
recognizer, but in execution only checks that the symbol in the car of 
the object matches the name of the product.  The pattern matcher for 
each product then uses the fast recognizers.  Thus fast guards result 
in a small (?) gain in performance in exchange for a (hopefully 
trivial) degradation in logical complexity.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">:short-accessors</span> - <span class="v">t</span> by default; may be set to <span class="v">nil</span>.  If 
<span class="v">t</span>, each field accessor first checks whether the object is of the 
correct product type and returns nil if not.  This allows for an 
additional theorem saying that if x is not of the correct product 
type, then the accessor returns nil.  If <span class="v">nil</span>, the nth accessor 
returns <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NTH.html">nth</a> n x)</span> regardless of x's type.  When guards are turned 
on, this is implemented with an <span class="v">mbe</span> so there should be no 
performance difference between the two options.  When guards are off, 
performance will be somewhat better if this feature is turned off.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">:compact</span> - By default, a defsum constructor makes a product 
object by putting its components into a cons tree using n-1 conses, 
but a prettier list representation is also supported which uses n 
conses to store the elements in a flattened list which is easier to 
read when printed.  Set <span class="v">:compact nil</span> if you prefer this 
representation.</p> 
 
<p><span class="v">:hons</span> - If HONS mode is in use, the flag <span class="v">:hons t</span> causes all 
defsum forms to be built with HONSes rather than regular conses.  See 
<a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>.</p> 
 
<p>It may be necessary to include some function definition in a mutual 
recursion with the sum recognizer function.  In this case simply put 
the defun form inside the defsum form, i.e.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFSUM.html">defsum</a> lisp-term
  (lisp-atom val)
  (func-app (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> function) (lisp-term-listp args))
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> lisp-term-listp (<a href="ACL2____ARGS.html">args</a>)
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____DECLARE.html">declare</a> (<a href="ACL2____XARGS.html">xargs</a> :guard t))
    (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____ATOM.html">atom</a> args)
        (<a href="COMMON-LISP____NULL.html">null</a> args)
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____AND.html">and</a> (lisp-term-p (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CAR.html">car</a> args))
           (lisp-term-listp (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> args))))))</pre> 
 
<p>If such a function is included, however, no measure function will be 
defined for the sum.</p> 
 
<p>Usually it is not necessary to specify a measure for such a function; 
because there is currently no way of directly specifying the measure 
for the sum's recognizer, specifying an exotic measure on such a 
function is likely to fail.  If you come up against this limitation, 
please send an example to sswords@cs.utexas.edu.</p>
