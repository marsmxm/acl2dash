<h3><a href="../index.html?topic=ACL2____DEF-WITNESS-RULESET">Click for Def-witness-ruleset in the Full Manual</a></h3>

<p>Name a set of <a href="ACL2____WITNESS-CP.html">witness-cp</a> rules.</p><p>The <a href="ACL2____WITNESS.html">witness</a> computed-hint macro takes a <span class="v">:ruleset</span> 
argument that determines which witness-cp rules are allowed to fire. 
<span class="v">def-witness-ruleset</span> allows one name to abbreviate several actual rules in 
this context.</p> 
 
<p>Usage:</p> 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEF-WITNESS-RULESET.html">def-witness-ruleset</a> foo-rules
  '(foo-instancing
    foo-witnessing
    bar-example-for-foo
    baz-example-for-foo))</pre> 
 
<p>After submitting this form, the following invocations of WITNESS are 
equivalent:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____WITNESS.html">witness</a> :ruleset foo-rules)
(<a href="ACL2____WITNESS.html">witness</a> :ruleset (foo-rules))
(<a href="ACL2____WITNESS.html">witness</a> :ruleset (foo-instancing
                   foo-witnessing
                   bar-example-for-foo
                   baz-example-for-foo))</pre> 
 
<p>These rulesets are defined using a table event.  If multiple different 
definitions are given for the same ruleset name, the latest one is always in 
effect.</p> 
 
<p>Rulesets can contain other rulesets.  These are expanded at the time the 
<a href="ACL2____WITNESS.html">witness</a> hint is run.  A ruleset can be expanded with</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(witness-expand-ruleset names (<a href="ACL2____W.html">w</a> state))</pre> 
 
<p>Witness rules can also be enabled/disabled using <a href="ACL2____WITNESS-ENABLE.html">witness-enable</a> and 
<a href="ACL2____WITNESS-DISABLE.html">witness-disable</a>; these settings take effect when WITNESS is called 
without specifying a ruleset.  Ruleset names may be used in witness-enable and 
witness-disable just as they are used in the ruleset argument of WITNESS.</p>
