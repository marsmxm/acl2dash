<p>An interactive tool for controlling ACL2's proof processes.</p><p>Call this up with <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">verify</a> ...)</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>The <i>interactive proof-builder</i> provides a way to explore the 
 development of ACL2 proofs below the level of the ACL2 prover (as typically 
 used by <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____THM.html">thm</a></span> and <a href="ACL2____EVENTS.html">events</a> such as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span>).  To use this 
 tool, invoke the <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">verify</a></span> command, for example as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">verify</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x y) z)
                      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> x (<a href="COMMON-LISP____APPEND.html">append</a> y z))))
-&gt;:</pre> 
 
 <p>Then at the <span class="v">"-&gt;:"</span> prompt, one submits commands that operate on a 
 stack of goals, starting with the single goal that was supplied to <span class="v">VERIFY</span> 
 as shown above.  The final command (or ``instruction'') can be an <span class="v">exit</span> 
 command, which can print out a <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a></span> event if the goal stack is 
 empty; see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER-COMMANDS.html">proof-builder-commands</a>, in particular the <span class="v">exit</span> command. 
 That resulting <span class="v">defthm</span> event includes an <span class="v">:</span><span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a></span> 
 parameter, which directs replay of the interactive proof-builder commands (for 
 example during certification of a book containing that event; see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">books</a>).</p> 
 
 <p>If you exit the interactive proof-builder's loop, you may re-enter that 
 session at the same point using the command <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____VERIFY.html">verify</a>)</span>, i.e., with no 
 arguments.  The commands <span class="v">save</span> and <span class="v">retrieve</span> may be invoked to manage 
 more than one session.</p> 
 
 <p>The interactive proof-builder can be invoked on a specific subgoal, and the 
 resulting <span class="v">:instructions</span> can be given as a hint to the theorem prover for 
 that subgoal.  See <a href="ACL2____INSTRUCTIONS.html">instructions</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>A tutorial is available <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/tutorial/rev3.html" target="_blank"><nobr>here<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/tutorial/rev3.html"></nobr></a>. 
 That tutorial illustrates more than just the interactive proof-builder.  The 
 portion relevant to the proof-builder may be accessed directly <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/tutorial/rev3.html#slide29" target="_blank"><nobr>here<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/kaufmann/tutorial/rev3.html#slide29"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
 <p>See <a href="ACL2____SET-EVISC-TUPLE.html">set-evisc-tuple</a> for how to arrange that output is printed in 
 abbreviated form.  In general, the interactive proof-builder uses the 
 <span class="v">:TERM</span> <a href="ACL2____EVISC-TUPLE.html">evisc-tuple</a> described in that documentation.</p> 
 
 <p>Individual proof-builder commands are documented in subsection <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER-COMMANDS.html">proof-builder-commands</a>.  For a list of perhaps the most commonly used 
 commands, see <a href="ACL2____PROOF-BUILDER-COMMANDS-SHORT-LIST.html">proof-builder-commands-short-list</a>.</p> 
 
 <p>The proof-builder supports user-defined macros, which are tactics that 
 generate proof-builder instructions.  See <a href="ACL2____DEFINE-PC-MACRO.html">define-pc-macro</a>.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Remark.</i>  The ``pc-'' prefix, for example in ``define-pc-macro'' 
 above, stems from an earlier name for the proof-builder, which was 
 ``proof-checker''.  That also accounts for the string <span class="v">"PC"</span> in the 
 package name, <span class="v">"ACL2-PC"</span>.</p>
