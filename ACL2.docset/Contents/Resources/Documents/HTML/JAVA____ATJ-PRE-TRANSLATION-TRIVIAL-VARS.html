<p>Pre-translation step performed by ATJ: 
          removal of all the trivial lambda-bound variables.</p><p>This is done only in the shallow embedding.</p><p>We remove all the lambda-bound variables, 
     and corresponding actual arguments, 
     that are identical to the corresponding actual arguments. 
     See the discussion in <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____REMOVE-TRIVIAL-VARS.html">remove-trivial-vars</a></span>, 
     which is the utility that we use 
     to accomplish this pre-translation step.</p><p>This pre-translation step makes terms simpler to work with 
     (for the purpose of ATJ) 
     by only keeping the ``true'' <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span>s in a term 
     (which are lambda expressions in translated terms), 
     avoiding the ``artificial'' ones to close the lambda expressions. 
     Indeed, <span class="tt"><a href="COMMON-LISP____LET.html">let</a></span> terms are generally not closed in other languages, 
     or even in ACL2's untranslated terms.</p>
