<p>Further information on expanding definitions via rewriting</p><p>We assume you've read about ``<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED-INSTANCE.html">instances</a>'' and picked up 
 our basic terminology including the ideas of <i>matching</i> a <i>pattern</i> 
 term to a <i>target</i> term, obtaining a <i>substitution</i> and how to 
 <i>instantiate</i> a term with a substitution.  We use these notions below 
 without further citation.</p> 
 
 <p>In addition, we assume you've read about ``<a href="ACL2____LOGIC-KNOWLEDGE-TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED-REWRITING.html">rewriting</a>'' where we 
 introduced the idea of treating a theorem (axiom, definition, or lemma) as a 
 <i>conditional rewrite</i> rule and replaced one term by an equivalent one 
 provided we can <i>relieve the hypotheses</i>.</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose you're trying to prove <i>formula1</i> and you transform it to 
 <i>formula2</i> by rewriting.  What happened?</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>formula1</i>: 
(implies (and (not (consp z)) 
              (true-listp z)) 
         (equal (rev (rev z)) z)) 
 
<i>formula2</i>: 
(implies (and (not (consp z)) 
              (equal z nil)) 
         (equal (rev (rev z)) z)) 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Evidently we replaced <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> z)</span> by <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> z nil)</span>.  But how 
 did that happen?  What really happened was the sequential application of 
 several unconditional rewrites and the use of replacement of equals by 
 equals.</p> 
 
 <p>The definition of <span class="v">true-listp</span> is:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____DEFUN.html">defun</a> true-listp (x)
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> x)
      (<a href="ACL2____TRUE-LISTP.html">true-listp</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CDR.html">cdr</a> x))
      (<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> x nil))).</pre> 
 
 <p>By rewriting once with the definition of <span class="v">true-listp</span>, we transform 
 <i>formula1</i> to:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>formula1'</i>: 
(implies (and (not (consp z)) 
              (if (consp z) 
                  (true-listp (cdr z)) 
                  (equal z nil))) 
         (equal (rev (rev z)) z)). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Note how the call of <span class="v">true-listp</span> has been replaced by the entire body 
 of <span class="v">true-listp</span>.</p> 
 
 <p>Next, note that the first hypothesis above is that <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> z)</span> is false. 
 That is, <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NOT.html">not</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> z))</span> is the same as <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> z) nil)</span>. 
 Thus, replacement of equals by equals means we can transform <i>formula1'</i> 
 to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>formula1''</i>: 
(implies (and (not (consp z)) 
              (if nil 
                  (true-listp (cdr z)) 
                  (equal z nil))) 
         (equal (rev (rev z)) z)). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>(We will explore replacement of equals by equals later.)</p> 
 
 <p>Furthermore, we know the basic axiom about <span class="v">if</span>:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>Axiom</i> if-nil: 
(if nil x y) = y. 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Rewriting with this particular axiom, using <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____IF.html">if</a> nil x y)</span> as the 
 pattern and <span class="v">y</span> as the replacement, will transform <i>formula1''</i> to</p> 
 
 <pre class="code"><i>formula2</i>: 
(implies (and (not (consp z)) 
              (equal z nil)) 
         (equal (rev (rev z)) z)). 
</pre> 
 
 <p>Often when we say we derived one formula from another by ``expansion'' and 
 or by ``rewriting'' we take many rewrite steps, as here.  We typically use 
 hypotheses of the formula without noting ``replacement of equals by equals'' 
 as when we replaced <span class="v">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____CONSP.html">consp</a> z)</span> by <span class="v">nil</span>, and we typically omit to 
 mention the use of basic axioms like <span class="v">if-nil</span> above.</p>
