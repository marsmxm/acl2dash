<p>Compile some ACL2 functions leaving .c and .h files</p><p><span class="v">Comp-gcl</span> is for use by experts who want to examine the results 
 of GCL compilation, and it may only be used with ACL2 implementations built on 
 top of GCL.  It takes exactly the same arguments as <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a></span>, and has the 
 same basic functionality (see <a href="ACL2____COMP.html">comp</a>), but has two additional effects. 
 First, files <span class="v">"TMP.lisp"</span> and <span class="v">"TMP1.lisp"</span> are always created, even 
 when a single function is specified.  Second, <span class="v">comp-gcl</span> always leaves 
 files <span class="v">"TMP.c"</span>, <span class="v">"TMP.h"</span>, <span class="v">"TMP1.c"</span>, and <span class="v">"TMP1.h"</span> 
 when compilation is complete.</p>
