<p>Case macro for the different kinds of <a href="C____MEMBER-TYPE-LIST-OPTION.html">member-type-list-option</a> structures.</p><p>This is an <a href="ACL2____FTY.html">ACL2::fty</a> sum-type case macro, 
typically introduced by <a href="FTY____DEFFLEXSUM.html">fty::defflexsum</a> or <a href="FTY____DEFTAGSUM.html">fty::deftagsum</a>.  It 
allows you to safely check the type of a <a href="C____MEMBER-TYPE-LIST-OPTION.html">member-type-list-option</a> structure, or to split 
into cases based on its type.</p> 
 
<h3>Short Form</h3> 
 
<p>In its short form, <span class="v">member-type-list-option-case</span> allows you to safely check the type of 
a <span class="v">member-type-list-option</span> structure.  For example:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="C____MEMBER-TYPE-LIST-OPTION-CASE.html">member-type-list-option-case</a> x :some)</pre> 
<p>is essentially just a safer alternative to writing:</p> 
              <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____EQUAL.html">equal</a> (<a href="C____MEMBER-TYPE-LIST-OPTION-KIND.html">member-type-list-option-kind</a> x) :some)</pre> 
 
              <p>Why is using member-type-list-option-case safer?  When we directly inspect the 
              kind with <span class="v">equal</span>, there is no static checking being done to 
              ensure that, e.g., <span class="v">:some</span> is a valid kind of <a href="C____MEMBER-TYPE-LIST-OPTION.html">member-type-list-option</a> structure.  That means there is nothing to save you 
              if, later, you change the kind keyword for this type from <span class="v">:some</span> to something else.  It also means you get no help 
              if you just make a typo when writing the <span class="v">:some</span> 
              symbol.  Over the course of developing VL, we found that such 
              issues were very frequent sources of errors!</p><h3>Long Form</h3> 
 
<p>In its longer form, <span class="v">member-type-list-option-case</span> allows you to split into cases based 
on the kind of structure you are looking at.  A typical example would be:</p> 
 
<pre class="code">(<a href="C____MEMBER-TYPE-LIST-OPTION-CASE.html">member-type-list-option-case</a> x
  :some ...
  :none ...)</pre> 
 
<p>It is also possible to consolidate ``uninteresting'' cases using 
<span class="v">:otherwise</span>.</p> 
 
<p>For convenience, the case macro automatically binds the fields of <span class="v">x</span> for 
you, as appropriate for each case.  That is, in the <span class="v">:some</span> case, 
you can use <a href="FTY____DEFPROD.html">fty::defprod</a>-style <span class="v">foo.bar</span> style accessors for <span class="v">x</span> 
without having to explicitly add a <span class="v">some</span> <a href="ACL2____B_A2.html">b*</a> 
binder.</p>
