<p>Prove basic properties about a matching function.</p><p>The macro <span class="v">def-match-thms</span> can be used to prove some basic 
theorems about a new matching function.</p> 
 
<p>Note: typically, you should only want to use this macro if you are defining 
a new matching function.  If you are just using existing matching functions 
like <a href="CLEX____SIN-MATCH-LIT.html">sin-match-lit</a> to write your own lexer, this isn't what you 
want.</p> 
 
<p>Form: <span class="tt">(def-match-thms name)</span></p> 
 
<p>This expands into a <a href="ACL2____MAKE-EVENT.html">make-event</a>.  The <span class="v">name</span> you give should be the 
name of some newly defined matching function.  We look up the signature of 
<span class="v">name</span> from the world and try to prove the matching function satisfies the 
following properties.</p> 
 
<p><b>Well-Typed.</b> The match is either a non-empty string or nil.  Note that 
there is generally no reason to prove anything about the well-formedness of 
<span class="v">sin</span>, itself.</p> 
 
<p><b>Progress.</b> The length of the input stream's contents never increases, 
and always decreases when text is matched.</p> 
 
<p><b>Reconstruction.</b> Appending the matched text onto the new input 
stream's contents yields the original input stream's contents.  In other words, 
the matcher properly matches text from the front of the stream.</p> 
 
<p><b>Graceful Failure.</b> If there is no match, the stream is 
unchanged.</p> 
 
<p><b>Match-Free Failure.</b> (weak matchers only) If the weak matcher 
fails (i.e., it signals that <span class="v">okp</span> is <span class="v">nil</span>), then the <span class="v">match</span> it 
returns is also <span class="v">nil</span>.</p>
