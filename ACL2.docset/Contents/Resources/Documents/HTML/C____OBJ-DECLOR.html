<p>These are declarators for objects. 
     [C] does not have a separate syntactic category for them, 
     but in our abstract syntax for now 
     we differentiate them from other kinds of declarators.</p><p>For now we only capture three kinds of object declarators: 
     (i) a direct declarator consisting of a single identifier; 
     (ii) a pointer declarator consisting of 
     the pointer notation <span class="v">*</span> 
     and (recursively) an object declarator; and 
     (iii) an array (direct) declarator consisting of 
     an object declarator (recursively) 
     and the array notation <span class="v">[]</span> with 
     either nothing in it (i.e. unspecified size) 
     or an integer constant in it (i.e. specified size). 
     Using an integer constant as size is less general than [C] allows, 
     but it suffices for now.</p><p>Note that we can represent sequences of pointer notations <span class="v">* ... *</span> 
     by nesting the <span class="v">:pointer</span> constructor. 
     Note also that a direct declarator may be a (parenthesized) declarator, 
     but in our abstract syntax we just have declarators, 
     which we can nest under the <span class="v">:array</span> constructor, 
     so we do not need to represent parentheses explicitly.</p>
