<p>An executable mapping from 
          the concrete syntax of ABNF to the abstract syntax of ABNF.</p><p>The ABNF abstract syntax is an abstraction of the concrete syntax. 
     That is, there is a mapping 
     from the parse trees obtained by parsing sequences of natural numbers 
     according to the rules of the concrete syntax of ABNF, 
     to the entities of the abstract syntax of ABNF. 
     The mapping abstracts away many of the details of the concrete syntax.</p><p>This abstraction mapping is defined by a collection of functions. 
     These functions explicitly check that the trees 
     satisfy certain expected conditions. 
     Eventually, these expected conditions 
     should be proved to follow from suitable guards.</p>
