<p>(Unsound transform) Replace instances annotated with LINT_IGNORE_INST, 
          with an instance intended not to generate uninteresting lint 
          warnings.</p><p>The annotated instances are kept, but changed to reference a new 
module.  The new module is a rewrite of the original instantiated module, which 
may still be used elsewhere.  The new module's name is mangled to make it 
unique and its ports are kept the same while its contents are changed so that 
it trivially uses all inputs and sets all outputs.</p> 
 
<p>This transform is done after elaboration so that we don't have to worry 
about different versions of parameterized modules.</p> 
 
<p>Note: currently missing support for interface ports.</p>
