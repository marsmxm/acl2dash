<p>Tool for detecting unused and unset wires.</p><p><b>USE-SET</b> is a simple tool for detecting wires which may be 
unset or unused.  This is a primitive, static analysis that can be carried out 
on the Verilog source tree.</p> 
 
<p><b>Unset</b> wires are those which have no values flowing into them. An 
unset wire should satisfy the following properties:</p> 
 
<ol> 
 <li>No "assign" statement is assigning a value to it, and</li> 
 <li>It is not in any submodule's output ("driven from below")</li> 
 <li>It is not a primary input ("driven from above")</li> 
</ol> 
 
<p><b>Unused</b> wires are those whose values are not sent anywhere. An unused 
wire should satisfy the following properties:</p> 
 
<ol> 
 <li>It is not in the RHS of any assignment</li> 
 <li>It is not in any submodule's input ("possibly used below")</li> 
 <li>It is not a primary output ("possibly used above")</li> 
</ol> 
 
<h3>Limitations</h3> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>USE-SET does not currently look at always or initial statements. If wires 
are only used or set in these statements, they may not be reported 
correctly.</li> 
 
<li>USE-SET is not at all clever: it will not realize that <span class="v">bar</span> is unused 
in code such as <span class="v">assign foo = 1'b0 &amp; bar;</span> or <span class="v">assign foo = {0
{bar}};</span>
</li> 
 
<li>USE-SET does not know about the C code that implements RAM modules in 
speedsim, etc., and will think that such wires are unset.</li> 
 
<li>USE-SET does not consider the individual bits of a vector. For instance, if 
you just write: 
 
<pre class="code">wire [7:0] foo;
assign foo[0] = 1'b0;</pre> 
 
It treats the entire wire <span class="v">foo</span> as set, even though <span class="v">foo[0]</span> is the only 
bit that has really been set.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<h3>Implementation</h3> 
 
<p>To carry out the analysis, our high-level approach is as follows.  For each 
module, we construct a fast alist that associates each wire with a VL-WIREINFO 
object.  This info object includes boolean flags that indicate whether the 
wire has been used or set.  Then, we simply walk over this alist to print out 
any wires which are either unused or unset.  We imagine that we may eventually 
want to add additional kinds of information here.</p>
