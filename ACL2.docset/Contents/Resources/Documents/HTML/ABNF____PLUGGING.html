<p>Composition of ABNF grammars.</p><p>Certain ABNF grammars are defined modularly. 
     A ``module'' may not be <a href="ABNF____CLOSURE.html">closed</a>, but when it is combined with other modules, 
     the resulting grammar may be closed.</p><p>For example, the <a href="ABNF____CONCRETE-SYNTAX-RULES.html">concrete syntax rules</a> are not closed. 
     But when they are combined with the <a href="ABNF____CORE-RULES.html">core rules</a>, the <a href="ABNF_____A2ALL-CONCRETE-SYNTAX-RULES_A2.html">resulting rule list</a> is closed.</p><p>As another example, 
     the HTTP grammar specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7230" target="_blank"><nobr>RFC 7230<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7230"></nobr></a> includes rules defined by prose value notations 
     that refer to the URI grammar specified in <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3986" target="_blank"><nobr>RFC 3968<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc3986"></nobr></a>. The intended way to compose the two grammars is 
     to replace the prose HTTP rules with the corresponding URI rules.</p><p>Here we define an operation to accomplish the kind of composition 
    exemplified above. 
    The operation ``plugs'' a rule list into another rule list, 
    e.g. it plugs the core rules into the concrete syntax rules, 
    and it plugs the URI rules into the HTTP rules.</p>
