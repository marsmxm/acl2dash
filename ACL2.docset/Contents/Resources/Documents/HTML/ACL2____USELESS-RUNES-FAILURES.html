<p>Failures caused by <a href="ACL2____USELESS-RUNES.html">useless-runes</a></p><p>When an event fails you may see the following message:</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">*NOTE*: Useless-runes may have taken part in failed proofs.  See :DOC
useless-runes-failures.</pre> 
 
 <p>This message is printed as part of any <a href="ACL2____EVENT.html">event</a> <a href="ACL2____FAILURE.html">failure</a> message 
 when a <a href="ACL2____USELESS-RUNES.html">useless-runes</a> file is being consulted, which is the default when 
 using build system tools (see <a href="ACL2____BOOKS-CERTIFICATION.html">books-certification</a> and <a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a>).  It is intended to suggest that you consider removing or 
 regenerating the associated <a href="ACL2____USELESS-RUNES.html">useless-runes</a> file in the situation 
 described below.</p> 
 
 <p>(Remark.  We hope that this message reduces confusion when a proof fails. 
 But if the event failure isn't from a failed proof attempt, please disregard 
 the <span class="v">*NOTE*</span> above and this documentation!)</p> 
 
 <p>Suppose that you have developed a book — say, <span class="v">foo.lisp</span> — 
 and placed it into the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a>.  Then <a href="ACL2____REGRESSION.html">regression</a> runs 
 may occasionally generate (or regenerate) the associated <a href="ACL2____USELESS-RUNES.html">useless-runes</a> 
 file.  Now suppose you modify <span class="v">foo.lisp</span> or some books that are included in 
 it.  You successfully run <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> "foo")</span>; yet, certification of 
 <span class="v">foo.lisp</span> subsequently fails as part of a <a href="ACL2____REGRESSION.html">regression</a> run or when you 
 use <span class="tt"><a href="BUILD____CERT.PL.html">build::cert.pl</a></span> to certify <span class="v">foo.lisp</span>.  This could be 
 unsettling!</p> 
 
 <p>In that case, what is probably happening is that the <a href="ACL2____USELESS-RUNES.html">useless-runes</a> 
 file is no longer suitable.  You could simply remove it from the GitHub 
 repository as follows (followed by the usual actions to update the 
 repository).</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">git rm .sys/foo@useless-runes.lsp</pre> 
 
 <p>Or, if you like, you could regenerate the useless-runes file, for example 
 as follows.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a> "foo" ? t :useless-runes :write)</pre> 
 
 
 <p>Or if you prefer to avoid this useless-runes file from now on, you could 
 add a line like the following to <span class="v">foo.acl2</span> (see <a href="BUILD____CUSTOM-CERTIFY-BOOK-COMMANDS.html">build::custom-certify-book-commands</a>) and also, ideally, delete the 
 useless-runes file using the <span class="v">"git rm"</span> command displayed above.</p>
