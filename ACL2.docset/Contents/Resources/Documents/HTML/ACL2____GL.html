<p>A symbolic simulation framework for proving finitely bounded ACL2 
theorems by bit-blasting with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram" target="_blank"><nobr>Binary Decision 
Diagram<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_decision_diagram"></nobr></a> (BDD) package or a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem" target="_blank"><nobr>SAT 
solver<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem"></nobr></a>.</p><h3>Overview</h3> 
 
<p>GL is a convenient and efficient tool for solving many finite ACL2 theorems 
that arise in <a href="ACL2____HARDWARE-VERIFICATION.html">hardware-verification</a> and other contexts.  It plays 
an important role in the verification of arithmetic units and microcode 
routines at <a href="http://www.centtech.com/" target="_blank"><nobr>Centaur Technology<img src="../Icon_External_Link.png" title="External link to http://www.centtech.com/"></nobr></a>.</p> 
 
<p>GL makes extensive use of <a href="ACL2____HONS-AND-MEMOIZATION.html">hons-and-memoization</a>.  Some 
optional parts of GL also require <a href="ACL2____DEFTTAG.html">trust 
tags</a>.</p> 
 
<p>GL translates ACL2 problems into Boolean problems that can be solved by 
automatic <a href="ACL2____BOOLEAN-REASONING.html">boolean-reasoning</a> tools.  When this approach can be 
used, there are some good reasons to prefer it over <a href="ACL2____THE-METHOD.html">the-method</a> of 
traditional, interactive theorem proving.  For instance, it can:</p> 
 
<ul> 
 
<li>Reduce the level of human understanding needed in the initial process of 
developing the proof;</li> 
 
<li>Provide clear counterexamples, whereas failed ACL2 proofs can often be 
difficult to debug; and</li> 
 
<li>Ease the maintenance of the proof, since after the design changes they can 
often find updated proofs without help.</li> 
 
</ul> 
 
<p>How does this translation work?  You can probably imagine writing a 
bit-based encoding of ACL2 objects.  For instance, you might represent an 
integer with some structure that contains a 2's-complement list of bits.  GL 
uses an encoding like this, except that Boolean expressions take the place of 
the bits.  We call these structures <a href="GL____SYMBOLIC-OBJECTS.html">symbolic-objects</a>.</p> 
 
<p>GL provides a way to effectively compute with symbolic objects; e.g., it can 
"add" two integers whose bits are expressions, producing a new symbolic 
object that represents their sum.  GL can perform similar computations for most 
ACL2 primitives.  Building on this capability, it can <b>symbolically 
execute</b> terms. The result of a symbolic execution is a new symbolic object 
that captures all the possible values the result could take.</p> 
 
<p>Symbolic execution can be used as a <b>proof procedure</b>.  To prove a 
theorem, we first symbolically execute its goal formula, then show the 
resulting symbolic object cannot represent <span class="v">nil</span>.  GL provides a <a href="ACL2____DEF-GL-THM.html">def-gl-thm</a> command that makes it easy to prove theorems with this approach. 
It handles all the details of working with symbolic objects, and only needs to 
be told how to represent the variables in the formula.</p> 
 
<h3>GL Documentation</h3> 
 
<div class="box"><p><b>New users</b> should begin with the <a href="GL____BASIC-TUTORIAL.html">basic-tutorial</a>, which walks 
through the basic ideas behind how GL works, and includes some examples that 
cover how to use GL.</p></div> 
 
<p>Once you start to use GL, you will likely be interested in the <a href="GL____REFERENCE.html">reference</a> section of this documentation.</p> 
 
<p>Like any automatic procedure, GL has a certain capacity.  But when these 
limits are reached, you may be able to work around the problem in various ways. 
The <a href="GL____OPTIMIZATION.html">optimization</a> section explains various ways to improve GL's 
performance.</p> 
 
<p>Occasionally GL proofs will fail due to resource limitations or limitations 
of its symbolic evaluation strategy.  When you run into problems, you may be 
interested in some tools and techniques for <a href="GL____DEBUGGING.html">debugging</a> failed proofs.</p> 
 
<p>If you want to go further with GL, you will probably want to explore <a href="GL____OTHER-RESOURCES.html">other-resources</a> beyond just this documentation, which include Sol Swords' 
Ph.D. dissertation, as well as many other academic papers and talks.</p>
