<p>Rules for executing constants.</p><p>To symbolically execute a constant, 
     we simply expand the definitions of a number of functions, 
     starting with <span class="tt"><a href="C____EXEC-CONST.html">exec-const</a></span> 
     and including all the functions called by it (directly or indirectly) 
     except for the fixtype constructors of the integer values 
     (i.e. <span class="tt"><a href="C____SINT.html">sint</a></span> etc.). 
     The argument of <span class="tt"><a href="C____EXEC-CONST.html">exec-const</a></span> is a quoted constant 
     during symbolic execution, 
     because it is taken from the ASTs being executed; 
     thus, for certain functions we only need to enable 
     the executable counterpart.</p>
