<p>An executable lexer of Yul.</p><p>This is a simple lexer for the Yul lexical grammar.  The grammar is defined in ABNF. 
     See <a href="YUL____GRAMMAR-NEW.html">grammar-new</a>.</p><p>The primary API for lexing Yul is <a href="YUL____LEXEMEIZE-YUL.html">lexemeize-yul</a> and <a href="YUL____LEXEMEIZE-YUL-BYTES.html">lexemeize-yul-bytes</a>.</p><p>The lexer is defined in three sections:</p><ol>
<li>Named pieces of <a href="ABNF____ABSTRACT-SYNTAX.html">ABNF abstract syntax</a> that occur internally to Yul grammar rules.</li>
<li>Parser generator control constants (see <a href="ABNF____PARSER-GENERATORS.html">parser-generators</a>) that are used to help generate the lexing functions:<ul>
<li>a constant containing the ABNF abstract syntax form of the lexical grammar</li>
<li>a constant containing the prefix that is attached to an ABNF rule name to generate its lexing function name</li>
<li>three constants (for groups, options, and repetitions) that map the abstract syntax structures in section 1 to names of the lexing functions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Definitions of lexing functions, most of which are just calls to macros that generate the functions, but some of which are hand-written due to limitations in the current parser generators.</li>
</ol>
