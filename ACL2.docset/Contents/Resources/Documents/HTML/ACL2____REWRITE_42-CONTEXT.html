<p>Rewrite a list of contextual assumptions</p><p>See <a href="ACL2____REWRITE_42.html">rewrite$</a> for relevant background.  The macro 
 <span class="v">rewrite$-context</span> is similar to <a href="ACL2____REWRITE_42-HYPS.html">rewrite$-hyps</a>, but it takes a 
 <span class="v">rewrite$-record</span> (``<span class="v">rrec</span>'') as an input to provide any <a href="ACL2____FORWARD-CHAINING.html">forward-chaining</a> and <a href="ACL2____LINEAR-ARITHMETIC.html">linear-arithmetic</a> assumptions.</p> 
 
 <p>Additional documentation may be provided here if requested by someone who 
 is considering use of this utility.  As of its initial introduction, it is not 
 used in any of the <a href="ACL2____COMMUNITY-BOOKS.html">community-books</a></p>
