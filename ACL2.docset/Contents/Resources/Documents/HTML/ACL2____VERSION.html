<p>ACL2 Version Number</p><p>To determine the version number of your copy of ACL2, evaluate the 
 form <span class="v">(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> acl2-version)</span>.  The value will be a string.  For example,</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">ACL2 !&gt;(<a href="ACL2_____04.html">@</a> acl2-version)
"ACL2 Version 3.4"</pre> 
 
 <p>The part of the string after <span class="v">"ACL2 Version "</span> is of the form <span class="v">x.y</span> 
 or <span class="v">x.y.z</span>, optionally followed by a succession of values in parentheses, 
 where <span class="v">x</span>, <span class="v">y</span>, and <span class="v">z</span> are natural numbers.  If <span class="v">z</span> is omitted 
 then it is implicitly 0.  We refer to <span class="v">X</span>, <span class="v">y</span>, and <span class="v">z</span> as the 
 ``major'', ``minor'', and ``incrl'' fields, respectively.  The incrl field is 
 used for incremental releases.  The discussion just below assumes that 
 incremental releases are not employed at the user's site, i.e., the incrl 
 fields are always 0.  We remove this assumption when we discuss incremental 
 releases at the end of this documentation topic.</p> 
 
 <p><a href="ACL2____BOOKS.html">Books</a> are considered certified only in the same version of ACL2 in 
 which the certification was done.  The <a href="ACL2____CERTIFICATE.html">certificate</a> file records the 
 version number of the certifying ACL2 and <a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a> considers the 
 book uncertified if that does not match the current version number.  Thus, 
 each time we release a new version of ACL2, previously certified books should 
 be recertified.</p> 
 
 <p>Note that there are over 150 constants in the system, most having to do 
 with the fact that ACL2 is coded in ACL2.  Many of these, for example 
 <span class="v">*common-lisp-specials-and-constants*</span> and <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span>, may change 
 from version to version, and this can cause unsoundness.  For example, the 
 symbol <span class="v">'set-difference-eq</span> was added to <span class="v">*acl2-exports*</span> in 
 Version_2.9, so we can certify a book in Version_2.8 containing the following 
 theorem, which is false in Version_2.9.</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="COMMON-LISP____NULL.html">null</a> (<a href="COMMON-LISP____MEMBER.html">member</a> 'set-difference-eq *acl2-exports*))</pre> 
 
 <p>Therefore, we need to disallow inclusion of such a book in a Version_2.9 
 session, which otherwise would allow us to prove <span class="v">nil</span>.  Furthermore, it is 
 possible that from one version of the system to another we might change, say, 
 the default values on some system function or otherwise make ``intentional'' 
 changes to the axioms.  It is even possible one version of the system is 
 discovered to be unsound and we release a new version to correct our 
 error.</p> 
 
 <p>Therefore we adopted the draconian policy that books are certified by a 
 given version of ACL2 and ``must'' be recertified to be used in other 
 versions.  We put ``must'' in quotes because in fact, ACL2 allows a book that 
 was certified in one ACL2 version to be included in a later version, using 
 <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span>.  But ACL2 does not allow <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____CERTIFY-BOOK.html">certify-book</a></span> to succeed 
 when such an <span class="tt"><a href="ACL2____INCLUDE-BOOK.html">include-book</a></span> is executed on its behalf.  Also, you may 
 experience undesirable behavior if you avoid recertification when moving to a 
 different version.  Hence we recommend that you stick to the draconion policy 
 of recertifying books when updating to a new ACL2 version.</p> 
 
 <p>Furthermore, all bets are off if you certify a book using ACL2 built on one 
 host Lisp implementation and include the book using ACL2 built on a different 
 host Lisp implementation.  For example, for most host Lisp implementations, 
 the Lisp reader will interpret the token <span class="v">2f</span> as a symbol; however, Common 
 Lisp allows for the possibility that <span class="v">2f</span> is read as a number.  In such a 
 case, one could use the former ACL2 executable to certify a book containing 
 the form</p> 
 
 <pre class="code">(<a href="ACL2____DEFTHM.html">defthm</a> my-thm
  (<a href="COMMON-LISP____SYMBOLP.html">symbolp</a> '2f)
  :rule-classes nil)</pre> 
 
 <p>but then use the latter ACL2 executable to include the book, even though 
 for the latter ACL2 executable, <span class="v">2f</span> is a number, not a symbol.  Of course, 
 one would expect an error because of a <a href="ACL2____BOOK-HASH.html">book-hash</a> mismatch) in such 
 case.  But these do not provide guaranteed protection against including 
 uncertified books.</p> 
 
 <p><i>Incremental releases.</i></p> 
 
 <p>From time to time, so-called ``incremental releases'' of ACL2 are made 
 available.  These releases are thoroughly tested on at least two platforms; 
 ``normal'' releases, on the other hand, are thoroughly tested on many more 
 platforms (perhaps a dozen or so) and are accompanied by updates to the ACL2 
 home page.  We provide incremental releases in order to provide timely updates 
 for ACL2 users who want them, without imposing unnecessary burdens on either 
 on the ACL2 implementors or on ACL2 users who prefer to update less 
 frequently.  The implementors expect users to update their copies of ACL2 when 
 normal releases are made available, but not necessarily when incremental 
 releases are made available.</p> 
 
 <p>Incremental releases are accompanied by a bump in the incrl field of the 
 version field, while normal releases are accompanied by a bump in the minor or 
 (much less frequently) major field and zeroing out of the incrl field.  Note 
 that incremental releases are full-fledged releases.</p>
